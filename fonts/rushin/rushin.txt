My fonts are all free.  You can use them for personal or commercial projects,
and I ask for no money.  I would, however, love to hear from you.  If you use
my fonts for something please e-mail me letting me know how you used it.  Send
me a copy if you can or let me know where I can find your work. You are under
no obligation to do this, I just like to see how my fonts get used.

A license.txt file should have been included with this font, explaining the

About the font:

Have you ever seen some Russian writing and tried to pronounce it
like it looks, even though you know probably none of those letters
are pronounced like the Latin alphabet letter they look like?
That is what this font is based on.  I took all the Cyrillic letters
and matched them up with the Latin alphabet letters they look like.
I threw out all the Cyrillic letters that didn't look like anything
and filled in the remaining characters with the regular Latin
alphabet.  The result is that you can type out a phrase and it will
look like Cyrillic lettering while being perfectly readable English.

If you like this font see Ancient Geek, my font based on the Greek
letters.
