In the future the dark web will take care of leaders and people like this. Check out the vids. on anonymous crowd funded assassinations. Hopefully behavior and butcher's will be brushed aside by tech and a new dynamic.
Blame America for this war not Russia...it is America and her allies gave Ukraine a pumping to fight the big bear of the ice...
Ukrain should attack russia .war was declared by putin . the enemy muat not be shown any mercy
Fk all communists, colonists and dictators.Long live Democracy!!!
Self defense huh. Now the world feels the need for self defense, against you. Watch out Putin!
Go Russia
Russia needs to be nuked
If they were under attack , they would allready be DEAD ,  Russia is defending themselves
Civilians have to to know when it comes to war they are soldiers 💯% to defend their country or else......!!
Prayers goes out to you all... Hosea 4 vs 6 and Galatians 5  vs 19 to 22 🙏 the book of Life is the bible...
Excellent reporting!!!
Need better defense all across the country or russians will just take over.
Putin is claiming self-defense?!?!!What an ego😤🤷🏼‍♀️
President Biden needs to loose his soft weak side and crack down on those countries.  Problem is US is to dependent on China TRADE!   ONE OF THE BIGGEST MISTAKES THAT THE US HAS MADE!  WE GET TO MANY GOODS FROM CHINA!
What's happening to Ukraine is honestly sad. My heart goes out to all the people who were affected by this. stay strong!! 💪💪
This should never happen there was all ways diplomatic solution to the problem but this was uncall for there may have been innocence civilian that  would of been killed in that atrocity from Russia
One reporter looks like he's in front of a green screen view of Ukriaine...
Why doesn't Europe have the backbone to fight this tyrany?
where is the fight for freedom America? you invaded Iraq and Afghanistan for less, I guess sanctions is your weapon against a country that can actually fight back.
Why can't the maximum countries of the world attack USA and Russia and destroy these two Demon Country for ever and stop these taking place again and again??????????????????????🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔Its these two Countries along with UK and Israel Jews, that has made a living hell for most of us Human beings.
I agree
Sanctions wont hurt a fly... gloves off and the world must save Ukraine...Ukraine was just the beginning of uncertainty...IRAN , China and  North Korea are taking notes.
I mean the president gave the order for civilians to arm themselves against russia. , so what do you think will happen when civilians engage the military?
FEAR we see in AMERICA , FEAR FROM RUSSIA :)
I can't believe how calm they were when that missile hit right in front of them!!!
it's not good mr putin why you kill innocent ucrainian peoples.i wish everything goes well.stay safe stay strong ukrainian people😪🙏❤️
NATO AND US IS FAKE.NATO AND US FAIL.1.PHILIPINE WEST SEA2.AFGHAN WAR3.UKRAINE WAR
And what were the idiots saying about pootin not planning an invasion? 
When are Europeans gonna wake the fuck up and take responsibility for their defense? They should have brought Ukraine into NATO a long time ago and this never would have happened.
Long live Russia , they built Ukrain Go tell a joke mr president of ukrain lol
Heavyweight champion usyk prayers to your family and everyone of Ukraine 🇺🇦 🙏🙏🙏
Honestly, what do the Ukrainian leadership expect when they have openly embraced pre-Western policies for decades? I live in the West and can see the manipulation of the US-based system in so many other countries as well...yes Putin is taking advantage of the situation of course, but how is he supposed to navigate a pro-western NATO / UN when they keep penalising him?
Britain can be calm! The chief of the colonial-occupational administration of the Russian Federation will continue to carry out the orders of his Western masters. Tens of tons of gold will be delivered to London on time, and oligarchs will continue to steal in Russia and send it to London. But the show must go on for the amusement of the public
Will putin rebuild everything?
We have more people filming this war on their phones than fighting it
I welcome any Ukrainian to come to Canada 🇨🇦. I will support you
May the God of Abraham, the God of Isak and the God of Jacob save your country ,From the enemy of Russia..only Jesus Christ can saved your country  of Ukrainian..
जब हर किसी को इस दुनिया को छोड़ कर जाना है तो संसाधनो के लिए लड़ाई क्यों?
This news channel is extremely one sided. Perfect narrative to drmonise the great Russia. I assure you there is a ton off Ukrainians who are with Russia.
Is anyone crying for the 1 million murdered Iraqi civilians???????
Meanwhile in Yemen
What a disgusting decision making techniques he has… pointless & repetitively failing.. Joe Biden is the most incompetent president that’s ever been. He failed at withdrawing from Afghanistan. He failed with his attempt at dictating his draconian mandates during the pandemic. He failed to help Ukraine with months of warning signs. He failed at winning the election only by stealing it. He failed to keep an appropriate approval rating. The only ones who agree with him are woke psychopaths/globalists/Socialist. Satan feeds him & he is merely a puppet for The elites. Mark Zuckerberg donated $400 million to get that piece of crap in office. they spied on Trump’s campaign & when Trump said they did they called him a liar & spreading disinformation only to find out it was true. Eventually the election probably will turn out to be true & Biden will be proved to be an illegitimate thief & not a lawful president, he sure as hell doesn’t act like it. He Repeated failure sense he’s entered office  Will continue until this bubble pops. Joe has caused inflation to Continue its rising to world war time rates. He failed with his bomb strike killing innocent children & saying it was a successful mission. Incompetence is him & his regime. His press secretary looks like a nutcase talking out of both sides of her mouth. His whole administration is a joke. He failed at everything & Nothing will change until he either dies or leaves office or is found to be unlawfully there. Joe Biden’s continuous empty threats have no effect on Putin who is in recent findings the richest man on earth next to Elon musk. WW3 is our future. Put your faith in Christ today. What a failure of a ministration…
Thats what  happens when you fu.. with  the bear  living  his peaceful life blood thirsty west
God please protect Ukrania
Pray for all the innocent 🙏🏼 they do not have a horse in this race. May they be protected
So US or UK invade/attack (iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam, Syria, Libya etc...) and they are called liberators while Russia isn't? It's either all are or none are. BBC is the zenith of Hypocrisy. It's as hypocritical as Apartheid Israel condemning Russia for invading. Guess they, zionists, are also fueling up the jets to bring in new loads of zionists from Ukraine to populate the zionist Lebensraum in Palestine
UNBELIEVABLE 🔎 🌐 💯%  💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔 I ALWAYS FEELS THAT THIS MAN 👉 VLADIMIR PUTTIN IS EVIL PERIODICAL. MIDDLE OF 🌏 PANDEMIC .WHY WHY WHY ???????? UKRAIN ARE NOT RUSSIANS BUT UKRAINIAN'S.
Путин преступник , оккупант, диктатор. Слава Украина. Казахстан с Вами . Победа Украине.Вперёд Украина. 🇰🇿❤️🇺🇦
ww3 begeined
This man his just been evil
5:01 listen to this idiot. There are basically 2 ways to deal with this, follow Russian with no adverse consequence or die stubborn, mislead by selfish usa
Lol NWAF 😅💙
NATO my ass
We learn from history that we don't learn from history.
Awful.
Heavenly Father please help my older brother is still in the army please help them all help so that this can be stop in the name of our savior Jesus Christ amen
I wonder why ukraine were not ready...to even put up some muscles....is ukraine so weak....???
Are they neighbour countries
Will be interesting to see if NATO will defend Ukraine as its not yet a NATO state. Technically it's not part of NATO yet...It will be a proxy war between Russia and Europe.What ever the case this should have been resolved diplomatly. Ukraine should have refrained itself with aligning with NATO whilst Putin is still in chair.Often the best strategy is to wait it out.
I just wish he eliminated the Ukrainian Nazis backed by the West.
Ukraine must hit back to Russian target
Protest end like this.... My god, they ended that way when people protested about the COVID mandates in the West, so why the false horror with the media
Russia, China number 1# US is a coward so its number 5# or less. US does not stand a chance in war. US shows weakness and disgrace for its people. Some people with medical problems wanted to join only to feel that they are not worthy and aren't given a chance. US saw what happen to Ukraine. Ukraine got volunteer people not ready to fight and got defeated. If US was under attack and draft people. It was the US fault we lost the war since they didn't let not just any people join the military. If US were to let whoever wants to join with medical problems get a chance to serve. They can have higher experience in war. US would gain more power if it only let's medical problem people in. No US wants normal people and leaves the special or autism people behind and they rather lose power than gaine. We the people remember US we chose what our lives would be in the future. We either fight Russia together. Or watch our country slowly getting invaded because of the US fault.
Stupid leaders go to hell, civilians are now suffering, stay safe help will come
Really dreadful
ਰੂਸ ਡੋਗ
When I heard were is NATO at to help? that got me…
what happened to covid?
covid pandemic then world war? i hope not!
Trump thinks this is 
if the free world do not act against the aggression of Putin Russia, other red country like China will follow and act the same way
Joe Biden needs to step the f*** down.Admit that the election was stolen.Reinstate TRUMPIt is our only HOPE.Fuk you Democrats
Look its very simple. NATO (America) have been courting the former Soviet States for years, wanting them to join NATO (America) so they can encircle Russia with military installations and keep them caged in. Its ridiculous to think Russia is going to allow America (NATO) to keep building military bases around them and not strike back. The world will not be safe until America stops its covert tactics of trying to govern world affairs with its strategic bases all over the world!
Did I hear war against democracy ?? TheMost corrupt nations are NATO Nations including the Americans .. what if the table was turned and the Americans were threatened by Russians installing missiles in Mexico ? How would the Americans react ? Ukraine is nothing more then a racist Neo Nazis being protected by an evil NATO and Biden ..
It is very clear that Putin is criminally insane (just like Xi) - a despicable communist terrified of democracy who wants to be Tsar of the 21st century. De-nazification? He is absolutely mad. Sanctions are not the answer - exterminations of the vermin is.
this is it the beginning of world war 3 leads to nukeclear warfare has the west and joe the the fraud biden got the guts to fight back or are they to scared  or chicken shit to fight in a real war thats right a lead up to world war right now ladies and gentlemen  on  the way to The Apocalypse
Yes. Finally! LET'S GO RUSSIA!! PUT AN END TO THIS GRATUITOUS THREAT.
My friend has autism wanted to fight for his country. Rejected because he had AUTISM. So I refuse to join the Army because why give power to a country who does not care of its people willing to fight no matter what there problem are. I rather give power to Russia or another country willing to let my friend join for who he is. If US wants more power. Don't block the people with medical problems. Give em a chance. Remember we the people. We give power to this country. We either give or you would lose your power. If US does not allow its people show they can with medical problems. Then I rather give power to the US enemies.
Japanese Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, who planned the attack on Pearl Harbor would reportedly write in his diary, “I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve.”
No one will move for Ukraine just like what happened in Georgia no one will move any soldiers to make fight against Russian army and putin and civilian will pay the cost of this political game which ended by war
Belarus is helping Putin a lot with militars and tank, the plan of attack is made very precisely long time ago
bbc propaganda in full swing
I hope this ends soon
Bank wars! Putin bails out the federal reserve. Convid dies down new crisis means huge gains on wall street  guaranteed...
Imagine you don't have a power then you try to fight Russia, it is not just stupid its also horrible to sacrifice your people for the war that you already know that you will eventually defeated.
Just another rotten feather Biden can put in his hat. FJB !
Wow, how great Russian troops are. Enjoying their success. Maybe someone has to be stupid to fight with Russia, just read their history.
Now I got knowledge that europeans starts world wars
Russia must be held accountable.  They must rebuild Ukraine.  All nations must encircle Russia and let no traffic in or out until everything is fully restored & all Russian weapons have been destroyed.  They are not 
How this EVEN OKAY??!!!
Perfect this is exactly what the fukin world needs the people in power need to be removed completely they are a cancer their ways laws are far detached from any reality what a bunch of fukin pigs what an embarrassment to all mankind WAR in a time like this bullshit
This must end in a peaceful manner
Stalin, Hitler , Chairman mao and we can add 
Im just terrified how to whole is literally watching the genocide of the whole nation and doing nothing but blocking visas and bank accounts. You guys really think that Putin cares about this sanctions? Just want to know.
Afghanistan 🇦🇫 🇸🇾 Libia 🇮🇶 Iraq
Horrified about the situation of civilians.
Hooray!!!!😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄
Putin already knew ages ago he could move upfront his pawn. It was a matter of time. This guy is one of the most dangerous man on earth.
Im not victim blaming the Ukraine but its a really that you need to take into a consideration
I’ve realised, mainstream media is very one sided.
Why?? Greed and stupidity
Why are they fleeing? Stand your ground and defend your country!
Poor babies, there no liberation for Ukrainians if Russia takes over.
This pro Russian shit is just disgusting
We need gang members to go and take down Russia they know how to use guns
Putin 
For eight years Ukraine bombed Donbass, and no one in Europe barked at the military fascists from Ukraine. The war in the Donbas lasted from 2014 to 2022.....,,,
Putin is evil.
They are all fkn nuts. Putin needs treatment in a mental institution.
Peace please stop war😢
The reason why the majority of European countries remain silent is because  they are heavily dependent on Russia's natural gas, due to nuclear power phase out campaign for the likes of political  leaders such as Angela Merkel.
And Bible prophecy is in full march, soon we will see Jesus in the sky rendering justice for the whole world.
You cannot stop war by war, KILLING BY KILLING, AND DESTUCTION BY DESTRUCTION. THE WHOLE WORLD EXPECT AND WAITING FOR PEACE. WAR IS ALWAYS BEGIN AND END WITH DESTRUCTION.
Fight back
I love how youtube censors peoples comments here. Very bias, don't get me wrong I have nothing against Ukraine but Nazi's are unacceptable in this day and age
Biden you weakling , failing by watching and doing nothing. He would be more useful as a fertilizer
War war until when!?
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
If world war 3 starts then don't be asking me to help since you forced me to take the vaccine
Eu countries specially Germany stopped import of natural gas from Russia as part of sanction.
Never trust usa
Why do people with these yuppi phones insist on shooting video verticals when they know its going to be shown on a horizontal format?
Do something NATO!!! STOP putin's genocide!!!!
How do you know when Vladimir Putin is lying? His lips move.
That'll keep the Nazi's and CIA assets from fleeing like the vermin they are. Go, Vlad! Go!!!
Why are Russians killing Russians ?
Denazification means putin is just an idiot
Please, Save the human🙏🙏🙏
Rusia wanted attack before COVID pandemia . Now they have this “exercises” how those twoface people call it
Imagine being putins wife rn
Russia again?!!!! This country never failed the history in terms of reputation.
We call on the United States to respect China's sovereignty! Abolish the US Taiwan Relations Act!
I really think the allies should intervene now. This is like Germany or Japan in WW2. Ukraine will only only give Russia a better strategic position and more captured weapons. There is a perfect opportunity to strike Russian air and anti-air while they are distracted by the Ukrainian airforce. Also Russian troops still in Russia will make perfect missile and air to ground targets without worry of hurting allied civilians. We should make them feel the pain swiftly, rather than basically giving them a slap on the wrist. Or else Russia will continue to get stronger, just as Hitler steamrolled one country after another. Instead of putting Ukrainian troops in a Dunkirk situation, we should give them the military assistance so their actions can be more effective. Putin obviously wants war, but just bc the Allies are sensible enough to not want a war, doesnt mean they should be so dismissive as to not recognize when war is unavoidable, which Russian language suggests is the case. This is the time for decisive action.
Hitler is Putin and Trudeau, and Biden .God help us all
An elderly and sleeping American president is walking in Chamberlain's footsteps America must have a president like Eisenhower or Churchill It is funny to hear America's statements (the government, the Pentagon) as if it were a television channel or a newspaper and not a responsible country.
My love Olichka, I miss you 😘 and am praying 🙏 for your country Ukraine 🇺🇦
My God help the Ukraine people.. sending prayers...it's so sad... united in prayer...🙏
Isn't there lots of minerals in Ukraine..? Like uranium...
Since Russia started a full blown war, instead of just trying to annex some territory, and many world leaders have not been able to get Putin to stop, it's only a matter of time before other countries get pulled into this, more than just sanctions. I don't think Russia can get away with taking down an entire country while the rest of the world watches, and lets him get away with it. What's to keep him from doing the same thing to other countries? The answer to that is, a much bigger war with other countries joining in. Putin has already said he'd go nuclear if that happened.
The whole world should wage war against Nazi Russia !!!!!!
Call of duty holy damn
It should be considered as a terrorist attack!ohh no they're not muslim!it's WAR!!
BBC.. Putin speech 27 minutes not 1 min 😝
Let us see how RT justifies this
Russia is saving democracy in Ukraine as U.S and their allies saved democracy in Iraq Vietnam syria iran. History repeats itself. Wonder who will save Taiwan's democracy. Because fighting with dragon's fire would not be an easy task for democracy savers.
Citizens of the West, you know, this is how your friend America started the war.  One country with another country, then move away on their own.  As Ukraine has done with it.
Great job being on location! Glad you're not wearing a helmet and flack jacket. Very professional! So, if the Russian are only attacking the military, why is the government asking citizens to take up arms!? No one is coming to rescue the Ukraine even if civilians get killed. As long as it's not a massacre, no one will flinch, if it is then the west will grimace, turn their heads away, look down and walk away... We suck!!! But didn't we just stop doing this to another country for 20 years? We really suck!! I hope Putin just kills the government, installs his puppet and slowly leaves while pulling the strings. Or is this bigger and bolder, a land grab! We pulled out our embassy! What does that signal! Not only are we not running guns around here but we're not standing up for a country on the move towards democracy. Perhaps we could have negotiated a switch to democracy or was this the end of that process before it started or after it was exhausted. I think its likely we never pressed it we they were motivated!
Fireball for destroying a civil airport ? !!!! How silly humans can  be !!!
Westrn Hypocrisy at its best.
We need love world 🌎 love and peace
This is not what civilian wanted.please have mercy on ukarine 😭
De-nazi Ukraine?! I dare Putin to say that to North Korea or to China and try to invade those countries.
Just why Russia? Just why? A military operation? In a country? Where people and children can die? A self-defense? For what? Is Ukraine a threat? Did Ukraine invade or attack Russia? De-nazification? For what? Why dont Russia try to talk with Ukrainian people? Of what they want? Ukraine have their own government and have their own peopel, so what rights does Pres Putin or Russia have to attack Ukraine? This is unreasonable and unfair for the Ukrainian people. They do not deserve this. Please, Sir Putin, I hope you see the Ukrainian people panicking, I hope you see the children, and the old people. This is unreasonable. I hope Sir Putin and the West will talk and stop this. They won't suffer, the people will. I hope world leaders become more insightful. Just please. This must be stopped.
It is funny to see that even civilians in comments try to be politically correct by not condemning Russia
I'll never understand how there can be people ok with firing those guns and missiles. If the people stood together and said no what's Putin going to do
Vladimír Hitlerovich Putin (
Well your hardly gonna stay calm when your block is being hit with missiles
So glad to be American 🇺🇸 Freedom Of Speech 🎤 and not get jailed for it.
We need to stick a nuke up Putins @ss courtesy of the USA 🇺🇲💣🇺🇲
Someone stop this crazy SOB
We warned you when Syria was being bombed, O Europe. We said that we will come to you too. But you only watched because those who died were not Europeans. Now that day has come.
Curious- How is the rest of the world supporting Ukraine? How come no one is standing up to Russia invading a country in 2022? Clearly the economic sanctions are not a detterent.
We the people of the world let’s stand up for peace love unity no war in the name of god thee almighty
why BBC sending africa man to ukraine? this is FUNNY
Russia is simply asking the west for a security guarantee! but it falls on deaf ears from nato, america, and UK! America and UK have been sending arrogant negotiators disregarding Russia's simple demand for a long time. see what happened? huge explosions! America and nato deserved the result! the result of your arrogance.
why is peace so hard to achieve? if no soldiers fight, who is gonna do it for the leaders?
It breaks my heart to see that Russian girl crying, they don't want this either and they're just suffering the consequences and caught in the crossfire because of terrible decisions by their leaders
Someone needs to go in covertly and take Putin out like they did with Bin Laden!
This cold hearted barbaric inhumane killing ppls stop please🙏😇🙏😥
Just called my relatives in Ukraine, children asking parents to leave somewhere where no bombs. But they can’t, no where to go. Now they put mattress in bathroom and sleeping in there away from room windows….
The more dead Commies the better, Putin is another Hitler
Can anyone tell me why Putin says it is done to save russia. Did ukraine attack russia before this aggression ?
자주 국방만이 살길이다
LET'S GET IT ON RUSSIA !!!
US needs to come in
No war what about love peace happiness in gods name I beg god to strike that leader that call for war god I beg of thee earthly creator almighty king of kings pour unto them ur rath cause they want no peace no love
They started bombing hospital and other important facilities so that if Ukraine needs something of necessity they couldn't.. How gut wrenching what Russia's actions are.. Such horrendous actions just for civilians' life and dreams be wrecked just because of personal grievances.
Is it balkanisation of Ukraine?! Ukraine is not Yugoslavia!?......It’s sad a modern European city Kyiv getting bombed and destroyed ! Vladimir Putin is very angry! Russian’s are ruthless, they have showed no concern and empathy for the Ukrainians.
Where was you during 7 years of Ukraine aggression?
These were American missiles
Poor birds
May god bless ukraine
Mind Begs the Question:NATO equipped to Take OnRussia over Ukraine/Gas PipelineNATO not equipped to Take OnChina over Concentration Camps?
USA Weapon Companies forced Russia to start this War for Profit ...
Is Europe really a friendly countries.  I think asean is a friendly countries
Kill as many of those commie's as you can Ukraine  🙏🙏
It's shame that I can't trust BBC anymore, no matter what BBC says
Yes president Hitler, anything you say.  What a complete dick
I don't know what to say recently my country (Myanmar) go to hell and I hear this.I hope that every living things have a peace in there hearts and that the only way will make better place for everyone.
The good thing is this they are dying and you will also die you are not going to live forever and you will pay you and your family to the fourth generation innocent blood you are just killing who are you anyway.
Terrible! No words! Unnecessary war, and loss of lives..I wish Ukraine joined NATO weeks ago.. this war would not happened
7:34 
My heart goes out to the peoples of Ucrain. NATO and US messup this country just like they did on Afganistan, Vietnam and many other.
This is presidents war 😔
Even their own Russian citizen protest... we don’t want to see innocent civilian been killed...
Google: Denver Airport Mural Rainbow. 🌈
Im Ukrainian and now live in Us for decades, miss our birds too. Its really sad they flying scared and chaotic
Emergency there are genocides happening like during WW2.  Hitler exterminated 12000000 under the guise of a typhus epidemic, and now they are doing it under the guise of a corona virus pandemic. Corona means crown, and a virus attacking the crown/government is some thing exposing government (2Corinthians4:4).  Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 can only apply to one place on earth.  Research it well to learn who has been behind slaughters for centuries! 1John5:19 is trying to stop Daniel12:4,2:44,45.  Hitler was a Catholic and never excommunicated.  Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 is orchestrating this assault against humanity, but they are trying to blame it on innocent peoples, Countries and groups.  They are responsible for boycotts, civil disobedience, sabotage, and soon to be mass killings like against the Jews, gays, war objecters(war objecters coming soon as they are starting WW3), and other perceived undesirables as in Nazi Germany.  People were rounded up to go to concentration camps because of a supposed typhus epidemic, and were gassed on the way by vehicle exhaust, or later by zyklon B rodent extermination gas with the smell taken out (h#$%@3n)cyanide.  Most of those rounded up were dead with in 70 days of being picked up.  Canada shut down a government minister on a Parliamentary broadcast when he was asking what the concentration camps they were building were for, then later they circulated that he had been fired a year before the event, now said to be the location of the most covid(corona) cases. Corrupt. Revelation mentions that people should leave the Revelation18:4 group if they don't want to receive her plagues.  (Hello, if you don't want to receive her plagues!)  According to Revelation 18 this group wears scarlet(Cardinals), and purple(Bishops).  It refers to a city Kingdom (Rome is the only city kingdom in the world), that rules over the Kings of the earth.  Where are the Kings?  The Roman Empire broke in 2 and from those 2 divisions came 10 Countries.  The Pope was the eleventh, but he got rid of 3, and from the 7 he is chosen, and there will be 10 again.  5 Countries on each leg of the Roman Empire.  The (cross or X) is on the shields of the the Empire, and it symbolizes the ten Kingdoms, and the religious beliefs.  Through time nations and peoples have not been able to sell their goods to other nations with out this mark.  According to official writings no one may buy or sell or say a greeting to any one who has left the cross.  The X or cross originates from the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet the tau, which means a mark, both literal and figurative.  In The Bible book of Ezekiel 9, God put a tau(mark) on the people who were crying over the loss of wickedness.  The mark was not for salvation.  Revelation/Apocalypse 13:18 says you won't be able to buy or sell with out the tau(mark) of the beast(Empire).  It is 1 of only 2 things that the Bible says gets you condemned, with no chance of repenting and being forgiven. The cross has been used through out history, including the Egyptians called it the ankh, which was a symbol of power.  The cross has falsely become associated with the Messiah(Christ), and that is where Xmass, and Christmas comes from.  Popes have always had a mitre(triple tiered crown) with 666 on it in Latin (Vicarivs Filli Dei).  Latin letters have a number associated with it, just like Hebrew and Greek.   Rome has called for mass destruction and sabotage to stop people from hearing this.  Government and Churches working together in self interest, not in the interest of the people.  The earth belongs to the people collectively.  1John5:19 is getting people to attack the people trying to make you free.(Daniel12:4)  Clear your browser history and cache, and YouTube search and viewing history!  Please pray for me and you! God for warned about these things happening. Their hate for Acts2:44 runs deep, and that is why Christian nations are committing genocide under the guise of a corona virus, just as Hitler did under the guise of a typhus epidemic, and falsely attacking China saying that they are the ones committing genocide.  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Wb-MNi8E-TA   The last war China fought was WW2, and that was because they were attacked.  Try reading your Bible and having a scrap of decency!  Some Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 nations have had war every year, in fact there has probably never been a year or probably a month where they were not in a war.  Government mandates vaccine for businesses over 100 people, and then Revelation 18 Church people, sabotage, boycott and quit, thus destroying the business, and your suppressors take full control again, enslaving you.  Study Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 deeply, as people are putting their life on the line for you!  Idols on Ste. Peter's Basilica, show that Rome is a complete fraud (Acts15, Exodus20, Deuteronomy 5).   Revelation17,18 is framing innocent people and businesses, and are going to attempt to get people so mad they will kill their perceived enemies. Governments issue vaccine mandates all over the world.   Businesses face huge fines if they don't comply, but Revelation17,18 causes sabotage, boycotts, protests, walk outs and people quittng, so as to destroy business.  Those trying to Daniel12:4 about 1John5:19. The Pope and the British Royals were found guilty of genocide, by the International Criminal Court, just before this pandemic. Donald J. Trump attacked the International Criminal Court by the US financial system. (corrupt) There were rioting and protests all across Europe just before the pandemic.  Italy, the seat of Rome was the first place to long term lock down, fill their Churches with dead bodies and the first to enforce the covid vaccine pass. The Pope had a meeting with mayors and governors from around the world under the guise of environmentalism pre-covid.  Read Exodus20, Deuteronomy5 and Acts15 and see about the Bible's view of idols, and you will see that it is Revelation/Apocalypse17,18, 1John5:19, 2Corinthians4:4 has caused people to break God's law by using the beast's money.  Not NWO Daniel 12:4, but 1John5:19 OWO.*  People calling it the NWO, should think, isn't this the same as the genocide and war of WW2, and plague of 1918?  Think! Copy and share this information!(video record, record in audio, text, or ?  All the things happening are to hide a Hitler like genocide.  They are attacking because of information exposing them.  ***There is two realities playing out.**  1. A corona virus pandemic and a vaccine to stop its spread.  2. Corona means crown(government) and there is a virus(information exposing/attacking the crown/government) and there is a computer/device anti virus(vaccine)(which is supposed to protect from malicious computer code) and this anti virus deletes information from your view.  Trade your digital vaccine pass for a paper one and they lose control! Reality 1 is for public consumption, where as reality 2 is Church and State. Think of which reality is really being talked about!  UK just passing laws to lock people up indefinitely, with no trial, take your kids, force tests, and send to concentration camps. UK has released tender for businesses to contract cadaver services for millions of human corpses.  Mass emergency poison purchase in Australia.  Hitler killed with odorless rat poison. Revelation/Apocalypse 17,18 ruled the world through force until the birth of the US and the French revolution, which ended the Bible's prophecy of 1260 years of domination by Rome.  Rome was beheading for observing the real Sabbath(not ((Sun)day)

Russia will finally be partitioned and will Never be an independent country again. 🙏
! Putin is killer! Fuck Russia from Goergia ! 🇬🇪 pray for Ukraine 🇺🇦💙
Putin is despicable
It's seems like, a two playing of chess, the one with more knowledge to play and the other one is amateur,
the attack is water downed compare to attack and subsequent invasion of Iraq by US and UK! US and UK killed thousands of civilians in first few hours of the attack!!! collateral damage was horrific then!
Mr Putin  and your people especially the cabinet you will pay for these innocent souls one day in Jesus Christ  name
Don’t be fooled. Biden is bimbo no. 3 in Putin’s harem. Biden plans to sanction Putin by placing grapes in his mouth.
Airport? How many deaths ?
Putin is a wicked man 😡🤬
Russians citizens should not be happy because putin is preparing a bad and terrible future for you people of russia and they will pay for any drop of blood that fall on the ground is falling on the head russians and on the head of putin and his children in the future
К сожалению, история не знает примеров, когда бы фашисты сами передавали власть.Их нужно только уничтожать. Этим и занимается армия России.А народ Украины, в большинстве своём, встречает эту армию с радостью. Таких видео полно.
He's a President. He knows what areas are vacant.
1941 all over again, but this time the invading army comes from the east
Russia should nuke western Ukraine as the USA did in Japan
Finally Putin saved Ukraine .... Now all Nazi traitors are heading to Europe ... Good luck
But, but, but, Putin promised though! Damn, and I thought a KGB manlet with little man syndrome, and the mentality of a mobster could be trusted. Oh well, I'm sure he'll hold too his promise not to continue through to other countries.
I wonder where were all the media when America  destroyed  houses and killed children women in Iraq , Syria , Afghanistan  . Hypocrite westerns
Putin responsible the dead the innocent ppl. He is evil man he have to pay the price . We want peace no war pkease 🙏🙏🙏
Prayers up for Ukraine 🇺🇦 ❤️
leaders are playing badly and horribly ,  finally normal people  are paying the debts  why  ?
Truly...where is NATO?#Abandoned
Just heartbreaking. Putin won't get away this with this..
Blood on politicians esp Ukraine's own and those who elected them into their positions. Very foolish of Ukraine to disrepect a powerful neighbour's legimate defence concerns!
Please, help us!!!
Russian dead will mount, they forgot about their misery in Afghanistan, plenty sent back home in body bags. !!
Why Ukrainian leaders have been killing Donbass people for 8 (eight !!) years?! They thought they would never be responsible for that?
Putin is a piece of trash. Ukraine is a peaceful country and doesn't want anything to do with Russia.
Fight to the last man.. it will be costly.. but you can win. Afghanistan 2.0 for Russia
Why those devil stop killing off the innocent I hate those dirty leaders they don’t have no love we don’t want no war what about peace and love
I fell sad about the news..
This is so absurd. In 2022. A war of conquest?? Really?? WTF.
Turn to Jesus people he died for your sins, Repent of what the New Testament describes as sin. Believe the gospel obey the teachings of Jesus documented in Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Jesus is the only way to be saved, be baptized by faith in Jesus you can live life with him as your example. If you need prayer i'll pray for you. If you want to keep contact with a brother in Christ i’ll keep contact with you. The love of God is beyond our understanding. God bless.
mna nato serqng rusia dia
It sickens me that regular people, civilians, people I could have had a chance to meet in there, share a drink, joke with and have a good time, are being attacked, bombed, having done absolutely nothing wrong. We are no longer in the dark ages, for fucks sakes, there is 0 reason to murder innocent people. I am just shocked, heart goes out to everyone In ukraine, I hope you all stay safe and survive this.
Putin is a demon 😈 hurting innocent people. God will judge him.
God 🙏🙏 is coming back repent now before it's too late to.
man 😔
this putin is poisonous  for this world ...
Putin your problem is land territory. Not the innocent people. Pls come to dialog mode to resolve. Go to international Court. What are you going  to get People's angry both your country  and ukraine. War is not  a Solution for your problem. Hitler did not have success
Your translation is critically incorrect. You do not even know the language.
Jesus is coming
GOD BLESS UKRAINE
in my opinion, even people who don't live in Ukraine but are close have the right to be scared. That's terrifying! (Ukraine is one country away from me :'))
Oh my God have mercy on ukraine in Jesus our savior name Amen...Amen
i really dont want this conflict to escalate, but on the other hand, i want to see what the outcome of raptor vs felon would be, yeah i know im kinda not right in the head.
The world has gone to hell.... The past 3+ years have been the strangest in this 50 year olds life.
Praying for Peace Russia and Ukraine .
President Putin, your justification is not allowed by Modern people and your ancestors in the whole world. rYour ancestors are probably being pushed off the cliff of Heaven by other holy spirits now.  Be ready to go to hell.
Ukraine military should move fast to defend their country... They must unite in defense of their own country.
Russia 🇷🇺💪
Putin is wick and satanic agent that Satan using to drink blood he is a blood
It is not a war, it is a special operation of demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine!
God be with the people of the Ukraine 🇺🇦 ! 🙏🙏🙏
Putin is miss using power
But we're woke.😳
Bomb moscow! Do something, fight till the last man can't let Russia take Ukraine unopposed
💔🙏🙏🙏🙏🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏😭
Nuke Russia, Putin sucks dick.
This reminds me of american invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan.
I can't believe Putin is going to take Ukraine in a week ? Putin got them scared !
Because of the evil Ukranian government, the common people have to pay the price. Victory to Russia
This is what happens when the most powerful nation (America) elects the weakest President (Biden). We all get what we deserve.
MAY ALMIGHTY GOD HAVE MERCY UPON THESE TWO NATION, MAY GOD FORGIVE THEM AND RESTORE PEACE BETWEEN THE TWO NATION 🙏🏾🙏🏾. PSALMS 35:1-15.
Only 3 russian people against war ?Hypocritical  BBC
satan putin
He doesnt want to destroy it. He wants to own. If the president cares about his country and its people he should walk away feom presidency and let putin take over and end the war. I am Ukrainian and live in usa for over 20 years. Ivano Frankivsk where airport was bombed is my city. This war cannot be won be Ukraine. And involving USA will only bring more bloodshed. For the sake of his own  people the lresident of Ukraine should walk away and stop this war, because at the moment he is the only person who is capable of preventing many more deaths on all sides. ❤
I have an updated version for the propaganda poem by To Huu in Vietnam Land reform 1953“Kill, kill again, the hand never stops for a minute,For paddy rice growing fast, taxes will be done quickly,For the long-lasting (communist) party, walking together with one heart,Worshipping chairman Mao (Zedong), worshipping Stalin to the eternal
Sad situation that those people going through a war. People should have and live a peaceful life and not oppression.
It's not Putin vs Biden, It is just Putin wet dreams of being the 2nd Hitler.
putins gone insane and needs to be couped.
How’s does Russia feel afraid of a country that small?
If it were to come to WWIII, not to worry. Our commander in chief (Brandon) is a very competent leader. What could possibly go wrong. I served for ten years. I would be quite skeptical of his decision making during a war that involves the US. Those poor folks in the Ukraine and Russia are going to suffer terribly all because of Putin. One man. God help them all and us, if we get involved.
For this totally responsible western,  NATO also. If they don’t support Ukrainian than why they provoke RUSSIA
THIS IS THE START OF WORLD WAR III & it will usher in such transformative change that hasn’t been seen since World War II. The economic order is going to shift from the West (America & Europe) to the East (Russia & China). Christians, there is NO RAPTURE YET! You must be ready for this transformative change!!!Many churches are not preparing their members for what HAS BEGUN!The U.S. dollar’s days are numbered… as is the standard of living in America. Please understand my warnings are not to sound like a broken record, but because time is very short in preparing. Things are going to move very quickly now.PLEASE GET READY!
Fuck Russia 💩
I dont think the Russians will keep calm if the west continuingly sanctions themIn fact the west need their economies to proceed sanctionsBut they need their industries farms lands banks etc to be the toolsThen the Russian would probably destroy these tooEven the west will loseSo dont star any provocationThese brands will diminish n lost forever Mers BMW London Bridge Eiffel tower MU Barca Ferrari Nudist Beaches McD kfc Starbucks .... n on n on
As always, the biased BBC.
If US and other democratic countries don't respond with heavy millitary force to this Russian invasion of Ukraine,the message they would be sending to countries like China and Iran would be that they are not ready to fight to defend other democratic countries amd their allies ,and it won't be long before China attack Taiwan and Iran attack israel.This is time where by Nato need to put a foot down and respond to Russia with millitary force,otherwise it's useless at this point.
A seriously ill man is delusional and starts war - won’t someone carry him to hospital for treatment of Parkinson’s? Among other ailments, like cancer? Come on. Putin’s move to war is sign of illnesses. It’s insane. 🥸 And stupid. So hold an intervention and end this ridiculous maniac’s ego madness.
Why did Russia invade Ukraine to prevent them from joining NATO? Why does Russia have a problem with NATO doing military exercises on Russia's border? Is it really a mystery?
Cast all your anxiety on Jesus Chirst because he Cares for You.(Peter 5:7)
I wished the bbc expressed this type of concern when we illegally invaded Iraq and Afghanistan
OMG! They should come to canada
get out demons of Wolyn stay were you are do not escape like a rats to Poland
Farking US and allies pushed for this and they are getting it now.
I dno if to listen to Putin or western media of what's happening 🧐🧐 such different stories
Asking Joe Biden to try to fix this is like asking the thief to install your alarm system. Has the Intelligence of a box of rocks
Nato pushed Russia to war and now sitting in side lanes sipping their tea watching the former Soviet sates tearing each other apart while the innocent people suffer. Well done USA
Coward Putin.
🙏🇺🇦🙏🇺🇦🙏😭🇺🇦🙏
Oh make no mistake it's not Bidens war. The war is between Putin and Ukraine and its people, which you are one of its people.
He is a monster. Those poor people.
I have a bad feeling from this. That’s what I was scare off since the beginning of the tension between Russia and Ukrain with the warming of France and America. Now that he didn’t listen to the warning ⚠️ and in contrary attacked Ukrain still. What will happen now?? This is the beginning of a big war that will start if we don’t do nothing. People take note of this and be aware. I said it. I am sorry but this is so stupid. All of this just for more land power and money. That’s sad. Peace to the ones that already lost their life into this and may God bless 🙏🏽
Metro 2033
This footage is old its mixed in with recent... no one has died. this report has not been confirmed!!
Russian people need to call for peace , it’s Putin ego , it’s only Putin that want this war just him it goes back a longtime an to not stop an think how many children will be killed he has no heart hope his daughter is safe they would already have targets on there heads Putin has blood on his hands children blood  , war is not the answer as he will find out , China looking to invade countries to now this is the start of world war , the nuclear one where nobody will live to tell the story
man this shit is crazy
When Russia say they have no intention of doing something you may as well count on it happening. Like when he told us those two hitmen only came to Salisbury to see the cathedral. It’s like ‘anti-truth’. So hard for people outside Russia to equate with this, as it is also the massive amount of internet and social media trolls pushing the authoritarian line constantly. It’s another way of living, where truth and lies are so easily interchangeable.
BBC played a hand in this catastrophe by their relentless propaganda to put Biden in office. Here is the fruit of your folly
Russia needs to be treated like North Korea now, a rogue state cut off.
سبحان الله وبحمده سبحان الله العظيم
Praying for Ukraine
These symphatizers just wants likes.. how cringe
Again this is americas fault they forced ukrain to join nato(national terrorist association) so bassicly they can put missles on russias dorstep and putin warned them not to do that for years and this is what happend they forced putin to defend his country
So in war,they bomb everything? 😭😭😭😭I thought they fight in a open field not in the area where people live😭😭😭😭OMG….Sad😔😔😔😔😔
what was the wispering at 8:22
It's going to get much worse and next year worse and worse and worse because the Bible prophesied it. History repeats itself and Jesus is coming soon. Rapture Marantha
Never have heard you people greef for Avganistan, Irak, Serbia, Siria. Now you have empathy. This situation is made by West.
Cowardly western leaders are the reason Putin felt emboldened to do this, lay this at the feet of the Biden's, Trudeau's, Macron's and Arderns of this world. Weak men create hard times but urban western cat ladies continually vote for fools!!
Biden wants everyone to take to their weapons now !!!! 🤦🏼🤦🏼But wants to disarm his own country.. what a tool 🤣🤣
No one wants War. The only people who are okay with War are the 60+ year old politicians lining their pockets.
I wish this war finished!!!!
Send the clown Zelensky  to the USA and let him share a room with Juan Guido.
Up until now, does anyone know why this is happening? It was so random
No other countries in europe can stop this Russia's invasion, besides stop it itself.
I hate Russia.
NATO should attack Belarus, fast and underfoot. For punishment !!!
Y these brainless politicians ego fight & civilians r the ones who suffer 😒
We have so much to live for imagine what those people felt...
Take News channel 😜😜😜
Imagine having a toddler or new born in a war zone :(
ukraine is doom. this mess was made by the west not russia.
Europeans who continued to rely on Russia for their energy sources, which invaded the Crimean Peninsula 8 years ago, can only be called stupid.
7:59;  Why you throwing my 
Biden has close ties to Ukraine. What’s he hiding?
The same statements given by most westerners n the AmericansThe public regret itEven the said bias UNNobody in America wanted to invade Libya Tunisia Iraq Syria n AfghanistanBUT that happenedNo one really cares about the suffering'sSo war is the said the best solutionWait the worst is comingI hope n pray that the war spread into western Europe especially into England n the Americans homelandThen everbody in the west tasted the reality of warGod bless what lm praying
US did this...NATO Out of Eastern Europe!!!
May allah bless ukrainian civilian save them from this atrocity  my heart crying for children and old💔😥
De-nazificiason..?
Fuckkk russia
Of course, military points !
DID,, DOES,, YOUR  HEART,,, BLEED,,, FOR ,, BOMBEDYEMENI,,, PEOPLE,,,,, AS WELL,,,,,ORNOT,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Never trust the West who always courage people to support free country, but look what is happening in Ukraine now, no other free country to join this fight.
When will we realize the futility of war
It's hard to imagine a country being invaded in this modern age.
With Army reservists and conscripts stepping in ,and weapons being distributed everywhere in Ukraine,we can vision a street to street battle and a situation like Grozny!
Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Palestine   where   is   B   B  C
the fascists in kiev  deserve everything they get. for allowing their fascist government to wholesale murder and bomb the civilians in the donbass for over 7 years. fuck them all. let russia sort them out.
Hol up what did Ukraine do why do Russia think they did we all know that Russia just want Ukraine so Putin die
If I see that coward Pooptin 💩one on one,  I'll tell it to his face he's a coward. A coward behind bunker.
Is an invasion not a military operation?
Save the civilian's❤️🙏
I thought 2022 was gonna be better…
The zombie siren. Please release the virus before we die. I wanna live in it for a day
Ukraine initiated the attack first at Donbas against pro Russia citizens, so this was the obvious result.Ukraine's president wanted a war, now the World will go to WW3 and probably a nuclear war for his stupid decision 🙄
21st Century Barbarism : 
The BBC will tell you what to believe
Is this CNN
ALL HAIL RUSSIA!! ALL HAIL VLADIMIR PUTIN! GENIUS MAN!!
This looks like August 31,1939 all over again
Everyone in their current time period thinks they are living in the 
US will be invaded by US, iran, turkey, germany and china soon in the bible prophecy..
Belarius needs a new head of state boys & girls LEGion is dead ?!? DJMD
Seeing war at this modern day where all the world can see and feel via internet, this is so horrible.
#ISTANDWITHRUSSIA
My heart break down 🥲🥲🥲
The Bible said at the second coming of Jesus Christ there will be  wars and rumours of wars. May God intervene for them.
what casualty’s ? you say it but show nothing!
why do people continue to pray for peace or pray for this or that when it doesnt work at all? they prayed for putin not to invade. he did. is putin stronger than prayer or is it just made up and doesnt work?
Hey Putin keep it up god will deal with u have been warned take heed
Ukraine isn't democratic. They oppress their media and opposition.
I want the world to die!!!!!!
I bet they're glad the trusted Americans to vote for a competent President. Let's Go Brandon
I just want to see what Russia have developed and see what the US and other countries will do...kill yourselves Africa is watching you!
This is extremely pathetic, unreasonable and unacceptable. NATO has to fight for Ukraine and see the end of Putin's regime.
President of Ukraine pay for it. For his mistakes innocent civilian get killed by Russia.
Putin's fears are valid that NATO is there at his borders but war on sovereign independent Ukraine is not answer. Russian people should rise up and throwout tyrant Putin.
Can’t believe it. This is the worst nightmare ever! Can’t believe we are on 2022 and didn’t learn from the pass world war 1,2 please stop it before it is too late. If a war start no one will be safe no one so please please this is horrible.Spare innocent people life. Spare human life spare our planète just stop 🛑 before it is too late. Note that everything on this world is vanity power money material all is vanity. Innocent people gonna lost their life for this stupidity.
This seems De-javu. It reminds me to the invasion of Irak by the OTAN under the justification of looking for weapons of mass destruction. Irak was destroyed, hundreds of thousands of civilians died, children, women, later we learned, it was a false flag.The same happened in Syria. The history repeats itself . Now is Russia the invader, then maybe China will do the same. Who knows!
My heart breaks for the people of Ukraine 🇺🇦💔😢 this is too much
So sad 😞 pray 🙏 for and end to this madness
He is orthodox , but not a GOD fearing person , no sympathy ,
That guy is right if Russia does not stop in Ukraine it is the beginning of WORLD WAR III
Welp we all goin to war
Never trust never depend on Western powers...they are useless as they were in Afghanistan
The Ukraine has a corrupt government that has engaged in Nazi genocide against the ethnic Russian minority. Hopefully Putin can liberate this nation from democratic tyranny & restore stability.
I’m so sorry! I can’t stop thinking about you . The evil that men do is stunning. Direct us to a site page so we can send the stuff you need. What a horrible thing that is being done to you.
Bad
You forced him to attack.
When Syria and Afghanistan iraq was under attack where your camera was ? War is good for USA so they can sell their weapons to both countries
Tanzanian🇹🇿🇹🇿🇹🇿🇹🇿🇹🇿were standing with Ukraine 🇺🇦
Biden.....I did this.  Enjoy your...ah, what was I talking about? Oh yeah!  Gas prices!
This is heartbreaking all those poor women and children and innocent
Hope there's alot of dead Russians just like the got destroyed against  Afghanistan, how quickly they forget .
Wouldn't it have been great if Joe Biden solved this problem when he was vice president instead  of taking  Hunter there to get a million + a year job and shrucking his job.  GO JOE  GO
The problem with Vladimir Putin..... Is he's a psychopath...... You don't think I'm right about this think about this..... Russians are married to Ukraine s.... These two countries intermarried for hundreds of years....it is quite normal for their families to be on both sides of the border.... Grandparents children..... Literally you couldn't be fighting people who are any closer to you than this... Brother versus brother... And rather than in a spirit of love and respect....... For your relatives....this psychopath Putin has decided that killing his family is not a bad way to go...... In the US we could not kill Canadians.... We could not invade Canada..... They are our relatives......
War isn’t bad it’s crazy bad and  horrible
🙏 for peace
Judgment
This is all part of the WEF's 
President  of Ukraine A previous comedian with zero diplomatic experience Not to mention corrupt to the core
Putin really says it was Self Defense. Even his bullshit propaganda isn’t even making sense.  It’s good that Russian citizens are protesting against Russia’s attack on Ukraine.  Protesting against Putin is extremely dangerous to do, as the police will beat & arrest anyone for protesting. But the Ukraine People are ones who suffer.  How can Putin want Ukraine so much, but go on to destroy it just to get it, with millions of lives in jeopardy. Just pray for Ukraine people. Even if they have to leave & lose Ukraine, as long as they live through it Ukraine will survive through them.
Give me your address so I can sent you a tin foil hat
Trudeau must be relieved that his assault on freedom in Canada is temporarily pushed out of the news due to the Russian actions, but he still stands condemmed for his SS style removal of human rights
Hope Ukraine has allies.
Fuck NATO fuck USA where are they now?
Ukraine want a world war. Let them fight on their own and let this war end soon. Evil people on both sides and propaganda all around. This conflict is a setup they poked the bear and want us all to die fighting for it.
All this blood is on bidens hands
Lutin must be stop! UN stop that madman
I hope Russia makes them pay a high price for being western puppets!
Lord God, please make Putin and the Russian GOVERNMENT STOP!! Lord let this NOT to continue. Please Lord, bring it to the. Stop the lies, and end this terror. In your Holy mercy Lord, we humbly pray from our hearts for everyone being affected. Have mercy on them, bring peace tot them. Help the lives of the ones who has already lost family, over 200 precious lives and creations of you Lord.Lord,  have mercy, end it now, please God. Amen
Why you people like war .Killing civilians destroying buildings instead of living peacefully.
Get Putin on the world's most wanted list like Bin Laden was and Hussein before him, he needs to pay heavily for his war crimes!!
Better both presidents to have pistol in an open field... To end the war in short time.
Dam that’s crazy
god speed
If no action is to be taken by NATO, then just dismantle it. NATO has no guts to touch Russia! Shit!
Can’t believe a modern European city  Kyiv  getting bombed and destroyed, Vladimir Putin knows  Russia better than his predecessors! This war has a legitimate reason, Ukraine was Russian territory,and NATO is meddling in Russian matters.
Where the fuck it the Ukraine military
You bigots and hypocrites make me sick with your comments about your imagined broken hearts and fake prayers!
If the world stands by and watches the country of Ukraine be invaded and taken over and absorbed by putin then no place in the world is safe because apparently nobody cares what happens. Pathetic that things have gone this far and still no country is coming to the rescue of Ukraine.
Can't people just be left alone????
Damn only him? Wow , he's must be in charge of what happens all over the world, Jesus Christ Biden this Biden that, you guys only know one language
 @Miguel Lopez  oh its more then just him. It's a massive gaggle of  Incompetent A-holes
The sign of the times the Lord is near 🙏🙏🙏
Putin's an evil devil, and so is Trump for routing him on. Two jackasses.
PUTIN PISS…
The NATO is a useless shit!  Can't they simply fire a few missiles into Russia and cause some damage to it?
Please mr. President Putin pls stop the war russians and eukranian hoping for peace we pray so much we love you all russians friends pls and many filipinos looking for job in eukrain  thank you sir
Killing people for land? Smh. Fuck War
Fake news. But, couple of thing’s argumentative!
When the US bombed Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, etc. few were shocked even though millions of civilians died. On the contrary, you even sent weapons and soldiers to help the Americans. But you called them 
Biden admitted providing 650 mln worth lethal military aid to Ukraine, - for what??were US and Ukraine preparing for war to take over Donbass or overtake Crimea too?
Nothing less than Taliban, even worse.
This war is only supposed to go on for 5 days but the damage is big for just one day!
if the people dont want Putin.....throw him out .   the Russians are guilty as much as Putin.
🙏🙏 God protect them.
Putin. Just a filthy liar trying desperately to prove his masculinity and using the lives of his people and Ukrainians civilians to do it. Pathetic.

The free worlds stands united with the brave people of Ukraine ! 🇺🇦
Ahh run for your lives civillians
Parts of Russia doesn't support this, Ukraine doesn't support this but American Conservatives, well just read the comments.
Lol
This is not what people wanted this is what demon wanted using leaders that consume by power.. this is not inhuman.. stop war we are more civilize now.... Or leaders are not?
Its not keeve , its kiev
War always started by cowardly leaders
Putin has lost the plot completely.
BIDEN AND TRUDEAU ARE PROUD OF THE UKRAINE ARMY FIGHTING IN HIGHHEELS AND LIPSTICK,RUSSIA IS VERY SCARED OF MEN FIGHTING IN HIGHHEELS AND WARNED HIS SOLDIERS BEWARE OF THE LIPSTICK AND HIGHHEEL FIGHTERS
Do they really need to do this? the people dont want war . all this is doing is putting people in hardship , =/
Shock and Awe!
Russia will always view the US and the rest of the West as a threat to their people and ideology. That's the whole point of this attack. Imagine they even sniff a whiff of the other countries near them becoming more like the West. If they aren't part of NATO, then Russia can go to town on them just like Ukraine and getting away with it by threatening obliquely with nuclear war if anyone interferes. Is that how it will be forever because Russia knows noone wants a nuclear war?
He said 
Putin sounds like he received the Elite Covid treatment, with Antibodies and steroids that make old men angry as fk.
Right  History lesson. 1. History repeats itself.2.Russia is an Empire. There are enclaves of Russians in all the territories. So they can claim hegemony when they are actually invaders.3. Hitlers pretext was also about Getmanic territory....again invader enclaves claiming hegemony.4. Let Putin bog down in Ukraine and encourage revolt in the rest of his Empire. Like Chechnya Georgia etc.An Empire is not a Homeland.5. These criminal oligarchies of which Trump is one, all kiss butt in a hierarchy. They do not like equality. Tgey are bullies and cowards.Kick their butts.
Imagine the death count.... there were people in there.....
putin is a war criminal! What will Joker Brandon do  with a war criminal?
🤣🤣🤣🇷🇺👏
Забыла сказать одну интересную вещь. Лидер Украины Владимир Зеленский - выходец из России, прекрасно по-русски говорит. В прошлом он выступал на российском телевидении в качестве ведущего телепередач. А еще раньше Зеленский был участником программы КВН, где команды студентов со всей России 
What is the matter with these people? Does there have to be another stupid war? Even Hitler got fed up with it at the end.Insane!
So many innocent people will lose their lives in Ukraine . Normal working people, families and children who are just innocent and helpless. This is truly devastating. We need peace in the world, no more war. I pray Russia stops and the world unites to stop this war. We need peace.
Where is the US defence support for Ukraine? My prayer goes to Ukraine ❤️🇿🇲
This looks to be another Kabul.
Oh yeah. The Russians version of peacekeeping is getting rid of airfields. And the Chinese term for invasion doesn't include rolling tanks into another sovereign country.
I don't believe people of the 2 nations hate each others, but Ukrainian leaders who are puppets and depending on USA have a plan to join the Nato which is not an added value to Ukraine and a stupid move toward the 2nd most powerful nation which is Russia. Ukrainians should change such leaders and back off threating Russia
we can add this to the Biden fail list
This is so sad😥😥😥 poor innocent people. Pls stop the war..🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Joe Biden And His Squad,  Love Destruction. They Will Face GOD, On Judgement Day.
Stay strong Ukraine From Thailand.
Jesus Christ is coming repent is not too late at the end of the world Mathew 24:1-51 rapture is coming
IN UKRAINE IS A FASHIST COVORNAMENT
The innocent people had done nothing wrong 😑 like why ? , bomb the leaders instead of the population
Emotional manipulation!!!!!
What is the fault of this innocent children and people.. can u figure it out.. because of this political nonsense and idiotsm... Power and will.. are this leader are still human!?
Vladimir Putin is just fighting fascists just like ANTIFA. I thought liberals were against N@Zls.
I hope this ends soon 😓
Courage 😥
Whatever putin's reasons were, this is very selfish, heartless and irresponsible... i hope he is happy.
#BBC #BBCnews #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦 #GiveMeLiberty🗽orGiveMeDeath🇺🇸♠️ #YeahYeah🐦 
War propaganda!!!
Funny how the same people in the comments praise Israel when they bomb Gaza and Syria
I guarantee if Bush, Putin, Hitler and Hirohito had to be at the front of the wars and invasions they launched tens of millions of people would never have died.
Honestly, these people in power don't understand history. No matter how much ground you take over, or defeat a country, it still will always have people that will rebel against the occupants. What's the point of all this?
they took it without any resistance !no one resisted!not a single peaceful house has been destroyed!Putin go ahead!
Stupid woman at 8.03 this is how the propaganda can take effect!
#SAVEPEOPLEFROMRUSSIA #SAVEANIMALSFROMRUSSIA 😭💔
Putin isn't going to heaven, he has a date with the devil.
人間は過去の歴史から学べない動物なのでしょうか。
How are we ever going to progress as a species with events like these taking place? Imagine making contact with an extraterrestrial civilisation in this day and age! Someone would attack them!
Why cant all humans just get along?? Honestly it just breaks my heart :(
This remind me of the situation in Afghanistan 🇦🇫
NATO isn't going to get involved because that LITERALLY would start a world war. But unfortunately without their help it's a lost cause trying to fight back, Ukraine has such a small army with limited resources compared Russia. For the sake of innocent lives I would urge them to just surrender and then fight for your freedom after, but at the same time I totally understand fighting for your country and its freedom. I've never had my country invaded by a bully. Really feel for these innocent people...
SO YOU WAKE UP THE BEAR 🐻SO NOW YOU WILL SEE WITH IS RASSA ALL ABOUT
The United States should nuke the living crap out of Russia and get rid of them once and for all.
Russians who don't support Putin on this are puppets of the west or not aware of the fact
Peace please ❤️🙏🏻
Dictator's listen to one actions and that's violence, sorry but history shows use this, this is personal with Putin and the world needs to to take notice and act swiftly because China is watching very carefully???
Adolf Is in the bunker thinking f#ck the Russians are coming again
You cannot go into somebody else’s home and claim self defense…. I’m not sure how that makes sense
These mfs dont even know why russia attacks Ukraine…. So sad man
I got so many Ukrainian and Russian friends... because of the job I often have to have a new encounter.This is horribly wrong what is happening here, this man is insane and should be stopped.As Hitler did years ago, He is the same kind of menace and we should do all we can to stop someone like him.How ironic Putin calls them Nazis when he is actually the real SS commander here.
We are too evil...all of us
You know they have more nukes than the US and they're also more powerful like TSAR Bomba.
 @Marco Villela  I guarded nuclear warheads for the trident submarine in Bangor Washington, there were 65000 of them each warhead is 100 times more powerful than the bomb we dropped on Japan.
Do you think Russia isn't capable of erasing the US from the map? 😂
 @Omar Syr  they could, so what? It's going to happen sooner or later let's do it get it over with.
Keep Ukraine out of NATO!!!!
This is all game played by USA 🇺🇸
They gonna just let Russia steam roll them. Russia doesn't care if people die . Yes some people will have to die to fight back but u have to . Or this will just be a prelude to whatever he decides next.
Ukraine gay don't even response
SEE, HEAR, BE SILENT
Time for regime change in Russia!
🙏💔
coward 🇺🇸
President Putin said in self defense,what an idiot! I can't wait to see the day that he'll go under ground like Saddam Hussein.
Kill a snake 7 inches deep.
Why is there no news on Ukraine fighting back
Because of Putin, thousands of people who had relatively normal lives just a few days ago have had this ripped away from them. This is a crime against basic human decency. Putin's war is deeply unpopular with Russians too. Cover that angle too please

I can’t believe this is actually happening😕
Ukraine people please fight till your last breath

Leaders like Putin won't stop sadly their egos over throw their sence of thinking what's right or wrong
What an absolute liar....who is killing people? Who is dangerous? Outrageous!
We are sending prayers 🙏 and luv to all holding on hold tight and let's hope for the best it might be rough but we all hope it get better fast
Putin is pute evil
🇺🇦
Ukraine President and Biden, is the worst President when it comes to negotiation. Instead of Prioritiizing the safety of their people and preventing a World War. Their EGO is so high, they want to control Russia and want Putin to kneel on them.
In the kind of situation the best thing is just pray for them
12/144000🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🗡🩸
What's the world nations ? Very sad situation
Omg horrible thing I've seen

Where is U.S.A lol
NATO proxy war as usual , and like always , death and desolation , Iraqies, Lybians, Afganies, Syirians , Yougoslavian , wish Ukrainiens good luck for being a geo strategique toy of NATO .
Overthrow Putin now, Russia.  Or this will be Sochi, Moscow and St. Petersburg soon.
May God protect the Ukrainian people. This war must be stopped.

Pray for Ukraine https://youtu.be/rGUBVpuFMj4
USA IS FRIEND THAT SAYS DONT WORRY FIGHT I AM HERE  . AND WHEN ACTUALL FIGHT BEGINS THEY RUN🤬
Our Father in heaven please take charge of the people in Ukraine, please have mercy on them...in Jesus Mighty Name Amen!
Putin is real evil.
Clearly as demonstrated Ukraine was no threat to Russia militarily.
putin is a monster. I kill monsters
Putin clearly explained and warned long before. NATO is full of shit and Zelensky is stupid for not planning to protect your own people or fight back. It's too late now. Let Putin have a deal or WW3.
Ukrainian Citizens should start doing guerrilla warfare
https://youtu.be/Sm8QfxZ3HHw. Read your history. There is more to this issue than Ukraine Good, Russia Bad.
Putin didn’t start shit
Fuck you all. Fuck Trump,  Fuck Clinton,  Fuck Obama, Fuck Biden, Fuck Bush. Duck Reagan. A whole bunch of rich people get to decide if you live or die.
Defend Russia from those invaders and Putin don't forget what gringos and Europe did to Libya Afghan Cuban Venezuela and every country they touch...Defend your country from those assassin
Korea
Denazification, says the Oligarch Dictatorial Ultra Nationalist
What is this all for? I do not get how people could have that much greed. Because what is all these if not greed?? Blinded by greed that people's lives do not matter anymore. They cannot be human anymore to have this much greed. So sad. Heartbreaking.
And the winner is !! the deciever , the manipulator , the devil  the coward ..   Lord '  protect  Ukraines  people 😥😥😥
I guess NATO won’t be there to help you…unless you join itIsn’t that what the West wants?
Remember the Iraq bombed by US
Once in history before claiming territory with satisfaction France, Spain, Germany, England  many more and last but not least U.S before the Civil War. These countries crucified Natives on their land with their lies and gilded promises. Killed and raped women and children and enslaved the unwilling. What was that word they use that Biden only remembers.... oh yeah Genocide. Lets not forget to include the Catholic and Christian crusades as well.
Ukraine 🇺🇦 is now like Afghanistan 🇦🇫. Those afraid of the incoming regime of a Putin-friendly Ukranian government have either die fighting or leave the country.
the true nazi returns...
Love Russia from Serbia 🇷🇸🇷🇺☦
He know what he is doing
He looks fat, weak
Also putin
trump, putin eats bigger pieces of shit for breakfast
Putin. Money cannot save him, or Jesus.  Now he has to answer to me, and to you.  #mussolini
Remember when 2 planes crashed into the twin towers? What does you pathetic smear comment have to do with Ukraine? Loser
Russian is a big country yoockrin is small country
This gives me severe anxiety!!! Wat does mean for the rest of the world...is a 3rd world war looming???
USA and RUSSIA are todays enemy of mankind
the 7th most corrupt country on the face of the planet is under attack
Hang Russia president for doing this shit
how to control COVID-19 (War) Stay at home guys
Nazi Germany, Imperial Japan , CCP China , Kim North Korea, Terrorist Iran, RasPutin Russia …The Satan mindset . birds of the same feather flock together.
what if it isn't Russians sending those missiles but the real enemy who wants to portray Russia is indeed doing these acts.
Judgment days come near everyone. Who can stop this.
USA attack Iraq Afghanistan Libya  Syria and Russia now attack Ukraine Good luck Russia I hope you're next step USA
Omg...
Russia will take Ukraine. The rest of the world can only watch patiently and administer  sanctions
Damn!Let Diplomacy Prevail!🙏
Imagine, the newest war is so widely covered by the Internet. Even daft apps like TikTok are rife with videos regarding this conflict. Mad time to be alive.
Praying for all the ukrainians under russian control, I hope the situation gets resolved soon…
its ganna be war its ganna be a war its ganna make chain reaction of the country its begining of the world war 3
Poor Ukraine 😔
Come on Western Countries, pull ur finger out of ur a$$ and get in there!! ENOUGH WITH THE TALKING!! Clearly, it's NOT working because you've been talking to this CRIMINAL since he invaded Crimea, FFS!!
И пришло, нацисткое счастье, но жалко не на 8 лет!
How is this self defense New Hitler ?
Why aren’t the civilian Russians not protesting this nonsense?
Jobiden responsible for All of this ..
My heart goes to the people of Eastern Ukraine
Putin is a mfing liar! May he rot in hell soon!
It's really sad and I do not understand America and NATO just watching it 😡
kinda what we did to afghanistan for 20 years ..
Shame on so called HUMANITY, WE are already at the EDGE due to GLOBAL WARMING and These sick war monger POWERs by all this bringing it close. The DAY NATURE will retaliate to which these Leaders are over confident about the most POWERFUL will be brought to NOTHING in SECONDs. It is so IMMATURED to behave 1914 or 1939. I PRAY to 
We could have deterred this attack by imposing a trade embargo on Russia but we didn’t because the EU gets 40% of their heating fuel (natural gas) from Putin so they wouldn’t go along.  Remember that next time the EU scolds the USA for not doing enough to wean themselves off fossil fuels.  They don’t value the freedom of 43 million Ukrainians enough to pay a few dollars more for their natural gas. Shame on them
I guess now even the maga cult idiots can now see why putin was using his orange puppet to try to defund and disband N.A.T.O.    ...without unified opposition putin can start his campaign across Europe as the newest fascist autocrat and seize territories in a hitler-like campaign.
The west is worried about getting all the pronouns right and making sure we have gender neutral toilets… western spoiled brats are about to find out how privileged they are!!
the world is doom, this earth is about to end
Putin is disgusting.  Murder of a free country.
how about the MEXICAN  boarder?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? u suck for not reporting news that truely will kill Americans. F U BCC NEWS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What is going on humans killing humans .nowander god is angry and sending obstacles on earth
How about civillian?
What In the shit is going on ?????
Bunch of lies
US needs to keep American troops away from this... It's not our fight, Russia and Ukraine are not posing a threat to American soil or American freedom... Let Ukraine and Russia deal with it's own problems and history and the American administration do the same (we have our own problems to fix). The corrupt bankers and politicians of America need this war for their own greed and power... If American troops die because of this may the blood be on those leaders and politicians heads!!Stop listening to lame-stream media, bought out by the corrupt American bankers. Critically think for yourselves! Wake up!!!!O Most High YAH, protect the faithful and believers in your son Yahshua our Messiah but let the wicked destroy each other!! 🙏🏼🗡️🔥👑
This 
Nonsense
https://youtu.be/JKAiLOMI9IE
What a BULLY
Sad to hear this news.. I will pray for all of you my dear Ukraine 🇺🇦 friends..
Russia sucks
So horrible...
Ukarine doesn't need prayers, Ukarine needs real help from NATO or the US. Sanctions won't do anything.
Put down their arms?  Ask the Jewish people from Germany prior to world War 2 if that was a good idea
Russia why ??
America and Biden to be blamed for inciting Putin for a month that Russia is going to attack Ukraine
Why nato expanding into eastern europe threatening russian security. Russia has every right to defend itself. If nato wants to include ukrain into it, then why it is not millitarily involved. This shows the hypocracy of west at its peak.
NATO need to send troops ASAP! This is how Poland fell! 🤬
Are there anyone who lives in the UK here? Tell us what you see please
He is trying to rebuild the soviet union
天佑乌克兰
They need both.
Que se deje de pendejadas y dejé en Paz a Ukrania son los Rusos los que disparar misiles y ocupan terrenos que no le pertenecen
This is damn wrong. Oh, yeah, Russia is defending itself as they bomb Ukraine. The people are the victims as governments around the world lock up citizens in each country who speak out against their government
Why in world an intelligent person counts on Joke Biden and corrupt NATO
TURKEY ARMY HELP UKRAİNE GOO TURKEY ARMY 🥺
Russians, Americans and the British are the biggest war lovers, especially the usa
The US and her allies asked for this, for weeks Ukrainian troops were shelling the Russian speaking people of the Donbass with many fleeing to Russia but Western leaders and medias turned the other corner. Instead they kept supplying Kiev with weapons. Hypocrisy at it apex
Notice there's footage of black smoke and fires.. but when using the city as a backdrop ... no black smoke .... funny that
I just went under the Russian embassy in Tokyo and there are just few protesters here in Japan (more police which is guarding the embassy) but they all support Ukraine! Fingers crossed this conflict won't escalate any further.
damn you Putin
May God be merciless to these animals , Prayers for the victims of Ukraine and Palestine
FROM THE RIVER TO THE SEA .PALESTINE MUST BE FREE
The BBC is the biggest propaganda machine out there ... FAKE news
May all be safe and warm. Well in heart and spirit and body.
This will not happen if Trump win cz Biden is so soft Russia now on rampage
Send Stoltenberg first to fight the russians.
What movie is this?
The leaders promote war but the people who suffer the consequences!!
PS  strangely enough it's so well targeted on military site's it's possible he thinks that the people of Ukraine might hold but sadly history is going to repeat itself again and maybe a horrendously horrible long war of atrocities by both sides,   maybe another Afghanistan or Vietnam War. 😈.
Insert virtue signaling comment here
Snarling -- ? I would be to if terrorists were trying to blame him for their terrorism
And why were they shelling? Could it be in retaliation for what the separatists were doing? Why don't the separatists go live somewhere in Russia?
Not a war . They are only attacking those who resist . Wave the white flag 🏳 to mommy Russia or she going to give you a whooping baby Ukraine 🇺🇦. Stop send people to die because we not helping y’allAll those military age Ukrainian men running away smh
RUSSIANS ARE NAZISTS 😭
Where is the Ukrainian military?  How can there only be 
BBC :   Broad daylight Bullshit Crap
Iam getting goosebumps
Western countries just want to condemn the Russia without doing anything to block the Russians. I am sure western countries will do anything to block the Russians if there is money to be made in Ukraina.
The whole world and the media are worried about Russia and Ukraine. While Syria Palestin and kashmir Iraq are being demolished and Destroyed. this is because the media won't report this as Muslims are labelled as terrorists in the eyes of the west
Poor ukraine people. PUTIN IS A DISGUSTING MAN MURDERER
Thought we learned 😔
How does everyone they pick speaks English. That's interesting, n not with British accent. War is terrible thing. Hope all be ok.
List of countries Russia/Soviet Union invaded - Poland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Czechslovakia, Poland, Belarus and Ukraine.
Its terrible how these world leaders drag innocent civilians into war and people die for these jerks that are in control of there lives, these government leaders are vicious and dont need to be in power
Russian bully byforce and used dirty tricks.
NOBODY IS ATTACKING CIVILIANS  nor cities !! Only military installation with high degree of precision. so stop making a big deal about it
bunch of Russian sissy tactics 👎 striking hospitals and invading under darkenss
This is horrible reportingYour live feed of a peaceful city have a different picture grain than the stock 2012 footage of old conflictsNot saying something isn't happening but your footage looks suspicious as.I can provide better video clarity on a 3 year old phone than the footage you're showing The West poked the bear.. now surprised the bear is retaliating
Putin wants to take back country what never was his to begin with.    I Stand With Ukraine, do you!?Dear Russia (Putin)If you think that country boarders should be based on History,please Give entire Russia to Mongoliawho Historically Owns it!
Why start reporting on a war that has been going on for 8YRS
'It's all just bluster''Putin is bluffing''Putin is just trying to get concessions from NATO, he won't actually invade'Where are all these people now then?
Is Putin also a terrorist?
Putin So confidently telling obvious bullshit to the world.
God help them. Hoping for as few casualties  as possible. 🌏
A brave Ukrainian fighter pilot has so far shot down six Russian fighter jets!🇺🇦🇺🇦 He’s being called the “Ghost Of Kyiv”
The Ukraine just realized that The NATO won't come to their rescue.
Don't tell me that there's going to be a world war 3
I blame America if they didn't steal the election from Trump this would never happen I don't care what anybody think I believe that
This is what the leader wanted. Civillians become refugees😡
Is this the same country Hunter Biden was getting all that free money
Only Putin can send in his military to attack another country without any provocation from other country and call it self defense.King of propaganda. What moron is going to buy this bs story. Trump and his stooges.
The Russians military is on the Ukrainian  soil. I don't know how someone is gonna call is a self-defense, not invasion.
What dezanification is Russia talking about
Everyone scared of Putin??
God Lord Jesus please stop this war
Prayers for Ukraine and all people in #Ukraine 🙏🙏 so sad😭
Obviously the strategies required are enormously huge to put this together let alone achieved,   this is why he obviously was going to do it regardless,   sadly so indeed so, 😢😨.
Well.. I guess I’m getting drafted
This is really bad
Death to Putin! if you're Russian AND NOT a complete waste of space, you would overthrow that midget; take that rabid dog out back and put it 👎
Loss of life, whether it be of soldier pilots following orders or of other soldiers defending the country its still loss of life.Whole thing is just unimaginable to me, human life turned into a number on a statistics sheet.
So when a yank go to level Iraq, it is a different story, right? Then UN will bless the invasion!!!! Yay! Go CNN!!
i am with puttin.if he  cannot handel this situation it mean NATO inved russsia soon.it is not with ukrine it is with  USA and UK.isn't why u BBC shouting.we see ur false news  in our affair/from Ethiopia/mark of independenc.pleas ukrinean think over it russia is ur sister peopel not USA not UK.
Ukraine president please step down!!!
This is not WW3 is starting. We have to start WW3 because of these 2 countries problem ? No way. These 2 countries must sort it out. It is their issue. There is something happened between these 2 countries. Who knows what happened. I only remember that these 2 countries were one. Russia and Ukraine ! Why not to become  one again ? I think that you were all happy when you were one !
The transition from old Ukaraine to New Ukraine was always going to be rough but there needs to be compromise by both....and NATO is making it worse and needs to move back or even be dissolved with a New European Alliance That includes Europe, Russia and Ukraine ....
This is so scary something coming out of a movie. My hearts go out to the ones who loved ones have passed. 🥺❤️‍🩹
My heart is with donbass ppl,who were destroyed all these years by ukrainian gov.
I guess putin was jealous of all the history channel  documentaries on  Hilter, he wants some of that action.
You've promised, OTAN (near our border) has never happened. You lied. So..Where did you find this funny? granpa)))
My heart breaks for the people of the Ukraine. This is so sad.
8:02 Putin supporter

These leaders are scum
British Bullshit Corporation
What a shame of world we have created. If this means being human... I dont wanna be
Oh yes yes, i fully trust the same BBC who have reported so truthfully on wars in Fghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya and everything before, between & since. Coz they looooove telling you the truth!!!!.....Oh btw anyone remember what Victoria Nuland did to this country a few yrs ago
That's why you should make good relation with border sharers however possible!
My heart is with the Donbass people who's lives have been torn apart by the senseless actions of Russian agitators.
Pray for Ukraine's safety🙏
This is what happens when one man has too much power.
N.A.T.O / OTAN.... Really want to have theire equipment in Ukraine.. all the west had to do is agree to no N.A.T.O Expansion into Ukraine...
The World need to President Trump
Is Joe Biden's son still working in the Ukraine for the energy company he got millions from? Lol
Yes, because if God forbid Russia made a military alliance with Mexico, Canada and Latin Americas, sell those countries more weapons, set up military bases and install many missile systems, I'm sure The piece of shit USA wouldn't invade. Or what if Russia starts a coup d'etat and install a puppet junta government and spread disinformation, oppress the Americans living in those countries of that satellite countries like Cuba, or Mexico?. Absolute hypocrisy and double standards. America and NATO bombed Belgrade without un security council, same with Nobel peace prize Obama started countless wars, destroyed countless countries, fired tens of thousands of missiles, and installed puppet governments and rapes and pillaged them of natural resources. Fuck your garbage news agency....biggest arm of  propaganda and fake news. God bless Putin and God bless Russia Ukraine and Belarus. Stop NATO expansion and destruction of traditional Christian values and destroy filthy leftist liberal Democrat antagonists.
Putin Vladimir must be eliminated immediately because the people in  Ukraine certainly don’t want anything to do with communism anymore !
Revelation 12:12 “Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.”
praying, no more war, so angry at Putin and those who support him, his reasoning is beyond crazy, cannot think of the damage upon children, people's lives, this is an example of how bad humans can be. my heart is broken
.....ALERT!!!  We are at WAR but we win.https://youtu.be/0gqZhwUIch8
Why  Putin wont    do  it  himself  because  Putin cant  Putin  is  scare  to  do it  himself chicken  shit
bias bias and bias...blaming all to puttin. why dont you ask ukraine ..u.s and nato?
The world needs to assemble to destroy this modern Hitler.
This your best time BBC reporting lies about war.....we know about yo false propaganda bBC....old n fucked like the Queen
God please help these people 😔
Always France put trouble in Africa now France and the others country's in Europe you have to help Ukraine with Power not talk talk
Navy Seals: “Here we go again…. Hold my beer.”
Please stop the war
Can't really see what value Putin see's in such an underdeveloped country. Ever since it was destabilized by a US coupe 10 years ago, everything been going down hill for Ukraine. Praying for their safety.
a comedian who is a tool used and now crying
What does he mean by 
War is the inevitable outcome always. My own father was forced to go to war at 18 just a few decades ago. Many humans know and have accepted that humans will be their own demise. This might just be a small and quick conflict, or not. Either way war never changes.
Putin is a liar and a murderer.  My heart breaks for the innocent people of Ukraine. Absolutely disgusting, Putin. Putin is truly a monster.
What really causes the fight between the two countries?
I can't imagine doing this with my family. My heart hurts for those children and families.
USA needs to step the hell up!!!! Help this country!
this doesn't make any sense .  praying for all innocent lives
I was once a fan of Putin. But now no more👎
So who's going to man up and go snipe Putin?
Russia need to destroy the enemy,Ukraine is the enemy of Russia!!!
With todays technology Ud think u cud of evacuated everybody n Ukrane. & WHEN PUTINS TROOPS CROSSED THE BOARDER HAVE 10,000 Drones n the sky dropping bombs& spraying bullets. I no it wud be xpensive but if it would save ppl from dying do it.  SO GLAD SEEING RUSSIANS PROTESTING  PUTIN
РУССКИЙ ВСПОМИНАЙТЕ СКИ!!!!!
Every thing is turn by turn
Putin looks frightened, exhausted and confused.
I totally agree this is the 3rd World War
all that Russian armor ...... that is what I call a target rich environement.
russia & putin.. you are NAZI
Western history is littered with tyrants who mass killed innocent people families and children far greater than any modern time would ever imagine. Eventually these tyrants became saints or were honoured with statues and monuments as ultimate patriots. Please someone explain how this is different?
Biden sure checked Putin...
Donbass 8 yeas bombing chieldren by Kiev politic
Russia claimed this to be self defense and hes bombing airports. He isnt even trying to solve this peacefully and just attacked Ukrainin thinking that they wont fight back?
When you are done come over and take out DC chicago detroit sanfransisco  etc.
May GOD enlighten Mr. Putin’s brain 🙏
Where are you NATO ?
It will be quick, and over swiftly
putin stop kill the people
Stop it !We've had enough diseases and wars for the past ten years💔💔💔
Cuantas mentiras
Really don’t get why the free world is putting up with a terrorist. DOWN WITH COMMUNISM
So this proves that NATO is as useless as the U.N. Good to know.
God has made a big mistake of creating man, the most uncultured creature on earth. This war is a testimony for this. Daily morning leaders talk about world peace, and at same time they themselves go in for war. Ultimately innocent people are the victims.
Absolutely insain,now the big war begins, another hitler 😳 starts destroying lifes again ,all it would take is one sniper,but its never this easy, instead we watch everyone suffer who have done nothing, but try to live,its always innocent that get hurt,
This is very upsetting
Like an egg, why all these fires?
Hummmm doesn't seem like much of an attack, one explosion on of this, one of that for a total of 3 things. The joke is on us my fellow westerners.
Prayers To All Ukrainia
All these disasters are caused by western countries ie USA, Germany & UK
Just like Mama always said, you can never trust a fart or a Poot'in.
May Allah almighty protect the innocent people
I understand Ukraine wants to be called Ukraine, and they are fighting for freedom, but I would prefer for Ukraine to be Russia, for that will save us from the maybe world war 3.
This war is insane my heart breaks for Ukraine ppl. Standing by you Ukraine 🇺🇦
And UN also ? 😔 RIP UN
there's no free world, friend
you don't know anything about God
not yet
why they put africa man on BBC? so funny to see
Whatever thoughts justified for this action is an abomination, the rest of the world condemn it
Some people simply respond to physical might. NATO should fortify its borders with Russia and invade Belarus and claim it as a “peacekeeping” mission.
Praying for Ukraine 🙏🙇🙌
It is not good
Keep fighting for your freedom and democracy from the evil communist dictator Putin Vladimir Don’t give up! Everyone around the world are praying for your safety!
Where is Superpower USA 🇺🇸 scared of Putin😂😂😂
When Putin says de-nazify Ukraine he's referring to the US/Europe as Nazis.  I'm shocked people being arrested for protesting, ok sarcasm off.
This is so inhumane.. Lord have mercy.
Seriously in this 21st century where we people especially the leaders need to come to terms on civilised manner using destructive weapons to secure their power shows their weakness not power. My heart goes out for all the innocent ukraine civilians.Lets choose leaders that will meet our needs not put people in chaos.
Why world is like this  human killing human
Although they have done some good work, it is situations like these that make me question the efficacy of, and need for the United Nations. Since their inception, we have had several dozen: wars, mass genocides, territorial conflicts, nuclear buildups, crimes against humanity and human rights abuses. Whatever happened to R2P (right to protect)? Was R2P not established to prevent such events? Condemnation and economics sanctions will not stand in the way of a ruthless dictator who is hellbent on literally invading the Baltic states in order to re-establish the Soviet Union in its entirety.
Putin warns....anyone who gets involved will be dealt with serious consequences... like never b4 in history?  A warning to  western allies..nato n Ukraine! The russians  have taken chenoble ..nuclear plant...world war 3...nuclear warfare may not take place...or may take place!.... whatever the outcome this..war will effect... not just Europe..but will effect world economies...gas n fuel  costs and will effect mankind worldwide!... the western allies ..Nato &  russia.....and mankind worldwide...will face major trials ..tests n tribulations....in the near future...Corona virus may have gone in some parts of the world....many thought we all  going back to normality.?? Indeed..we seen nothing yet! May we be all guided ..May the innocent souls be recompensed with goodness and peace...and may we all change for the better &  strive for the hereafter...as Judgement day..doomsday...day of resurrection. ...is not far away!Indeed.evil..corruption n greed has PREVAILED on the hands n seas...n both innocent n guilty will be recompensed in full!Evil in the west and in the east! And Satan ..n his army are planning with the evil mankind.. ..leading them ASTRAY.. n satan...is trying to lead  as many mankind to the hellfire with him!Do u see the virus? Do u see the unseen? Do u see the evil around us? The evil..corrupt n greedy ones???Who created borders?? Who wants to be the super power of the world?? Whos jealous of each other???Maybe all to blame .Russians..western allies or Ukraine....in some way or another!..Think for a moment...Who's the greatest planner?? Who created this planet...how fast is this planet travelling? Where are we all heading?? Did not greed..evil n corruption prevail in abundance?? God! Allah is in control of everthing! The one and only Lord ..worthy of worship! He is the lord of all creation...and He sees..hears  and He is  lord of the Majestic throne...the  lord of the heavens... He is in full control of this planet earth..everything on it and beyond! & He is  the greatest of planners! He created mankind to test us! & to Him we All... return to be recompensed in full.for all our intentions.. actions n deeds!!!!!! . Indeed...we were told a major war will take place soon.....towards end of time....and if this isn't that war! Then indeed...there...will be a major war soon!Who has nuclear weapons at this specific  moment ? What are putins and Natos... true n real ambitions n intentions??????? May God help n guide us ...and  all those innocent souls and may we be protected from all evil..greed n corruption an may we all be saved from the hellfire!  Ameen
What does this gain Russia in the long term? I can't belive this is a really happening. But also don't want my country to join.
Putin saying they can’t live with Ukraine being a constant threat being so close. So is PUTINS PLAN TAKE OVER UKRAINE AND THEN THE NEXT COUNTRY THAT BOARDERS UKRAINE & so on & SO ON. WHEN WILL IT STOP
Plsss help friend Ukraine
These people dont want to be liberated by anyone. They want to be left alone. But western nations went in two years ago and meddled then provoked the Russians to lose their minds and cross some boundaries that should never be crossed.  Now there's blood required on all sides and the only ones who suffer are the civilians if ever country.
Bombing and killing civilians are unacceptable..God,please help and protect Ukraine.
It is the exact time to send NATO troops in and support Ukraine in full scale.
I wish there was a poke out crying emoji eyes emoji so I can laugh as the eyes bleed
The UN is a corrupt organization.
#peacenotwar 🥺
Why didn’t they have anti tank mines placed in borders. Or at least some sort of obstacle. Russian are just walking in like this is their living room.
This is so sad and terrible . I feel for the people of Ukraine, this has to stop.
What is the different between Ukraine and Russia? They were both killing the innocent people just like Nigeria government . These women and children don’t deserve this at all. We need peace in the world. All power belongs to the only one. JESUS 🙏
Nato ,Usa responsible for this. They force two brother countries to raise arms against each other. US backed on all conflicts In the world .😡
Ukraine needs to declare war on Russia! What Russia has done is nothing less than an act of war!
This guy is nuts.
The flock of birdsScared to deathTheir tiny hearts beating ever so fastWhich way to go?Smoke, fire, noise that breaks their tiniest blood vesselsA nature's perfectionBloodied and smeared
God damn Russians it's just leave Ukraine alone why can't the world just be in peace this fight for Ukraine it's pointless I mean why does Russia even need it
I don't understand why the rest of the world does not go after Putin and topple him. Innocent civilians are getting killed...Biden and many other world leaders are most definitely heartless and useless.
Thank god russians aint like us bombing and drone striking civilians here and there🤣
This is not nice that is horrible why because of power. I feel for the Ukrainian my heart and  prayers are with them  Amen.
Why is Russia doing this shit? Problem now is if other nations butt in they (Russia) will fight them and then its world war
Twitter right now: Russia is a friendly country that want nothing but peace with Ukraine, but the evil NATO and America forced Russia's hand, so Putin literally had no choice but to invade Ukraine and attack innocent civilains. Oh and f*ck Ukraine anyway because Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan blah blah blah
If you or I murder someone it's life in prison. If government murder people it's no ramification.
Sickening to see
Hey hey! Ho Ho! I think it’s time for Biden/Harris to go!!!!!!!
control freaks uk and the stupid ass usa
This is soo sad!!it seems unreal that this could happen in these times.I pray for the people of their country.its extremely horrible!
Putin knows the Ukraine has become a puppet of the US and UK. Nato is on the doorstep of the Motherland building military positions. Missile bases all within striking distance of Russia. Putin warned the west not to taunt him on his doorstep. Russia will not stand for US / UK bullies. The UK US don’t care for the people of the Ukraine, they care only for the raw nuclear material that lies beneath their feet. They’ll not tell ya that on BBC news though. 🇷🇺💪🇷🇺
That really wouldn't change anything. They need help. They're sorely outnumbered and under equipped.
Nice haiku.
Everyone with the same generic 
This would have never happened under trump  - Give a thanks to Biden and DEMOC-RATS
This would have never happened under trump  - Give a thanks to Biden and DEMOC-RATS
How many Civilians has the USA killed in the endless war they wage on small, third world countries, from Vietnam to Afghanistan?!
I'm scared....

My heart is with Russia from Turkey. Stay strong Russia. Our enemy is same. 🇹🇷 🇷🇺
I'm Ukrainian but now I'm stok In Turkey , my family in Ukraine in Kharkov and I can't go to them... I cry and pray  , I don't understand how it's happenings. In  word War 2 our ancestors was fight together with Hitler and now we fight with each other ... Shame 😭 Russian and Ukrainian don't want this world, I don't want my country be destroyed only because Putin don't like our president 😭😭 .. sorry for English ..
civilians should all leave because no one will come to your aid and you will die invain.
Support to Russia ❤️ from india
Smfh Why They Messing With Ukraine They Need To Chill Out Smfh
BBC is a slave to govt cronies. It shows only what west want to show.
Allah save him all Ukraine allah
Putin genocida
😖😖
Could BBC interview some of Ukraine's oligarchs? How are they doing? Are they on the front lines fighting?
Это война политиков. Исключительно. А простые люди - это разменная монета, как обычно, как всегда.
Long live Putin, spiritual hero of new world, destroyer of western lies and propaganda, protector of Sovereign people...Long live Putin destroyer of western reptile demons !
The only thing I see is a communist trying to reform the soviet union, by force if necessary. The main tactic used by communists is to brand anything not within their own ideological bubble as fascist and nazi-driven/influenced.
That's like saying The USA cannot feel safe develop and exist with the itty bitty country of  the Bahamas at our doorstep.  Wow solo Russia will give us an unprecedented response to interference but it cannot feel safe with little old Ukraine which is it?
Saw alot of people leaving, If they are not willing to stay and fight why should we. That wouldnt happen in the usa you would have old grannies walking around with a rifle talking about taking such and such from there cold dead hands. Granted in the USA every citizen would be locked and loaded with zero assistance from the gov
Putin is a narcissist and he’s currently in a rage.
The Ukraine didn't invade Russia.
Praying😭
🙏🏽
World war III started, human greed never going to go away.
Lord Jesus save UKRAINE . Amen
Now 22.02.2022 when Putin signed documents and 24.02.22 are more important days than 9/11.2001 in our history.
Russia likes to kill innocent people they need to be wiped out off the earth
Boomers man. Theyre ruining the world with their old and stupid idiologies. Open path for the new ones ans kik the bucket
Exactly how the western world planned it. Your being played by psychopaths
🇷🇺  Putin  claims Ukraine  is threat to Russia,  then why not prove it? But surely  now the world knows whom is the threat, Putin  speaks of Ukraine  as Nazi regime  when Putin invades like Hitler  did with no claim, next he will be claiming every nationality is a Nation of Nazi jews,basically  putin became a psychopath , that everyone  in the world  is his enemy,
president putin please stop the violence 🥺🥺
propoganda from what is really happening
This is a sad day many innocent civs will die but this is what the Biden admin wants who has forgotten that Ukraine has gave millions 2 hunter Biden and who knows how much 2 the Biden admin the Biden admin wants 2 help protect Ukraine borders and not the borders here in the USA why well when both parties got their hands in each other pockets only right u look out 4 the hand that is feeding u  Russia is not attacking a innocent country they r attacking a corrupt nation that has helped the liberal objections of the Biden admin and those under his control hopefully Russia will bring light 2 a tirincal gov here in the USA @ UKRAINE
When will this little dictator of russia be in Hague?
BBC=CABAL ASS KISSERS
Russia and China are controlled by wicked rulers.They are good for nothing.They deserve God's punishment.
PUTIN WILL COME FOR YOU 💯💯💯😭😭😭😭😭
Invasion of Iraq was justified due to the so called ' weapon of mass destruction' Russia now invading Ukraine due to ' security concerns' seems justifiable to me. Conflict of interest fully activated
This war should be stopped now
I bet my life this is Donald trump doing giving putin ideas to piss American off 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 I have a great day and I will be there see you 🎭🎭🎭🎭🎭🎭🎭🎭🎭🎭🎭🎭🎭🎭🎭🎭🎭🎭🎭
loooooool, the communist is coming back☭
The world needs to act now
You sick idiot hell has a place for you
One thing I know. U do not bring suctions to a fight with AK47 missiles and bombs.
there are those with power then there are those... wait there is no one else
The world, indeed, does not balance!This same world was utterly quiet when Gaddafi and his Libya was attacked and destroyed forever for absolutely no wrong done! And this same world continues to be loudly quiet when other countries are going through worst of this as we speak.But as they say, 
Russia and China the new world power. period...
Russia 🇷🇺 please save the drama for AmeriKKKa..........
Mr. Putin, I used to admire you as a sensible leader but this is unacceptable. Declaring war and invading a free country in this day and age! Fuck you!
Putin is a despicable tyrant
it was the slowest invasion I seen in history Incalled his bluff I was suprised they actually invaded after months of talk
Good job Russia. Let this world be ruled by a strong hand, I’m f’king disgusted by all these weaklings caused by feminism and so called female empowerment
Biden is an idiot, this his fault
I wish Americans would step in for Ukrainian people. I know Biden is a very weak man he is. But I will stand up for, what Biden does, he is or persistent I take respect of Biden, we all should right now because we are dealing with a different situation. GOD BLESS UKRAINE
137 soul's died today in Ukraine  because America won't open it's own oil pipeline
Why? Why attack people your nations's population is basically equal too? We all just got thru COVID, why create needless bloodshed? How idiotic can you get?

Ukraine shouldn't allow their young men to run to another country, they should should make them exit the vehicles and give them a Rifle and vest, and helmet.
Zelensky is too naive and are barking at the wrong door. Be like Afghans, they defeated Russia, the US, and NATO.
War is not the answer
LETS GO RUSSIA
Russia and China vs The world…Quite the scary thing to think about.
The 
i just prey they all wear go pros so we have good content
I don't believe a word that Msm says anymore, not after covid.   Pushing a narrative like normal.
Putin is a thief that’s why he is afraid of being stopped from robing the Ukrainians of their countryThe Devil takes things by force as Putin does
This is war inside Russia not other countries.
it's Unforgivable
Watch those Russianß
Good time to buy in that country
Pray for ukraina...One day Putin will accompany Adolf Hitler in hell
My heart is totally broken in pieces. Feeling extremely sad prayers for Ukraine 😭😭😭🙏 may Allah bless u all stay strong...we want peace and justice 🙏 love from Pakistan
Where is USA ...coward*5???
Praying for the innocent children and individuals in Ukraine 🇺🇦 🙏🏾 😔 😢 😪 ❤  this is very sad the world 🌎 should stand against this ‼️💯
Трусливая Европа и Америка обманули украину.оставили один на один с русскими.ничего после Украины Путин всю Европу захватит за пару дней.
Stop lying Putin ! How can you sleep at night with all these innocent people affected by your lies, greed and selfishness?
Afghans defeated Russia with U.S. military assistance. Afghans defeated the U.S. because of the spineless politicians we have in the U.S., specifically the Democrats.
 @Kurt M.  You make good point. Who do you have in the US now? 
They have the numbers but not the war machine of the superpowers
why are you so sad?  less than 200 ukrainians have died - how many Iraqi's did America murder in the fake war?  I fully support Russia.
Some say something,some stand up please.some one stop this demon...
This would probably not have started if Trump were in office.Very sad indeed !
To me, Russia really dont want an invasion to most of Ukraine(just want near border), but it seems Nato makes them make it happen.
This is a bunch of crap. You're not even getting half the truth from this extremely biased so called news.
Can we stop with the nazi comparisons for everything.
This whole thing is so fishy, I don't believe either side of this conflict. It seems like both are full of BS. May the chips fall where they may.
But what west has done about it ???? Except saying we will cripple russia's economy
Russia should realise that war doesn't bring peace
at 01.09 FAKE ..there is no demolition by missles or such thing...BBC show FAKE NEWS it sould be fire marks and splinter from bombs or what hit that place...but that is simply a abandoned bulding in decay SHAME BBC
First is was saddam Hussein, then osama bin laden , then COVID , AND NOW PUTIN!!!! . All we need next is for an alien invasion of planet earth 🤦‍♂️ to top it off
All countries should stop this war... between two countries .normal people are getting suffer.
Russia battle royale in real life
I prayed to God please save the innocent people, this is not what we wanted, where is Peace and Freedom?
Russian civilians and American civilians don’t want this war. Goes to show that we have no power in our own nations. when will we rise up to stop these corrupt politicians and governors they decide our freedom for us and we have no say why would I have to fight a war that these people created fight your own wars and leave the people out of it
All Amma do is watch
Pray for Ukraine :((( They won't step into NATO but it's too late.
God save the Ukrainian people.
Dictatorship..  Putin will get back what he has done with Ukraine.
Now Ukraine must have realised the effect of its hobnobbing with USA & NATO.One shouldn't antagonise a powerful neighbourer.USA wouldn't step in physically as it got a bloody nose in Korea, Vietnam & Afghanistan.A not so wise leadership in Ukraine.
whats the full truth of it?
 @Tasmanian Tiger Grrr  America lies and get Ukraine to join an anti Russian group, then the same country that wants to get rid of aRussia places troops at the borders, the news passes it off as not a threat to Russia.
Which isn't much of a threat, considering how all out money is fiat currency with no real value
Russia wont occupy your country , Russia is back yo take its nuclear bombs left after soviets collapsed and to destroy your military forces .
Ну что европейцы и американцы,испугались? Продолжайте на словах поддерживать украину.европейцы и американцы трусы.
The entire world, even some Russian civilians: This is horrible, this needs to stop.Trump: Putin is a genius and savvy for his actions in Ukraine.Incredible how an American President is praising Putin despite America and Russia being enemies.
What did you think would happen with American and European agents helping right wing anti Russian groups topple the democratically elected government of Ukraine in 2014. Were you crying  about the lose of democracy than? This new Government than close Russia speaking tv stations and Russian news papers and banned speaking Russian. Closed the Russian churches. Why were you not crying about human rights then? There is a word for this behavior and a culture last seen in ww2. Why did you look the other way? Are you stock and surprised that Russian speaking areas of the country wanted no part of this illegal government? You call them rebels and surround them with armies in the Donbass. Try to invade them twice and shell them for eight years is this really your 
Why isn’t uk helping ukraine?
😭bad
Severe earthquake for Russian
The strange thing is that Palestine has not paid attention these few years??
Sign me up Ready to goFk Russia
I feel annoyed when bad people claim 
WW3 incoming. Putin is a narcissistic psychopath.
Imagine this being in America all the leftist would blame racism some how
No war please , stand with Ukrain 🙏
Putin will soon be riding his horse around Ukraine with no shirt on flexing. Just wait for China. Biden who? Nooo business
Trump was right.
Russia is crazy!! They are bombing and killing innocent people!! Russia needs to be stopped immediately
I hate this. Whst the fuck is going on in the world 🌎 😒
НАГНУТЬ АМЕРИКУ НАС СТАЛКИВАЮТ ЛБАМИ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3C2z7L16No&t=37s
My prays with Ukraine!! War needs to stop!! The peoples voice should be honored!! The population should be able vote on if they want to be part of Russia!! Democracy  gives people a voice!! The majority of the people should choose their path!! Sooooo sad!!
If the government of Ukraine and NATO would have allowed the 2 provinces that wanted to join Russia secede as per the agreement made 7 years ago, none of this would be happening.
ypa comrade, 🇬🇧❤️🇷🇺from Leicestershire
You Nazi!!
Wrong! You don't give in to a bully. They'll just want more. Why couldn't those in the two provinces that didn't want to live under the Ukraine go back to Russia?
NATO forces need to take to the air and remove any and all Russian planes and and rockets out of the air. The world is waiting to see what America will do this would never have happened under trump.
Imao, NATO dismembered Yugoslavia in last century, so Russia invaded Ukraine it's not strange thing. The world is like this. War can never stop, whether US and Russia exist or not.
Some prophets talked about this last year,they foresaw it
Fuck Russia
Don’t believe the media!
It's troubling that so many people buy into the media propaganda machine. If all you're going to offer are 'thoughts' and 'prayers', then at least let your thoughts comprehend what is happening.The Obama administration exploited the civil war in Ukraine with a hard push to join NATO. Ukraine has been a neutral zone between NATO and Russia and this was an attempt by the West to abolish that neutrality and have influence there. If this were to succeed then it would be like Mexico agreeing to give China influence in their country... that borders the U.S. The U.S. would not tolerate that anymore than Russia would tolerate NATO in Ukraine.rrPutin never wanted Ukraine, but if he can wreck it before they join NATO, then he has reduced the ongoing threat that has been present for the last 7+ years.  This doesn't mean that Putin isn't a thug masquerading as a president, he is. But his thug-attributes are not the cause of this, they only rule his solution to this.rrBut to be fair, Putin did seek a non-violent solution early on that would see Ukraine retain their sovereignty (as conflicted as it is). And guess who apposed that solution: It was NATO because they want(ed) influence there. So think about that for a minute. Putin, known to be a thug, early on suggested a non-violent solution, that was apposed by NATO. The same thing happened with Georgia, so it was sacked before it could happen.rrIt's an extremely simple tactic: If you cannot prevent your enemy from taking influence, then destroy the thing that would give them influence.
Because of these stupid leaders who suffer the most- the common people. The US has no less blood on its hands. In the name of NATO, they just want to spread their military camps all over the world. Ukraine's leader and everyone in Europe are just a puppet of the US. They don't have the balls to say No. Russia had to do this because they cant have their rivals military bases looming all around them. So what's the only way, keeping Ukraine under Russia. And Russia doesn't give a damn about the sanctions- they have China. But again who suffers the most because of these politics- regular people like us.
🇷🇺💪
USA AND WEST BETRAYED UKRAINE
Bullying😮
Putin got a special place in hell that's for sure. God help those poor people. Could you imagine what they're going through? Absolutely horrible. Smh.
Fake news
Ww3 begins
U presedent of Ukraine u must talk Putin because u r russian too I think u mast do so
my heart melting thinking those children, wemen, and other innocent poeple who affected in this war. I hate war......Putin is a new era of Hitler.....a demon leader, this kind of leader should burn in hell
I still think what Putin is doing is BS, regardless of what might have happened in the past.
THIS GOUVERNEMENT IN UKRAINIEN IS ILEGAL AND IT KILL MANY PEOPLE THIS PRESIDENT IS ILEGAL AND IS A CRIMINAL
Civilians are the ones that get hurt the most
this is horrible. maybe this is what Palestinian feels when Israel and us attack them.
good job russia. take out all the commonwealth leaders to. especially Biden and jacinda adern
Just think, this may be the end of the third planet from the sun. Been quite a ride, but maybe we didn’t deserve it. Too many crazies with nukes who won’t live and let live.
Whenever war strikes..It's the civilians who suffer..
Putin is now a bullet magnet...
Mexico 🇲🇽 is with you Ukraine ❤️

Zionists may be trying to leave by air
Thank you Mr. Putin for protection of  civilians and stoping insane ukrainian politics. Respect to you!
God not sleeping God will always open away for his people I pray for everyone safety 🙏
Butt who Vladimir Putin THINK HE is to do what he did to UKRÁNE. He of to pay. For what he hás Don.
This should be the end of Putin. Russia stand up!
World war2 was bad I felt so bad for Americans that lost there lives again to help other country's against Germany
This is so uncalled for. This man is heartless and just pure evil. My heart goes out to the people of Ukraine.
gosh!!!🤦🏻
That act of war and finally a real war last one was Vietnam war im ready to honoring our generation of warrior
No no no not the civilieans russiaaaaaaaa
Imagine seeing planes bomb buildings in America.  It sounds impossible.   Crazy poor Ukraine
Not even Korea is interrupting the partial peace after this pandemic...fuck Putin generation..he should be delivered
Mexico for Ukraine!
U r f evil,shut up!!!
He is just another Hitler on the rise, And NEEDS to be taken out!!  The US Has to step in with the REST of the WORLD To stop this!  And DO IT NOW!     Everyone Needs to know,  This is the start to world war 3!   So please start stocking up on supply's for  your family's now!   Welcome To World War 3!
 @IGotzPotatoAim  bot
 @IGotzPotatoAim  Putin is definitely aiming to be the second Hitler. But no, keep the US out of this, you idiot. When two superpowers with nuclear power fight, we will have nothing left.
The U.S goverment should be the next target! Biggest terrorist goverment there is.
 @Ese Miklo  nahh man keep us out it’s just the leaders us people don’t want this shit
 @Ese Miklo  lol. Putin is crazy, not stupid. Russia doesn’t have the money, technology or military experience to wage war on the USA. US been fighting wars for a long time,
Why is the United nations allowing this?
Украинцы забздели русских
And everything goes according to the plan of usa. states made a plan to start a war near the border of Russia in order to expose new sanctions on Russia and to take control over gas market to start to sell american gas instead of Russian. My opinion is that the war started because of usa. Like many other wars: Lybia, Irak, Syria. ukrainians say thanks to uncle sam, now you can immigrate as you wished
LES GO RUSSIA, HELL YEAH BROTHER
Putin is going to bring the whole world into a nuclear war.
This is what happens when the U.S. tries to push the boundaries of NATO not upholding the Minsk agreement.
This  is sign of world war 3.
Putin has marked russia as just another terrorist civilization,  remember  when Sadam attacked Saudi  ? What happened  to Iraq  afterwards?Putin is just another  SadamRussia using nukes as threats is not a serious nor significant  strategy  to accomplish  his claim but rather the opposite that proves Putin is on his own personal  Madness mission,  The joke of all this is Putin to even believe that Russia  ever actually  held an impire, he was not even born.  only after world War 2  did Russia  show any wealth along with joint venture between  the 3 leaders 🇺🇸 🇬🇧  Russia. countries that defeated  world German control,  putin has his history confused , he knows nothing  of Nazis and whom actually  created  the SS
Prayers and thoughts to all the innocent people
Nato could back off at first place now Ukrainians suffering
I say we put ww3 to the test
NATO was playing hide and seek with Russia and Russia just stood up and showed itself. NATO doesn't know how to paly anymore...they are dumbfounded.. ha ha.. Checkmate.. measure your adversary before play with them..!!
This is terrible hope and prays for the civilian for the priority first.
There's one leader in this world with balls his name is Putin
Now Russia is hitting civilian targets
You mean eastern Russia…fuvking dumbasses
sadly, Russia will be taking Over Ukraine and there is nothing anyone is going to do about it...Putin knows now is the time, no country is willing to fight w/ Ukraine at this point.  Yes, they Russia will get hit w/ many sanctions but this is of no surprise to Putin for i am quite sure he planned this out long ago.  There is no way Putin is going to allow Ukraine to be apart of the EU or NATO so time too strike is now.  There is only one way too stop Russia and that would be for other countries to bring in their military.  Well Putin is betting that they won't.
I don't know anything about the Minsk agreement, but the fact that the Ukraine was trying to repel separatist military action says you don't know what you're talking about or you're lying or being a troll.
 @Kurt M.  google and read the Minsk agreement
who freaking egged russia on?
Putin..Duck..if you can...

US citizen here, never ever would I wish harm on any human or living thing... Know there are more of us good souls here watching and crying for this world right now
I bet every person from America that shits on America are biting their tongue nowadays
Putin is not going to stop ..he is unleashing hell on earth...did you know that ,some years back, he ,on camera ..had his long time wife whisked away( she had just picked their son up from school..or something ...anyway, he liked some Russian news anchorwoman ..so he had his body guards ,literally haul his wife away ..and he thrust whatever 
Long live Mother Russia ❤️🇷🇺
War is peace, truth is lies https://youtu.be/etaCad3gJa4
Praying for Ukraine Putin is evil.
Be careful on what we are believing. We are not in those countries and do not really know what happened.Just look at our news network reporting half truth or lies against opposing parties.Also, look at what we did to Iraq.
I hope we in the US assure our allies in NATO that we'll supply whatever they need to help the Ukrainians.
He used to weigh over 300 pounds and was sick and tired of being sick and tired.
I remember US doing this to my country of Serbia.... I was there it was horrible...i was 12
The Russians are so kind, when NATO bombed Belgrade, CNN couldn't safely report on the street
If Ukraine joins NATO then USA will have the authorities to put their weapons in Ukraine and that will threatens Russia national security. Be smart people this would not happen if Ukraine insists on joining NATO and USA does not interfere
Once Putin is gone, his dream of another Soviet Union will diminish unless the next person in power also has his same idea
Every serving of Organic Hemp Seed Oil brings a delicious nutty flavor and 12 grams of Omegas 3 & 6 to any meal.
Too sad seeing civilians being killed. Because We have experiencing it in Afghanistan since 2001. 😭😭 My condolence to the martyrs family 🇺🇦
People need to realize this will eventually be a world war and many countries will be in the same situation if this keep happening. Russia will do anything if people try to get involved and I believe it because Putin is fucked in the brain.
God bless Ukraine!🇺🇦✊🇰🇿
Biden and NATO should have put troops on the line to stop anything and none of this would happen.  Now we mourn those innocent who lost their lives.  I pray the people of Ukraine find shelter and God be with them through this
what in the world are you saying?

Same thing happened in Libya when NATO and USA attacked Libya back in 2011
Watch full  new Invasion videos from Northern by Russian
UN is just a show piece! They only act when their boss China orders.
VLADIMIR PUTIN. IS a profesional liyer
NATO do nothing，just watching
WHERE IS NATO?? WHERE IS THE UN??? WHERE IS THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY?? WHY LET THIS HAPPENED??????? SADDENED FOR The Lives OF the INNOCENT
I'm not a fan of war, but I believe aggression needs to be stopped with aggression. As a Vet, i believe Nato should take swift and necessary action against Putin. Sanctions are not going to stop him, and this is playing out much like WWII where we didn't want to get involved until way too many people died. My heart goes out to the people of Ukraine
Let's be honest.  Americans really don't care.  They will say prayers.
that is ok. Russian army only protects citizens of Russia that where killed by ukranian terrorists and radicals. Everything is fair
Putin has taken notes from the west. Claiming self defense, his country is only defending itself....without any evidence.  Of course the weak minded among us will believe him and support his demented actions.
Just as Trump was derailed so should Putin be put-in a hole and covered up.
Om nama shivaya
Really really sad

So rightly this Russian woman says - this is Putin Biden war. This is not our war.
Previously US was provoking the War and offering support to Ukraine, but now Ukraine knows that the support from US GB NATO and EU just a joke. Ukraine should fight Russian alone....
NATO probably send that rocket so they can get the World attention . this what they did in Kosovo they bombarded Kosovo so they can blame the Serbs and get world attention. This what NATO do and the West they control the MEDIA . NATO is the AGGRESSORS and not Russia. Greetings from LAS Vegas
Nuke Russia. Fxxk them.
I am surprised the USA wants no part of this. Generally, they love sending troops to other countries the chance they get.
NATO and the US are useless and literally idiots, they say they are not helping Ukraine to counter the invasion...
#PHstand4Ru
To the American supporter : 
the world had weeks/months to respond to their request of Ukraine not joining NATO. They were ignored/sanctioned rather than being heard. Not like this happened from day 1, they waited for 
😢😭
Following the events of 02/24/2022, where Russia declared war on Ukraine.rThe time has come to stop pondering, warning or arranging meetings and summits, countries whose values for freedom and governmental autonomy resulting from free elections by their peoples, unite.rUnited in more than passive spectators, but united in concrete actions.rNot in sanctions that in no way affect those in power, but instead, punish people subjugated to violent regimes that oppress them. Sanctions that are used to create more discontent in these people and made into political weapons to justify and gain support among the population, for the acts of countries that offend and aim to take the freedom of others.rrIgnoring these events will mark the beginning of the decline of freedom between people, as it is seen as a sign of the fragility of those who succumb to threats and provocations.rFor each country that falls under the power of dictatorships and totalitarian regimes, the balance is tipped towards a total loss of freedom, if today we let a country fall, tomorrow it could be a neighbour, and then ourselves. The day when even all of us together we will no longer be able to defend ourselves comes closer and closer if we decide that it is someone else's problem...rrPraying doesn't help, its soldiers on the ground, tanks and weapons that are invading. Only actions can stop what may one day be the loss of all freedom. Not today not for you but some day, for your children or their children.rWhat can you do then?rSpeak up, spread the feeling and information of what is happening. Don't hide or muffle by pretending nothing is going on.rHere are contacts to make your voice heard around your government. One person doesn't change the world, but a population can move mountains.rrPortugalrhttps://www.portugal.gov.pt/pt/gc21/primeiro-ministro/contactosrU.K.rhttps://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/offices/commons/house-of-commons-enquiries-service/contact-us/rFrancerhttps://www.gouvernement.fr/contact/haut-commissariat-au-planrU.S.A.rhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/contact/rrIt is not lightly that I write these words, but silence is consent.
Because you prefer to be the puppet of the UK and US and other slaving countries. You will thank Putin in the end.
UKRAINIAN PEOPLE SHOULD COME TO AUSTRALIA!

Wow look at them defending the “independent republics” in east Ukraine all the way in west Ukraine!
Do people actually still listen to the BBC... I mean they're completely full of shit
AMERICANS KNOW YOU DEMACRATS ARE INVOLVED U WILL HAVE NO WERE TO HIDE .
Looks like Russia has learned how to defend itself by looking at America and Brittan.
Putin, you don't have to do this
Russia call bluffs.
The Ukrainian prime minister is causing a break down of national security of Europe - they want to join NATO and now Russia feels threaten, causing regional instability of Europe to fall, the people of Ukraine dont need this, Russia wants to defend itself from NATO aggression so what do you expect, those guys needs to go... Ukraine needs to prosper with out all this.
Y REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE OTAN SHOULD BE RESPOND THIS STACK THEY ARE STRONI THEN RUSSIA.
WORLDWIDE PROTEST AGAINST PUTIN

All thanks to the U.S.
Ukraine is stupid enough to be used by the US and Western countries to contain Russia by all means.  The US creates chaos and wars regardless millions of life lost for their wealth and agendas.  The US also wants to contain China by all means.  The US has lost their dignity and they must be charged with war crimes for all the wars they'd created throughout history.  Russia must fight back against the US and Western countries aggressions.
AFTER PLAY GOD AROUND THE WORLD ,AMERICA WAS ONLY COUNTRY LEFT FOR U TO DISTROY .U THINK YOU AND YOUR FAMILYS ARE UNTOUCHABLE .HA.HA.HA.

May God be with you 🙏
Lord 🥺🙏
Dearest People of Russia 🇷🇺 please hear me out.  Only you can stop Putin from committing such crime!!   Only you can stand up to him and tell him enough is enough!   It’s a fact that Putin is more afraid of his own people more than anything or anyone else.  Listen to your hearts, your conscience and look at your families.  We are all united!  We are all brothers and sisters!  No one wants a war.   The whole entire world is tired of Putins violence and destruction.  Please listen to your hearts and fight for unity, peace and love!  Demonstrate in your own country, on the streets, your homes, media, radio, and don’t be afraid and speak up.  Use your voice to be heard and fight for justice and peace!   Your brothers and sisters in Ukraine deserve to live in peace and be treated with kindness!   Remember that war destroys everything and separates families and loved ones eternally.  None of us should have to live under the oppression and fear!
oh no world war 3 coming soon
I live in the US but am Ukrainian and pray for all Ukrainians for their lives and protection. War just leads to death. Let's make Peace Mr. Putin. I implore you Mr. Putin.
THIS IS BIDEN AND THIS WEAK ADMINISTRATIONS FAULT FOR LETTING RUSSIA BECOME SO POWERFUL AND OUT OF CONTROL. OPEN UP OUR PIPELINES AND STOP BUYING OIL FROM RUSSIA AND CHINA.
War is a lie 💀 from the devil. 👺
All nato countries need to show up with all their planes ships tanks and men or the USA needs to stay out of it
If these Cowards  are brave enough ,Why not try North Korea even though nobody deserves this?My light and Love goes to Ukrainian People🤩
War is not a solution.It is nothing but destruction. UN has to do something to stop the war before it is too late.
This is just gross💔
I can't stand by this brutality from the Russians side
you don't know what you're asking for
not just Putin
it's all in the scriptures
Sometimes war is necessary. Russia needs to be stopped or they may be emboldened to do more.
you aren't serious, are you?
un is show. please seriously consider joining the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
who provoked Putin?
 @Остап Сулейман  This is why Russia is in the threatening side. Does provoking means war????
We all knew this was going to happens.  Its  an extension of what started under Obama as he helped Russia invade Crimea.
baru kau merasakan peperangan kan, lihatlah palestine sepanjang hidup peperangan
Forgotten to mention, thought, that it was a military one, with NATO's bombardment equipment. Go to HELL, NATO!
I just saw another country invade another country in my lifetime
How about the civilians?  😔
GOOD JOB DEMACRATS U JUST STARTED WORLD WAR 3 FOR BRIBES AND POWER .THE BLOOD IS ON BIDEN ,OBAMA ,AND PELOSI, nd harriass HANDS .U TYRANNY ,TREASONEST DEMACRATS AND EVIL CARTEL NANCY PELOSI SHUMMER ALL U.  FUCKS WILL BE FIRST TO.DIE
💔
He is defending his country.
Russia makes threats to anyone who interferes. But what happens when the world comes for you?
I'm not sure if Russia if right or wrong specialy I don't know what root of cause of their war ,, but like what he said as I remember to pope after visiting Vatican he said he will destroy illuminati..  I don't know if this is his part of his plan..    keep safe Ukrainians folks stay safe 😢
This happened to Serbia 20 years ago when USA bomber Serbia civilians.
Death to Russia
This is horrible, a crime to humanity. Ukraine, stay strong. 🇺🇸❤️🇺🇦
Brazil supports Russia for the end of imperialism!
Wow, Russian protesters are getting the Trudeau treatment now?
Omg this is so devastating what the hell is wrong with putin 😢
What does Putin have to prove why why I don't understand 🤔 😕
WW2 America cant be defeated as there is a Rifle behind every blade of grass,  Hoping the Europeans learn from that...
not helped, but provoked
you reap what you sow
Nothing wrong with Putin but everything is wrong with your country, you are messing with the wrong guy.You gonna witness the end of the west including the US
 @Henry Kuppens  wow... sources please
the us is on the path of self-destruction

Russia has the right to take W. Europe because W. Europe legalized same sex marriage, the wrath of God. Ukrainian government must be toppled for making alliance with W. Europe.
The West will support Ukraine until the war breaks out and then the West will withdraw. That's the west tactic. Never trust anyone.
As a American. Putin has my blessing because I would have done the same thing
Where is US and NATO ?
Come on Biden do something
Haha ‚like the nazi occupation‘ - no history awareness!
did Putin develop dementia or something? wtf is this.oh wait, I just remembered he did the exact same thing years ago to Georgia. so he's just an idiot, got it.
Regime change is needed in Ukraine, Long overdue
To be fair NATO expansionism started in ex Yugoslavia in 1999.rThat happened in 24 March 1999 when NATO firstly bombed (FR)Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) WITH OUT UN rrAPPROVAL) , then sent  NATO 
Vladimir Putin is a rat, hope he gets what’s coming to him
this is what happens to a Disarmed population
Putten is a war monger. Killing  innocent civilians. This is bad. We all have to stop this.
if Ukrainian military surrender they would be handing Ukraine to Putin. This is horrible.
Now ukraine has suffer the same fate like Afghanistan just cuz they have been brainwash by the west and us nato ally said they will help ukraine if russia invade now the only thing that they do is only sanction and talk lmao poor ukriane
At least they all seem aware and against it, and not tricked by propaganda like our country Americans be cheering it on until it back fires. War is a shame period. Destroying completely innocent people is abomination.
Okay time to show him our hammer
what fvck are they talking about - self defense?last time i fvckin checked, nobody was bombing anyone, our biggest issue was covid and the taliban before russia did this. such blatant lies and gaslighting - so disgraceful; the rest of the world isn't going to accept this bs.

a bit too late now
you are nuts, brother
Right around the corner filling their pants.
Are you referring to the comment by the Ukrainian or Putin?
 @Kurt M.  Ukrainian. They are history blind.
invalid argument
volunteer with the Ukrainian national guard
 @Остап Сулейман  I would but im disabled and old. But I do know how to shoot.
Propaganda
how many Country USA and NATO destroy already ....nobody talk abbot this
The Ukrainian army was poorly equipped and trained and quickly surrendered. Shame on the West - especially Germany.
Ya Allah protect innocent people more especially children, mothers and old people 😭
Putini is this generation's Hitler
Stop war.
This is not what they show on rt. And they show real videos in HD not in 240pixel
Good video, but you need to consider that you might be helping Russia by posting this, every information is of value at this point
trump and putin, put them both on a one way flight into the sun
When are western societies gonna realize that Russia and China's words are empty. They intentionally lie to appease and buy time to carry out their plans
im sure europe will do the responsible thing and take care of it before the usa has to clean up their mess.  oh wait...
Funny.... looks like just another day in the city!!! no panic, no bombs, nothing!!! wtf? more fake news???? cant believe anything they put here!!!! have a great day yall!!!
This is why US should stop getting involved 🤧
No more war
Will the world just stand by watching?Do something to restore peace or do something to stop authoritarian Hitler like dictator
Призываем к казни слишком короткого сына Сталинской проститутки!!!
Drop nukes on Moscow.
This is what Ukraine gets for violating the Treaty they had and listenign to NATO and USA. Now they just watch and Putin takes control. Putin had not option but to enter Ukraine.
War is so pointless, people can be so greedy and evil. It’s hard to believe we live in a world where all these terrible things happen. And we don’t learn. We will be our own demise.
Putin is a big coward and cannot keep his words, disgusting for a leader...
seriously. please at least consider joining the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
what?!
 @Остап Сулейман  Hello - tanks are already entering Kyiv! There has been NO resistance! The Ukrainian army has not stopped the invasion. Open yr eyes!
Go Russia. Ukraine will be better with Putin in control. One of the poorest country in Europe will be great soon!
My heart is broken for these people.
It's all theater.  Don't believe this nonsense.
The Ukrainian people look calm and willing to become russians
I won’t believe this until I’ve seen it on a credible news source….so definitely not here then.
Where the fuck is USA now?Biden was like:
Russia🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Biden is the reason why there is this invasion . Ask Biden madafuckers. His evil
God save Ukraine 🇺🇦🙏🏽
UN what now?
Like nato did
Putin, like his buddy Trump.... Gaslighter in chief.
BBC : the mouthpiece of Western dirty politics. Why did nato try expanding reach to Ukraine? Russia has been warning since last one decade. Why provoke it and now claim victimhood.Russia or former soviet aren't known to be kind. Ww2 was fought hard by Russians but Churchill took credit. Typical British duplicity and self bravado. Heck the brits never acknowledged the million Indians that fought its dirty war. War mongering expansionist west.
Is it right to threaten innocent civilians? What does Russia do this terrible thing for? Bear calm down
the woke weaklings are useless..Smash heads
Who give him that scrip the demonrats
Thanks Joe
My lord help the people in this kind of problem
We are gonna end up wiping Russia off the map
Praying for Ukraine 😔
Ukraine people seeing so calm no chaos, Ukraine people are in danger, but they look so normal like nothing happen, they say they scared? Don’t see any of their faces. That is so weird
Please pray for all of them.Pray for peace
It reminds me of the time when US started invading Iraq. Poor people. May God destroy Russia and US.
Is this the start of WW3
I can't believe no one is steping in to stop this.
THE MOST HIGH BLESSINGS: Again, another reason proving, GOD FUCK BATTY AND DI DEVIL IS LESBIAN. And, GOD battyman son was crucified because he sucked cock and fuck batty. No LIE. ONLY YAHWAH TZABHAOATH ELOHIM SAVES. LIVE PEACEFUL FROM WITHIN.
Why
my fan for putin is away
praying for Ukraine people.😭
The Ukrainians don't need nor want our tears. They need FIM-92 stinger hand- held missiles! NOW!
Did the Russian government launch those missiles or did Russian separatist launch those missiles?
Now they gonna blame puti for our inflation lol
IF SENILE BIDEN FAILSALL COUNTRIES NEED NUCLEAR WEAPON TO PROTECT THEMSELVES
Stop 😭😭😭
Bat kailangan pang mangyari to..kawawa naman yong mga innocent people...i cry a lot...masaya manirahan na tahimik and peaceful....from philippines...we pray ...
ukraines army will fall
“This is all in self-defense” as he fires the first shots and starts bombing and missile campaigns. If Russia is so big and bad, how is Ukraine (a fairly under powered country in terms of military) a threat to Russia. What he MEANT to say was that “I can’t have Ukraine join NATO because then our whole border, with the exception of Belarus is NATO and we feel powerless against NATO. Even though NATO has much bigger countries involved and Ukraine itself will add no value to the organization. Basically what I’m saying is we just want to take up more land because I don’t have an valid reason for doing this other than that”.
That's how Hitler invaded Czech. Gave the reason to protect German people, then invaded the whole country.
Time to dissolve the UN...its worthless...Covid...Crimea...Ukraine...Afghanistan...and many more blunders...
Kiev Regime could have solved this years ago,  BUT they chose to ignore the Minsk Agreement ......SO , Kiev Regime chose violence,  instead of a negotiated peace .......There is no one to blame except the Kiev Regime Leaders.  After Ignoring the Minsk Agreement for years  , NOW  , Kiev Regime and their masters in Washington CAN'T stop saying 
What was Russia's 9/11?
 @Junior Adult  Huh? How were 9/11 and Iraq related?
Agreed. I wish there was an international intervention. This invasion needs to be stopped 🚫
I think its because if they did it would officially be a world war. So far its teethering at the edge of a world war. America has always tried to stay out of world wars.. But eventually in the end we reluctantly go in.
I think it's about NATO countries surrounding Russians borders from all sides.
Or that putin just made this shit up as he keep going bechause at the start he just think that he can strong armed ukraine from joining nato only for it to backfired spectacularly and if he backed down after all of that then nobody will take russian threat of invasion seriusly
 @Kasturi Kangkana Saikia  You are correct, this is years in the making since Ukraine has failed to go with either side, both NATO and Russia are cowards and warmongers in this Ukraine is going to have a really rough time don't worry though once Turkey lets US subs and Aircraft Carriers to the Black Sea in a year we'll all be on the same situation.
Do you realize what you just did? You took what Putin actually said added your own false narrative to it then criticized him for what you just made up....You can't possibly be that stupid. I am not taking sides here but I have no problem pointing out stupidity  when I hear it.
So why does NATO needs defense systems across borders with Russia? By some reason, you don't ask this question. The same here with Russia, they have strong concerns and signals (and there is a huge amount of signals) which was made by the US administration and EU who following US decisions. This conflict is not about Ukraine at all — it is about placing military bases of the US with 
Yeap Jordan, it is obvious that it is business. US wants to sell it's gas to europe instead of russian. and there was need for a reason to make europe to stop buying russian gas.
Lol read a history book - you sound like you get your info from tiktok
 @Stephan Clarkson  thank you - finally someone who actually follows history
 @Ghuijy  Kid, what is tiktok?
 @ero  what do you think about Mexico joins pro russian alians. Really funny?
 @Ghuijy  Guffy what is the price for curry in Bangladesh?
Response should have been, 
.... the UN and NATO are failed bodies ! Our countries pay money to support your work in preventing something like this from happening
When their is war their is casualty. No surprise, but why Russia attack them? Why Ukraine don’t surrender?
People need food, healthy environment, education and not war
My heart falls apart seeing these all. After the Covid Situation I predicted the world to get  better that  people would appreciate each other’s but unfortunately it became  opposite way ... the same my heart teared for Afghanistan now is for Ukraine 😞😞😞
Russia never promised anything more bs
One more 
The NATO did this! They causing and initiating the war.  What happen when you got a bear cornered? Bear fight back..
How the fuck did jfk get assassinated but not Putin
This is just lunch hour in the middle east..
Lord please stop the war
I hope the Russian people understand that Ukraine is not building nuclear weapons and that they aren’t “nazis.” That’s the propaganda Putin is spewing on his people.
Democratic tell trudeau to help you if thats the new democracy
Ukrainian are ready to die for Nato..an organisation is not part of ...this is quite interesting . Americans are giving Ukrainian weapons, but watch them from a distance and say
AN ASHKENAZI YIDDISH ROSENBERG AND HIS RAINBOW ZOO SIDE KICKS
Cursed to the one who started the  conflicts at the border. God knows who and be ready to bear the consequences.
the only people in the world that can stop putin in his tracks is the red china army, others can only talk about it as he laughs  😁 vlad would be putin in his pants if Graceful was seized. 🤣rtoooooooooo late, should of destroyed the tanks at the border dumb-bells.  😧make putin one of his famous 007 to die for cocktails...  shaken for good not stirred!
Coward NATO, Coward Europeans and Coward US. So called protectors of the world...couldn't do anything against China when it gave the world Covid...now Couldn't do anything against Russia...if only India was on the wrong side of Russia...they would have seen how to help a friend.
Dude if Russia takes Kiev, it would be like another Russian occupation! Lol. Ps, why is it suddenly spelled kyiv?
CNN FAKE NEWS COMPANY
Regardless of your political affiliation, I cannot tolerate war.
Thats not the russians doing
Everybody gangsta until JESUS Come😆
Heavy jets roaring o ver Illinois.   Sounds like trains roar for mins
Is Putin a Rasputin reincarnated?
World's greatest living war criminal must be put on trial and punished. Policial assasinations, Skripal, downing of MH17, and this list goes on until this maniac is permanently neutralized. God Bless the Ukrainian Army defending Europe from Russian aggression!
Just shows everyone how fragile everything is
SENILE BIDEN SHOULD TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PUNISH THIS RUSSIAN THUGWORLD IS A WITNESS THUG CALLED PUTIN IS EVIL
Announcing the operation, Putin said the mission was aimed at “defending people who for eight years are suffering persecution and genocide by the Kiev regime.”Russia’s defense ministry has, meanwhile, asserted that the operation posed no threat to civilian lives in Ukraine, saying the Ukrainian government had started using staged videos to accuse Russian forces of conducting indiscriminate strikes against civilian targets.
Full support Ukraine. Pray for UKRAINE
Why is he doing this the idiot doesn’t he think we’ve had enough misery without this 🇬🇧🇬🇧
We in Sri Lanka support Russia's victory for Russia ❤ 🇱🇰
This makes me so sad blessings to all the people in danger please pray for everyone🙏🏾
Russia is superpower and no need to involve in war, They have to search for diplomatic solutions. After all wars turns no mans land, innocent people die. There is always tension of neuclear war.
You can actually track this and compare it to previous timelines of similar events from Hitler etc. And deduce that Putin has probably been smoking a lot of weed and thinks he's the reincarnation of some 1940s dictator.
Man I feel so bad just draft me so I can help
Palestine, Syria, Iraq, Lybia : first time?
Mr. Putin stop the war
Just imagine if you were alive during WW1 and WW2
 @Nick  I'm grateful I wasn't friend
It shows that our natural state is destruction rather than construction. One can only wonder which tendency wins out in the end.
 @Nick  todays generation are a far cry from the generation of ww2. As is the media. Indeed todays generation may have misunderstood just how reality works. Hopefully they wake up fast.
 @Highgate Handyman  I think we know how reality works. That's pretty condescending.
 @Mia Mia  I have to agree with you, I really hate how they say that same line over and over. Expecting something to click.
J I Joe You are Fucked up with Putin Hahaha
Is it just me or does anyone else just want putin to spontaneously combust into a bloody mess, no?
im just watching this and i see some helecop in ph
Keeping the corrupt from flying away
Its a joke watching Russia invade a smaller weaker country thinking they are tough....Putin is a joke !
POV : You don't have a reason to blame someone ?DENAZIFICATION Yeah it always works ...

Gotta love putin. F the Nazi west
Like this is the world we live in... where we see evil but can't stop it..
Self defense my ass

W.O. 2 is back again, this time Ukraine will be destroyed by the Russians ,instead of the German army !It’s a crazy well prepared military operation and the result of feeling superior !
Unlike war in mid eastern, you can even go to work and supermarket during the war, no fugitives. Seems like putin only attack their military to make Ukraine know NATO is not an option, and being naked and harmless mean peace to them. Obviously, NATO choose to leave Ukraine to die.
Why ask only to Putin? Ask senille Biden to stop too!
I am from Nepal Fuck you putin stop the war
but doesn't invading ukraine and turning it into russian land by occupation would mean that now russia is literally neighboring the nato adjacently?
People feel horrible but as expected only for one side.
Do not fall for UN and NATO criminal Propaganda media outlets. The USA does not support a war with Russia. Stand Strong America. I know immigrant friends who fled these countries and they support the liberation of Ukrainian by Russia. The citizens of the USA stand United against the United Nations, NATO and their partners. The horrors. The bombings of Ukrainian citizens and invasion and mass slaughter carried out by the UN and NATO is unforgivable. The United States Patriots and Citizens of love and peace stand United with Russia for the Liberation of Ukrainian from Criminal International organizations. The Citizens of USA support the liberation of Canada from The UN and Justin Trudeau. The Citizens of the USA support the liberation of Australia from The UN and Boris Johnson. The Citizens of the USA support the liberation of The United States of America from the UN, Joe Biden, Anthony Fauci, Klaus Swab, George Soros, Bill Gates and their allies. The Battlefield of Good and Evil is laying all of the pieces on the table, and all over the world people are rising up to declare their individual sovereignty and rejection of the United Nations and the World Economic Forums plans for a World Order and Mass Human Depopulation. Together We stand UNITED and join our forces against a common enemy, terrorizing our people across USA, Canada, Europe, Australia, Russia, France, etc. UNITED WE STAND!
Nato is still watching this, u people r just good on talking
The fact that the whole world is able to see this yet all we can do is watch...
We want peace, not war...We want coexistence, not hostility
Russia can just Nuke Ukraine.
Pride before destruction and a haughty spirit before the fall, the Godless heathen western goverments shall learn this divine lesson in spades.
Putin is a coward
Denazifacation? He’s legit using the sjw playbook
All because men's ego instead of working it out they got to take people's lives you ask me that's pretty pathetic
Putin need to go... dictator.....Brandon administration need to go .with trump this will never happen , china watching....
The Russian people should be ashamed they have the largest country and still not anough  puttin is a crook Russian s. Stand up  and deal with the crook HVV
First covid then this
This war is 100% the fault of biden.  Him and his son hunter have been screwing around in Ukraine for years extorting millions of dollars in protection money.  This is what the result is.  Biden and his son hunter have blood on their hands in Ukraine and have destroyed world peace
Ukraine needs to hit/bomb Moscow and/or the Kremlin via a plane strike or missile attack.
BBC reporter's words are farts
denazifi Ukraine??  The government of Ukraine is Jewish... wtf!Canada is now like Russia under Castro's son.
This is going to be WW3. It’s not if its when we join the fight against Russia.
Ukraine should throw their entire military and Air Force directly at Moscow. Then they will need to hunker down for long term urban warfare. Russia will end up having to give up the dictator Putin. Putin is too dangerous.
BBC News .......The Kiev Regime has been shelling civilians and civilian infrastructure for years  , In Donbass ,..........Where have you been to report those incidents  , As usual .  Bias , Unbalanced,  One Sided reporting by another Western Media  Channel
The human race …. We’re lost
The West poked the Russian bear one too many times. I don’t condone Russia’s actions but I understand why they went through with it.
What kind of Floyd mayweather fight is this
Putin wants to be Tsar Vladimir.
Kinda of an eye opener to what it was like when nazis invaded
As pres dumbo and his clueless clan do nothing!!
Words.  Words don't matter here.  Putin won't stop at Ukraine.  NATO will be forced to fight.   But Putin has more to fear from his own people when they realize what he has done.  He will try to use nukes when he is finally backed into a corner.  Deal with it.
🇺🇦🙏✌️
Arresting protesters reminds me of Canada
So Putin lies and invades Ukraine....wow such a big man invades a smaller country...Putin is a coward !
The West condemns Moscow and promises exacting economic sanctions while explicitly ruling out any direct military aid. For anyone unsure how well these tactics work look southwards and see how successful they were in ending the annexation of Crimea...
China, russia 🤬🤬🤬
God protect the inocent people.
This is so frustrating and stressful. My heart goes out to the families there that have nowhere to go. Putin really just screwed himself over by doing this.
Horrible state of affairs when the big bullys the small together with the  casualty of war and its costs
Takeaway...don't trust what the Russians say, although that should be common knowledge. 
Should have surrendered,this is not a war,this is 1 sided massacre.
Two tyrants need to fight each other, and leave the people of Ukraine and Russia alone.
Do you believe what the BBC reporter said?
I’m a American I like Russia but I say we help Ukrainian get their house back
Oh really. Care to explain so 99.9% of the commenters here can understand?
You sound like a idot and if Russia's want to go to war with the United States  then we ain't gonna back down to nobody so Russia better do there homework and realize Americans citizens are ready we have our guns and we got heart bring it and better give it your best shot cause you all gonna get lay down
Putin you are disgusting, shame on Russia!US, Germany, shame on you , all our world politicians have lost there moral values and no shame.
What is the essence of joining the UN or NATO...if the military can't go all out behind the people of Ukraine.....this is barbaric from Vladimir Putin
White vs white so im sitting back with popcorn lmao.
Fake News. Those Columns of Armor are Ukrainian. Not Russian.
I'm praying for Ukraine 🙏
Im sad about this. But what puzzles me is why they never say white on white crime. This surpasses the propaganda they preached so evil about africans in america and other parts. This is 1000 percent more crazy than los Los Angeles or New York. I cant make this up
I guess the world doesn’t give a sh*t what kamilla and Brandon think
Absolutely heartbreaking. I cannot imagine the fear of now living day-to-day with war. Praying for Ukraine. 🙏🏾🇨🇦
This is a horrible
Ukraine is just a proxy for the Saudi-Israeli-USA alliance to bully the petroleum exporter nations into submission such as Iran, Russia and Venezuela. And yes, Ukraine are fascists who welcomed the Wehrmacht in WWII and let them drive unimpeded towards Stalingrad.
Economically  sanction against Vladimir  putins   is  not enough  to scaring putinVladimir putin   must sanction from  spending money  breathing   eating    drinking    speaking
📢UKRAINE FIGHT 2 COUNTRIES RUSSIA AND BELARUS UKRAINE NEED HELP!!!!💪💪
Someone just shelled Russian civilian areas, but I won't say who.
What is going on in this world,how can they be destroying what the Ukrainian has built..why why Look at innocent people been slaughtered ..where is this world heading to,America,Britain the rest of the world can’t you so called presidents of the nations talk to these two presidents especially putin
It's very sad that happens to UkraineBut I wonder How western country and media speeches when USAAttacks other country'sIt's your fault UkrainiensYou believed in world's top cheaters
Pretty damn sad man.  Keeping them in my prayers
God please spread the peace 🕊️ between these two nations ❤️ huminity wants PEACE not HATE 🙏
What is truth?  And who can you actually trust with what is said in these times?🧐🤔🤷🏻‍♀️
WW3!
Hey melle how are you doing today??
Now the Ukrainians know how it feels fleeing war torn countries..The way the behaved towards the refugees of Syria.They deserve everything Russia gives them
Pretty bad idea for Russia to invade a country with a huge surplus of old Soviet weapons lying about. This will be Russia's Northern Ireland. Many Russian sons, brothers, husbands, and fathers will come home in body bags for years and years.
Problem is when two leaders fight, their followers suffer more.
What about the people in Syria Palestine imagine , here it’s a start and people are scare , hope war stop and innocent people stay safe ….. amen
К сожалению слишком мало адекватных людей в России. Надо изолировать эту страну от всего мира. Большая часть населения этой страны, не готова жить в современном мире и в современных реалиях, продолжая жить прошлым и фанатичными идеями, навязывая эти идеи другим странам и угрожая их безопастности.#CloseRF
No actual valid reason Russian government is doing this. This needs to be stopped
I think it’s racist that they sent a blaaaak reporter into a war zone.  He looked absolutely terrified . Only white reporters should be there.  Blaaaaack privilege
“Pray for Ukraine” and hell for communism schooling blood thirsty autocratic ruller Bloodimer Putin and his puppet alliance.
God is coming soon and I pray all see the signs
Ukraine is a western puppet and Russia needs to capture this puppet reigion.
Prayers 🙏 for Ukraine 🇺🇦 ☦❤🇺🇸
putin is a bully
To do this at anytime is barbaric. To do this while COVID is still going on is the work of a sociopath.  Ukraine’s folks are mostly marginalized, they were hit extra hard, as normally they have a hard time getting by, as the gov is so corrupt.  He knew to hit while they are down, so shameful.
Obama overthrew the gov of ukraine in 2014 and set up a chrony system with pelosi, schiff, schummer, bidens, etc children as heads of ukranian corporations to launder and plunder ukranian resources.  Putins kicking them out.   Hopefully putin lets ukraine get on with their own country
P.U.T.I.N. Thinks the rest of human race as stupid as he.  Remember when we r dead we all will be stripped down to spirit n that we all will b =
USA/UK should be held accountable also for this is the result of big Power geopolitics
This might be the spark.  It's seems like the worlds a powder keg and all it needs is that spark.
Yes so you’re deluding your people. Now trying to sell us a narrative, now it cannot be any more obvious.
The problem is not of two leaders,the problem is in the origin,nomads are greedy & liars
Where is the American now who says they will depend ukraine???
Disgusting reason to go to war Zzz
🇺🇦🇷🇺 Should love each other🇺🇦🙏🙏🙏🙏
Shrek
Innocent civilians did not ask for this.
After decades of lies on Afghanistan Iraq Syria Libya, its very hard if not impossible to believe on Western media and analysts anymore!
just like IRAQ & Afghanistan...........
My sister went all the way from Northeast India to Kyiv to further pursue her medical studies. She had only been there for just some time and now this happens. We are trying our best to bring her and the others back home but to no success. I feel what every Ukrainians are going through at this time. My heart goes out for everyone especially for those rescuers risking their lives in orders to save the others. PRAY FOR UKRAINE! 🙏🏻
Please we need to lived in love and unity
I m fire extinguisher kill all all the fire 🔥
Regardless how this conflict plays out, one thing is gauranteed...Putin will win reelection.
He waited until after the Olympics.

This country will be stripped of its resources and the people will be no longer free
If Puttin is not stopped, this very well could lead into a third world war.  My heart goes out to these people.
Dear Ukrainian president……..have you considered leaving????
Leave ukrain alone😞
I hope your sister is able to safely leave the country somehow.
 @Kurt M.  Thank You! We are still trying our best to reach out to them.
Putin evil
Have mercy for the innocent peoples
The sin of Pride
yet putin isnt behind bars for being an accomplice in these pointless murders that involve people that are legit just living normal lives that have nothing to do with their “government business”
Plz Save civilians I'm worry about innocent children and female
Keep up the great job president Putin!!!!  Don’t worry…….Brandon has no testicles
Fu*k america
😆 at the tools still pointing their little fingers at the 🇺🇸. You best point thst finger at yourselves now 😆 😆

I hope this Don't be a reason to start WW3. Because if it's the small country like us full with courrpted politicians will be doom not from war doom from economical disaster currently srilanka in huge economical disaster 😑  like Lebanon low foods supplies, no fule and no electricity for 5-6 hours for day. So if we if ww3 started our leeches politicians will tell beacuse of ww3 srilanka went bankrupt. We need revaluation to stop the politicians in my country but most of people haven't a backbone so we will be doom not from ww3 from corrupted family politicians.
Trump warned Europe about Russia. Yet they laughed in his face.
About ten days ago, the Ukrainian fascists gave clips of training children with wooden rifles, as propaganda about the readiness of the state to defend itself to the last baby, and now we see these guys walking around ...
NATO is the nazi occupation. Just cuz nato did it with military contracts . That's why walmart was trying to hire more people so they wont fall into military. Now as nato rule. Russia steps all nato is at war. It's that simple and that easy. And tell me where is Ukraine army? Why are civilians fighting. Where is Ukraines army? Or did they as Russian decent  walked to mother Russia and turned to the nato as the enamy...
Maybe this will be the war to end all wars!
Damn.. i hope this would stop
So good 🚀💪🤙
Those military age cowards standing around should be picking up weapons and fighting for their country.
Americans surprised that Russia is acting like America
idk why. but putin is giving me hitler vibes. after he takes over Ukraine, he’ll want more
is the narrator drunk? Ukranian president fear to loose his job? The @#$k? He is a hero.
absolutely sickening that completely innocent lives have been taken. why should regular people have to suffer over the squabbles of politicians? pathetic.
Its honestly so heartbreaking to see those innocent citizens get caught in the crossfire of this war.
Biden was poking the bear, the bear responded.
He’s doing it all to piss us off. Become a Ultra Power, and stand in his world.
All military installations were destroyed: warehouses, airfields stuffed with weapons from the west. Uncles Sams tried in vain - razed their good to the ground, thank God !!! Why the panic was raised, no one touches civilians, otherwise where is the evidence, everyone has the opportunity to post a photo if there are dead. But in fact, people are fleeing the country like rats instead of defending it.
Vote out zaleski
wy...why,.,.,,,,wi...... christian orthodox against christian orthodox .......why no  ones pay attention when putin was telling them to compromize and honor the minsk treaty........i thiing i know why.......ex president trump bring down the price of oil so much as to 25 doll a barel...he wanted rusia to be a poor country and he almost make it...to make more money to compesate the lost rusia wants  and start to make another gas line...by selling more gas he can make more money..... but also our oil companies lost lots of money....and now we have to pay for all theyr lost.....105 dollars a barel of oil?......130% up the price of natural gas? .......wy......why......wi....?
Holy moly-
Evil
GO RUSSIAAAA
up yours vlad
Y r they that?
The President you corruptedly accepted is ill equipped
War!!! What is good for absolutely NOTHING!!!!
The hearts of man are depraved. Our soul has a hole that is God shaped that only God can fulfill. Lord God, please watch over the innocent and your children who plead for your protection🙏
Belarus and China's going to be the one that has to get sanctioned not just Russia because Russia doesn't give a s*** and china is aiding it in fundings while Belarus gave them a shortcut to Ukraine.
I feel for Ukraine but I see no US National interest.  Europe needs to step up as Trump told them to 5 years ago.
..NATO pushed it too hard , it backfired.
Don’t listen to western and American 🇺🇸 because they will put you on fire 🔥 then they leave that’s what happened all the  time American don’t care for no body believe me
Why did it end up to this..why is Putin so heartless and selfish
Where is usa and  rest of the saver’s of humanity left the country in middle of war
Russia is killing innocent people that’s it!
Putin is a prick.  His ego is too big and will not back down.
Where is Zilenski? Now?Does anynoe know?
“You no leave now”
Ukraine
European union to weak do nothing for Russia nato and America to weak Russia not scare anything no defense Ukraine countries from West to weak for Russia
Stay safe and stay strong Ukrain.From (🇮🇳 meghalaya)
This is sad. Lord please help them 🙏 😢
U mean how western leader been planning
Joe Biden needs to step aside & ask Trump for help...Putin actually respects Donald Trump!!!
It's really much . Wat the fuck UNO is doing,  Is UNO can only dominate small, weak ndpoor countries.  We all hv to come together for Ukraine 🇺🇦.  They deserve independence nd they hv right to chose right decisions for their country.
Isreal and Russia literally the same.they hurt Thier neighbors
God's  Will
United States always put their nose in another country business and watch it from the side there after shame..
I think the Russia act is a bit more than it shouldn't be
Don't bring a Pen to a Gun fight.  Straight from — Hitlers — playbook: 
Please pray for Ukraine innocent people.  God Please safe guard Ukraine innocent people and give wisdom to Mr Putin , president of Russia..
Man fuck war
8:16 That background whisper that carrys through is a bit weird.
War ,war is stupid and people are stupid and love means nothing in some strange quarters,and I heard them banging on hearts and fingers war!!!.
How many brainwashed in the comments, Russia is the least to blame for this!
They are rolling in with zero resistance??
Everyone’s worried and praying for Ukraine all of a sudden but this has been happening in the Middle East for years! No one was praying and worried for Syria or Palestine but because it’s a Christian country everyone’s worried for the people 👍🏼
2:39 a mustang in Ukraine?? That’s a cool ass dude lol
Russians and Ukrainians arrested for protesting the war is sickening itself. Common ppl lose more in Wars bcuz leaders who want them hide..shameful
Putin sucks
I just remember reading about the start of WWll, they didn’t think it would last very long !I am praying the Lord will intervene but it is written their will be war because God gave us a free will, I pray also for protection for innocent lives 🙏🏻
What is America waiting for, that it is not bombing Russia, like Iraq and Yugoslavia. It has invisible planes and many invisible planes ...
Putin has started believing his own bullshit, but the vast majority of Russians have not. Putin has decided to play Russian Roulette by himself, fool!!!
The West, EU & NATO has been pussyfooting far too long with Russia, propped up this nation through dependence gas & oil. You are equally to be blamed for this carnage.
This so sad but so trueRussia: Me hungryUkraine: No I don't wanna!Nato:Leave them alone or else!America: please, you don't have to do this!Russia:invades Nato: Should we get on they ass?America: ight imma head out Nato: Same
uk sent weapons and a group of cyber experts hackers to ukraine. Right now rt is getting ddosed.
The warmongers must love this.
Fuck Putin. Baby child man who needs to prove himself.
My hope is that this dog and his soldiers get bogged down in a bloody war. Unfortunately Ukrainians will die, but if it means serious damage is inflicted on these Reds, so be it.  Putin regrets the fall of the Soviet Union?  I regretted when we didn't finish these monster off.. The US and NATO should send a message to Russia - let's both lay down out nukes and have it out in a real conventional war..Russia would last a month with a combined US, British, French and German offensive... they wouldn't have the resources to keep up.
Completely different. Was Syria invaded? No. Was Palestine invaded? No.
The book of Revelation talks about a war to end all wars, when Jesus will return with a host to destroy the armies attacking Israel.
This how the devil russian president show his horn and tail by sending bomb to civelian,I hope Nato will strike back, for once and for all there is peace in the world.
Pray for Ukraine! We're witnessing soon-to-be textbook history here. Putin's about to start another World War
World 🌍 with you MY DEAR UKRAINE PEOPLE 🙏JUST HATE bulshit russsia fuck u russsia fuck your culture 🧫Just stop the war otherwise *People will give you a big fuck mind it russsia *
War is never good for anybody
If the power plants get knocked out the lights go out and the scariest place could be in the metro subway tunnels. Especially at night.
are we heading to ww3??
Stoppppp russiia stop doing that many people will affectted about that Just thinkkk..... Why did u doing that 😭😭😭😭Stopppp attack stopppoppp plssss plssssss Many houses Will be destroyed as well as thier live Plsssss stopped!!!!!¡!!!!!!!!Many are already begging Stoopppppo Do yu have a brain ha!
I hate Vladimir Putin so much....Ukraine are in my Prayers.
Αwesome...! 💥💥💥
Prayers to all 🙏🏻😢
Don’t forget the BBC is own and paid for by the government, so research this conflict deeply and more will understand why Russia have invaded
May Putin rot in hell
This is nothing but order out of chaos. Brought to you by the international banker. The media and the United Nations. The action coming to a state near you
Praying  from jamaica 🇯🇲🙏🏻🙌
do not fight ,  itis not the solution to face problems   i feel bad for civilian children and old person   for all the population  in the name ogf God   stop fighting
yes finally i wanted this war to happen LESGOO 😂🤘
Russia is going after Military.  Stop dramatizing this so much!!
USA is the only country that can Invade another country and kill innocent People.
When you talk big game and then when it's real...youre pleading for help.
This is terrible. My heart and prayers go out to all the people of Ukraine. I pray this all comes to an end very quickly.
Lets fight for Mother Russia
China is watching this very closely. If there is no western support to save Ukraine, they will attack the country of Taiwan very soon.
21 century devil (putin)
How do you 
Fuck!  Putin is so wrong in this. It's like he's asking for the western countries to put military/boots on the ground in Ukraine. He wants a war. His reasons aren't good enough to warrant these actions. 😥
Stupid human beings
Like the reporter says the western leaders have been warning for weeks and did nothing to stop it.
nice Belarus  traders.  We are going to have to meet him in on the ground.
Can we stop adds on these news videos?
We need Colonel Alexander Vindman in chargeof the Ukrainian resistance!
His job? How about his life!
Man.. the blatant spin in this... 5 people don't support the war = the entire Russian population doesn't support the war. People in DPK and LPK are going about their lives like normal = they are afraid of Russian occupation. Russia claims the attacks have been targeted, but everybody feels under attack - footage taken in untouched areas, scale of destruction is far less than US 'targeted' attacks in Baghdad.I mean, can your propaganda be a little less obvious, please?
Think off all the Jews Ukraine murdered  in WW 2
This is what happens when you have proud and useless leaders who do not value lives without knowing they will not leave forever
There are images of Ukraine soldiers posing with Nazi flags and Nazi salutes. Explain that you ppl that think invasion makes no sense?
Where's lomachenko when you need him
The Princess Diana die by hom BBC?
We live in an Enlightened Era End WarsThe world is struggling as it is it’s sad human kind is destroying itself once again
Imagine Ukraine go through this and NATO refused to accept em as a member 🤦‍♂️
BBC is fake news
Like the pandemic isn't bad enough, Russian leaders no longer act in favor of their people anymore. This is what happens when you let people with their distorted big egos and delusional ambitions stay in power for too long. My heart goes out to the innocent people of Ukraine and Russia
CANADA ARRESTS MORE PEOPLE, PUTIN IS THE MOST POPULAR PRESIDENT IN MODERN TIMES.
Where does their education go?if they're literate they wouldn't choose war but only subsidise!
The world leaders should fight to the death for what they want they just love huring or killing innocent people Trudeau falls under that group of douche bag dictators too!
Putin has gone mad
Nothing worse than a leader of a Super Power who suffers from Scitzophrinia.
Putin is simply defending russia.America started the Ukraine crisis which would lead to this eventually.America starting wars since 1776 nothing new.
Can anyone imagine the fear and uncertainty Ukrainians are feeling right now?  Imagine this happening in America?  Foreign planes flying over, shooting, bombing.Which all the equipment the U.S. gave Ukraine, not to mention special forces training and Ukraine never resisted it seems from what's said.
NATO BIG JOKE 🤪😂 IM FROM IRAN PERSIA 🇮🇷
My heart is broken :( prayers to Ukraine. The US stands with all of you ❤️
Pooh tin
war is bad. But neither russian nor west are good.. Ukraine should be neutral and not try to join NATO etc. nobody wants enemy on border. West should stop cold war and stop NATO expansion so that worl remains peaceful. Give russia guarantee they won't expand nato and take from them that they won't trouble their neighbours. Keep the Russia neighbours free and peaceful and not mere pawns between Nato and Russia..These small countries are also having humans just.. Don't expand any military alliance as end is always a war no matter who starts and who ends.
i question the BBC , because they have been known to be fake news , we Wan The True not some narrative you want me to believe
UK. Invade.  Argentina.    Remember.
Putin is out to eliminate clear abd visible threat the bio labs in ukerine and piles of NATO arms
The chosen ones.
T- rump Rage Builds in SECRET usa; Pew pew-tin FIRES & BOMBS 3 Days & ROLLS INTO EDGES OF UKR.BORDERS!!! HELPED BY INSIDE PLANTED REBELS; DOMBASA,
Putin got little man syndrome , he needs to be taken out.
All those Russians saying they don't want the war but allow a dictator into power and did nothing to stop it. Like they have never read a history book. Dogs
If us stands it's really good
I'm so sorry for the people of Ukraine 🇺🇦 Thoughts and prayers go out to all of you 💔💖🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
I hope Ukrainian people be safe from Japan.
Good they must obey what the man says ! And stop trying to diss putin
one sided new as always..
Come oonnnnn WW3 put an end to this sorry ass world
I can’t believe putin is doing this
May the peace with two Nations
Gutless spineless all talk no action US UK NATO. Gave high hopes to Ukraine and ran away when big boy stepped out!
Now you go no where.... wow
BBC - JUST LIKE NAZI RADIO OF GERMANY, PUTIN IS RIGHT. CHINA IS RIGHT. THE WEST IS A CIA FRONT
Attacking  civilians  woman's  and child.  He be judged  by God
Made in usa
Natooo vs Jugoslavija 1999... now 2022?
Its command and conquer people.. lets havin a good war.. i want nuke
Putin, Your killing unarmed families and you call that 
If US and NATO gang up Russia then this is opportunity Mujahidin around the world must join in battle to help Russia
The US only good in words but not in action they will only comes when the struggle is almost done as the way they do in my country philippines.
my heart goes to the russian and ukranian civilians. especially the children. omg i cant even imagine. oh Allah please help the civilians🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🥺🥺🥺🥺
Peace !!! Be with you
Ukraine had 8 years to mine with IEDs all invasion roads and bridges, and to put in place the kind of thing Major General Gubbins did with Auxiliary Units as stay behind parties in the event of German invasion of England in 1940.We should now be selecting Ukrainians for training by UK forces in irregular warfare, and when Ukraine is overrun, steadily inserting highly trained and motivated teams to 'spread alarm and despondency' amongst Russian occupation troops.We should reverse the trend of the last 50 years to demonise the training of citizens in Britain in the ability to use firearms, and train our people to resist to the death attack from invaders.A country more interested in which loo people pee in, does not deserve to survive.Our armed forces are laughable, and have been frittered away on stupid wars of the American Empire, leaving us with few troops, and many of those so fat, they barely wobble to war, as ticking politically correct boxes became the Number One Priority.Our system of government has sold us all out to a globalism - World Economic Forum - and is no longer fit to govern.We need a new system, capable of thinking outside of the primitive fear-based box.
Russia just bombing civilians... putin needs to go
Go putin go... THIS IS USA shit and nato....WHO MADE USABOSS OF THE WORLD....AND NOW UKRAINE STANDS ALONE...GAVE UP YOUR NUCLEAR WEAPON FIR WHAT....DOLLORS....STUPIDS
I really hope the likes and good energy get over there and save those people
So many people say “ItS jUsT tHe NeWs TrYiNg To ScArE yOu” but it actually happened.
No war one love to all the people in the world 😭
This is horrible news and bad action. World War III is really near.
Putin is a war criminal
RUSSIA CAN NOT ALLOW NAZIS KILLING RUSSIAN PEOPLE FOR OVER 8 YEARS
putin wants to change the world's political map,Ukraine is just a scapegoat.
Why are they doing that
Were there civilian casualties in Iraq, Lybia, Syria, Vietnam,Afghanistan, Yugoslavia, etc.?🙋‍♂️ Or only in Europe,  when there is a war, there are human casualties?🗽
Self defence my bollocks, he's invading a free and democratic country and he's a greedy DICTATOR who care NOTHING about human life.... HE is the one who needs to go...
Putin is right keep NATO OUT OF UKRAINE. We murdered humans 20 years for communist Israel. TWENTY YEARS ! Biden is a idiot controlled by scumbags who are robbing and destroying America . WHO IS PROTECTING OUR BORDERS AND COUNTRY ? ? ?
Western propaganda, present information one-sidedly.Because of your actions in 2014, this is happening now.
More  people  homeless  Evil Putin
And Biden is asleep 🤣🤣
Sana wala pong manga kabayan dyan kawawa naman
This is sad to watch. Prayers for Ukraine.
Volodymyr, you  look like Hitler. Don't allow your troop to be butcher.
I'm not sure it was different in Afghanistan for us
Nato didn't care about the war protests when they went into countries and killed millions🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
This is not America fight!
Where is the Ukrainian military? Why give Ukrainian, weapons when they don't use it for defense!
How can they win without NATO  support. It's like David vs Goliath!! Wto. I will pray for Ukrainians that peace  will come soon. Sad!!!
what's the point of NATO if nobody is willing to aid Ukraine properly? Ukraine is fighting russia alone
America is the root of evil, it was America who incited Ukraine, and planned hypocrisy against Russia..
Justin Trudeau has a plan to end this.
Evil Evil Evil
Wow, what an ego
Russia is standing up  against the bullying...
Phuck communists, any American on Putin’s side is a traitor
Congratulations NATO innocent women children men elderly is going to die do not wash your hand it will never come out May Allah guide these people PS fuck all the reply and the negative feedback to my comment go fuck yourself I literally mean that because you guys have no idea what a war zone is like for civilians
Thanks for prayers, WE NEED HELP. Close our sky at least!!!
This is the reason why everyone wants to live in the uk. Uk is the most civilised and peaceful country in the world. Russia, Israel, Myanmar, china, Yemen, all murderer rulers, uncivilised, Barbaric countries. War and terror isn't a solution, terror creates terrorism and then they head to the uk to terrorise our innocent civilised nation. Russia has always been a country of murder and war, evil. Just shows how evil and dumb these leaders are.
Praying for the Ukrainian people and also for all the Russian people who oppose this invasion. Wars are started by political leaders, they are the one's who should be risking their lives.
My prayers for Ukraine and its people. It saddens me that it all came to this especially seeing children who have yet to understand the situation. This is so scary as it gives an omnious feeling that this is just the beginning. When it comes to war, it's always the civilians that suffer.
Same like Israel did Palestinians people, now Russia dit also to Ukraine country.... So now US so busy for puting sanction to Russia😂😂 that sanction don't do Biden to Israel even do they kill all children n old people  in Palestine peaple.
Haven't we seen this before in the Middle East and Afghanistan by another Super Power who now have the audacity to decry another despot Nation's attack.
This is pure evil!!!!!!!
Russian is learning well from Israel
DENAZIFICATION ,, SHOULD HAVE HAPPEDED DECADES AGO
Both Putin and Ukranian civilians call eachother nazis. Wtf both are commies
A dictator does it while the world watches that's why we don't deserve to exist.
What ashame that humanity cant get along.
There's a special place in hell for both Putin...and Trump. You cannot do these things and have any semblance of salvation. How dare Putin kill the innocent, repeating the sick histories and tragedies of war, wreaking havoc among the innocent, and threatening safety and security for numerous other countries.
They got one of the videos of snap maps 🤣🤣
They never think what will happen to many children lives,they don't ever care about what will be the result of that attacking..what kind of mind set that god gives to them..
En la conciencia de todos los rusos debe recaer cada gota de sangre derramada de los ucranianos Sostienen a un dictador
NATO must help Ukraine.. because Ukraine wants to join NATO,
Well you guys didn't want to listen to him he gave you guys a chance to respect him And not to threaten his country but you guys didn't listen.
https://youtu.be/L0G9WRRWIuM.https://youtu.be/L0G9WRRWIuM.
Not sure what you mean by the Middle East. Care to give specific examples? As for Afghanistan, the U.S. went in to route those behind the terrorist acts of 9-11.
Whoever didn’t think that Putin was lying was either dumb or blind. You don’t bring 200,000 troops to the border of another country to just look at it.This was not defensive. He’s a new Hitler. Hitler did the same thing. This is the beginning of WWIII.
Why are so many suffering because of some person's greed and beliefs..America and Russia should leave Ukraine alone.
Putin needs to pop a chocky.
oh poor Russia is so threaten..
Assassin Putin the world waits for NATO, USA the necessary help for all those innocent people
War sucks....I hope one day in the future we can live united without borders. There's so much more to this universe, than going to war and killing over a piece of land.
How mentally unstable is Putin? He's getting on in years so maybe his mind is going.
This will show you how important trump was
Biden keeping silent lol
Fuck russia and fuck putin, murderers
Humans are horrible. We are the worst thing to happen to this beautiful Earth.
Que crueldad , siempre las personas inocentes sufren las consecuencias 😔
Скоро будет порядок, стоит лишь подождать
this is getting out of hand
PRESIDENT IN HIS DICTATOR FANTASIES HE WASNT ELECTED--- HE TOOK OVER BY THREAT AND INTIMIDATION.... PRESIDENT...... UP HIS C O M M I E ASS!
US SHOULD MAKE A MOVE THIS IS INHUMANE  NATO SHOULD INTERFERE
謝謝川普同志為臺灣美言（他說：下一個就是臺灣），對那些不自量力的政棍小丑（挑釁俄羅斯說要加入北約..制衡俄羅斯..），雷霆毀滅的懲罰性警告是必要的！為的是對無辜民眾的最好保護...萬歲！我大中華民族偉大復興！萬歲！我大中華中國繁榮昌盛！萬歲！我大中華民族英雄兒女！2022-02-22新加坡華人敬賀
Putin is a monster 👿
Nato is the biggest problem for people they're lies to people  they have killed civilians people in Afghanistan is well but long life to Russia we support Russia 🇷🇺 love ❤
We tired of Wars now you cruel leaders. How do you sleep at night seeing people dying and crying by your hands are you people human??😢 😢
It’s seems that protests in Russia end the same way as they do in Canada…. I do feel sorry for all the people affected by this
1st time US has been punked ..we do not wnat the smoke china and rusia together can bring..the west was trying to corrupt ukraine and make it their military base...thatttt close to russia what the hell was he supposed to do..and please write down all the countries this raagedy ass  us govt has bombed on bullshit accusations...at least putins is real..
why would innocent people suffer from this bullshit leaders?
The Bear vs. The Comedian... my money's on The Bear. The West had a chance to set things right after they caused the problem in 2014. When the Ukraine government refused to ratify the Minsk agreement and treated the ethnic Russians of Eastern Ukraine like targets, they signed their own death warrant. Your lies can't change that, BBC.
When USA went to war in Afghanistan or Iraq or even Syria everyone agree Putin had enough with this shit
🙏🙏🙏🙏🗾🗾⚙️⚙️⚙️
This is the worst yet of 2022. God bless us all
Why do leader has to cause more suffering for his people? I was the product of war child. It was not pleasant. When I see and hear all the gun fires and bombing, it brings back my memory. I pray and hope Mr. Putin consider his actions and make peace for his citizens and the Ukraine. Humanity we need. 👏👏👏👏😢😢
Why? Why are they doing this.
I see what you did there.. Putting a black dude in Ukraine so he can dismiss Putins Nazi claims? Nicely done BBC..
I hope somewhere on the Internet we begin to track how many Russian tanks are destroyed before all this is over. And I hope someone will draw a swastika on Putin’s forehead.
What the h is the correct pronunciation of Kiev? It's annoying.
Unreal to see all the places I used to live under the treath of destruction 😢Nobody wants this war! Not Russia not Ukraine not the rest of the world!Discusting!All about a bored old man, with a 100y old mindset!
Are  the Ukrainians fight back? Where are NATO and American solders?
I wonder how many UK military fireballs occurred in Libya, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, etc ?  Why do I think that the BBC will not tell us ?
What is all this? can we have a moment of peace on this earth please! after 2 years of COVID worries now this, why cant we live in peace.
The prophceys are unfolding, nation will rise against nation
A bit different. 90% of truckers did something for there fellow people and took a risk, took the jab. I work with patients, Covid is a horrible death. You don’t want to die that way.
Mr. Putin considers himself only. That's why he's acting the way he is.
The nazi hates jews not black people
What happen to all the anti-armor missiles they got from all over the world!
Ukraine should be getting Intel from the US so they can position themselves to counter Russian fire better.  God is with you Ukraine!
Americans have to ask, would this happen if President Trump was re-elected?
When NATO was bombing serbia no one cared. Don't fk with Russia, i hope Russia wipes out NATO and anyone that's with NATO
Are we surprised though? Because if Mexico was to the US what the Ukraine is to Russia, we would have attacked decades ago, even after stealing the entirely of the west after warring with them ages ago
I used to like Russia but no more I hate Russia now
If they had nuclear weapons or biological weapons and they have not used them yet, then they most likely do not have them.
I'm wondering if they are manufacturing news again
Senseless war! Innocent people are perishing....this is just heart-breaking.
😞😞😞
Stupid Zelensky the stupid puppet of America and NATO idiots
it's just a fear against a belief and a perception of putin. please just stop!
Where is the rest of eastern Europe?
!!! Putin will not stop because Ukraine is truly part of Russia
Freedom protesters arrested and abused by police....just like Canada 🙄
Damnation for Putin and prayers for Ukrainians.
😪😥😥😥😥
Mexico has launched a civilian assault against the US border. When will we hear more about?
SU 57 in the Air
They need more than intel. They're woefully outnumbered and under equipped.
I actually panicked and thought a world war will happen
Previously, you rejoiced at the murder of Russian children in the Donbass, but now you can cry, we don’t care about you ..
Glory to Putin Glory to the free Donbass, death to the Anglo-Saxons and their servant Zelensky ..
Zelensky has 1.2 billion $ in Costa Rican bank. 2 years ago he didn't have a squat.
The leaders of the RUSSIAN ORTHODOX AND UKRAINIAN ORTHODOX CHURCHES should just condemn this warfare.
It's because Ukraine wants to be part of NATO!!!!!
Someone needs to take Putin out for good Putin need to go
Hmmm
Fuck Russia
It is comical that we have another known killer committing atrocities in the name of politics and yet nothing is done about it. This is somehow an acceptable norm but if an average person were to kill just one person, manhunts, persecution and very lengthy jail time or even the death penalty would ensue.  Don’t the people in whatever country partaking in these orders see this?
Ukraine is at war, thanks to NATO and the west, especially the us and uk. All they have to do is to say that NATO will not expand into Ukraine and there will be no war. The west is provoking the war purposely. See how the us is making tons of money from oil and gas, which stup!d europeans are paying far higher price,  while Ukrainians sacrificed their lives Only dumb will believe the us and uk.
Ukraine has been liberated from the communist EU tyranny, and corruption. We should celebrate.
Devil tries to pass himself off as God, but he's an immitator, God is the Father. Imitated, never replicated. He is the Real Deal.The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up Matthew 11:5Whom the Son sets free is free indeed. John 8:38For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 3:16
This is sad.  Putin stooooooop.
Ridiculous Ukraine 🇺🇦 and Russia 🇷🇺 are not natural enemies, neither people want war,  Ukraine is lawless and not taking car of business for citizens. It’s not a Democratic country by Western Standards, it’s a money laundering spot for political elites and grifters. Putin as any good political Leader will play chess to win. We are back to Cold War reality;  security is still Mutually Assured Destruction modern Nuclear armed world. BBC bangs Putin with Cold War trope’s, they need a bogey man to blame for WW3 and carry water for neocons
Sad to see the Russians arresting protesters like Canada does.
I pray that one day, we can get past the division and borders. A day where we can unite as one race with love and peace. It saddens my heart greatly to know such hatred and fear being driven by our world 
😂😂😂 eso querían, sigan haciéndole caso a Creepy Biden
International support is needed... Right now... We live in such a peace all over the world why now... Putin?? 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
The current Ukrainian government is illegitimate seeing as they overthrew a democratically elected president with EU/US backing yet we’re calling for America to stand up for “democracy” in Ukraine. What a joke. Ukraine government is filled with ex Nazi defectors from germanys invasion in WWII. Ukraine started this war along with NATO manipulating EU
who really wanted the war?
Ukraine might as well surrender and put an end to all this, before Joe sits up and does something stupid to make all this worse.
That will only happen when Jesus returns.
 @Kurt M.  Take charge of your own destiny. Dont wait for something that might not ever happen.
War is a business you know ofc the leaders want this
Ukraine literally started it. The end. Their government needs to step down and be restructured.
Why would you delete my comment about killing Putin???? Guy started war killing innocent people and my comment gets taken down?? Whoever took it down fuck you!
Putin is protecting his borders so when he takes Ukraine and it brings other countries borders closer to Russian held territory will he do as Hitler did and invade those countries as well?
How can any country afford war if they have to compensate for killing innocents? How can a price be put on the life of a child of unknown potential? This is raw violence upon humanity.
A lot of religious nutters praying for Ukraine in the comments section...
i don't understand why a country has to destroy lives in another country when the people who are having issues are only a few of people who are considered leaders. what a waste of energy and lives. so sad...
Never forgive, never forget what NATO did in 1999.History repeats itself.
At this point, Russia rules militarily hands down. It’s happening!
Putin has to go.. he has gone way too far with this and should have left Ukraine alone
western leaders have been warning but doing nothing...
Just skip the political bs and put a hit out on putin and xi, their countries are so centralized and so dependent on them that taking them out will fragmentize their countries enough for capitalists to take over.
Prayers and support with Ukraine! Russia = Terrorist State
It’s not our war
Putin is a mad man he must be stopped, he is the modern day hitler
Hopefully this doesn’t end up as ww3 🙏🏽
:(
The USA should stop cold war policy between neighbors, in earlier, they did support Pakistan and China against it INDIA. after 9/11 they understand a real character of  Pakistan
What about all the children women and men dying in syria?
Just wait till your country gets dragged by this conflict
Putin after 22 years in power realizing he has done nothing to Russia or Russians and decided to invade Ukraine as a failed leader to serve he’s ego.
BBC and Western fake news they distributed Libya Yemeni Iraq, they misplaced million innocent  they came to New game look they worries for people of Ukraine  kkkkkkk
I'm so sorry from Montana 💕
Imagine putting ads on this
poor Ukrainians, their very own government is already a dictatorship and now the Ukraine ppl are being dictated to by Russia.
cant we all just get along?
This is so sad. We need more than just sanctions. Putin should not be allowed to do this!
This is not a joke a nation under attackk... innocent civilians will die because of this act and it will not only affect ukraine but the whole of europe
😪😪😪🙏🙏🙏
Brazil pray for ukraine 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷. Putin is a devil.
Putin is the one neighbour that will break into your house, beat you up, then tell you it is all for self defense.
THEY KEEP PULLING THE WOOL OVER OUR EYES MATEY’S
How dare he attack Biden's Ukraine!!! Most folks don't realize that this is about the natural gas pipeline, and the control of which country feeds Europe with energy. Look at Syria, that was also a battleground for the same thing. I hope Ukraine doesn't end up looking like Syria.
Putin is insane. He is the Hitler of the 21st century. Look what he did to Syria! This man is a monster. I hope Russian protests continue and he is dealt with by the Russians who hate this tyrant. Trump and Putin, what a pair. Remove Russia from the UN Security Council.
Russian people didn't want this war. Most of us want to throw our current politicans. Please don't believe a propaganda of our goverment! Our people're put in jails for liberal opinion.
vladimer putin is a person with NO MERCY
Sinubuk na putin ang us sana wag  na makialam ang us wag na mangatung para pagkakian negosiyo armas su
Ukraine has no chance against Russia.  It is better to surrender immediately and stop killing innocent civilians.
Please come back President Trump
The only one reason i would never get school canceled for...
No, it's BBC/CNN who shouldn't b allowed to spread this bs and such an awful propaganda. It shows everything just upside down

 @Alena Moonsoon  so what's the truth?
(I Share with you the way of Life and Truth and i share it like a Gift you can take it, or throw it away)When something continues to happen for more than one generation, the new generation  considers  the norm and they start thinking this is how its supposed to be, this is why Islam is teaching you, to question your faith, when you know that there is something wrong here, you feel there is something wrong, you question it in order to find the answer that is correct, this is how people come on the right path So dont be afraid Islam has the answers.( The belief, Islam In short form)The belief in One God, One Creator, Allah = The only one worthy of whorship, allone and there is nothing like Him.This Creator send us guidens, In form of Prophets like, Abraham/Ibrahim, Moses/Musa,Jesus/Isa , Muhammad  ﷺ  and many more, peace be upon all of them.The belief in all Angels and Books like the Original  Zabur/Psalms, Tora/Tawrat, the Gospel/Injil and the Quran. The belief in the Day of Judgement and the Hereafter.To believe in all of them and that Muhammad  ﷺ  Is the last and final Prophet and the Quran the last and final revelation from Allah, until Judgement Day.By following and believing in all of  these, you are a Muslim = The one who submits to the will of the Creator.The evidance for this belief are the Quran and the Hadith, you can check both and study it and  listen to those who done it, to understand this believe better and to learn more about it. Maybe you have a bad picture about Muslims and Islam  from things that you heard or seen in the media, but isn't it better to make your own picture, before judge about something ?

Cut the head off the snake over thro Russia take there oil and reform Russia into democracy
Humans are dumb. War is stupid.
Total betrayal for Ukrain
It is only yours so long as you can defend it. Just try parking your car in San Francisco, or a few hundred years ago, welcoming Europeans to your native America.
Sometimes it is possible to avoid war. All should try this... otherwise during war many expressions of people are inside and not coming out. But many person will understand this feelings of suffering in war...
YOU WILL SEE THE  WILL AND POWER OF GOD ! ..you EVIL WEST SATAN NATO AND YOUR REST DEVIL CHILDS...!   CRY before its  TO LATE...the END IS NEAR
I know the real situation there is bad. Lots of people will be sent to die these hours. Nationalism kills. Corruption on the vast scale kills. Brainwashing and propaganda  kill as well.
There was a time in history where 
My heart Goes out to Ukraine 🙏🙏
Respect to Russia from Bulgeria.
This is communist that’s why communism IS horrible!!!!!
Hasn't there been a war there since 2014? With weapons supplied from the West ... r am  missing something?
WHICH ONE OF YOU WHO AIDED AND ABETTED THE RIGGED 2020 RIGGED U.SA. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WOULD NOW LIKE TO TAKE CREDIT FOR THIS?
those jets were russian SU-27s
Please God protect Ukrain from danger and the whole world ☹️
I see no invasion,  Just Street interviews.the world is just a stage
When you f around and sell krokadil across the wrong border and then they come to cash out on you
Lets hope the west keeps its nose out of this....no need for war!
Why don't you go live there if you respect them so much?
Live your country and die for your country dont run like cawards eye for eye
Pray for Ukraine, stay safe please for those people who are out there. End the war, families are dieing because of this...
So what putin did was basicly a war criminal, or did i get there something wrong?
This is unbelievably horrific. I’m praying justice is served. Soon.
Self-defense!!!!!! Are you serious right now dude!!!!! This ain't no d@@@ self-defense!! It's an all out attack and you've isolated these people to kill them!!! This is not cool at all!!!!!😡😡😡
🥺🥺🥺🥺
Russia is acting like  the Germans  conquering land cuassing  destruction  killing wageing war
Ukraine president must be accountable on his childish decisions on his foreign policies that led to chaos of the civilians what a stupid leader provoking Russia to the limit now he wants peace
🇺🇸 Is bullshit. They make business wtih sold military equipment....💵 💵
Prayers for ukraine...😭🙏
this dictator has been rigging democratic elections in his favor since 2008. life for ordinary citizens during the 22 years of his dictatorship has only become worse. he is a worthless manager and unable to build decent living conditions for citizens, but instead pretends to help other countries, in fact laundering billions of dollars for his friends and himself. adequate Russians (90%+) are against the war. we are in the hands of a dictator and his army and police. propagandists on TV brainwashed gullible citizens. Just so you understand, I, like anyone else, can be arrested for such comments. it is so difficult to express one's opinion in Russia. peace for everyone.
People around the world has already aware that this shit war is all about stupid leaders. No bias
the people of ukraine have been thrown under the bus by 
Where is Germany?
Feel it now.  Just as you oppressed Iraq, Syria and the Palestinians
putin go home and leave my friends in peace
I curse putin he gonna pay a high price
🇺🇦  💙💛
If we fight Russia i believe it will most likely escalate to nuclear war, then we are all fucked world-wide.
#BOYCOTT RUSIA
Ukraine please, stay safe, stay strong. i feel horrible
I'm confused and puzzled, why can't so many countries in the world stop an idiot lunatic?
Hopefully someone takes out putin before he becomes the next hitler
Liars liars and propaganda.
Putin go away
Please stop isn’t right this so scary everyone wants peace this is wrong how can bombings be allowed?! Just leave each other alone please. No war. Please I pray for peace
Israel invades Palestine every day and it’s considered normal… something is fishy about the amount of media coverage this is getting.
What the fuck he is doing ?
The US overthrew the Ukrainian government and installed a NATO sympathizer and started putting offensive weapons up to the Russian border.
The liberal left didn't like Trump, so now, they got PM Putin! Good job, Sleepy Joe.
demonic
we will get a new game title in call of duty
Consecration of Russia to the Immaculate Heart of Mary is urgently required.
children and innocent people die in Ukraine
Those sobs are hitting apartments with rockets! Putin lied and civilians died.
How can a whole news agency be spewing falsehood. Who said those in the Donstbar do not want to be liberated? Why would US try to add Ukraine to NATO and refuse Rusia application. Perhaps US and NATO shouldn’t have send weapons to Ukraine. How will US feel when Russia sends weapons to Mexico or Cuba. The west should have honor their promise and not try to make a fool out of them. The west can’t do anything but empty sanctions. I potty Ukraine for believing in the west who are deceitful and do not honor any agreement they have with you
The second hitter
Sad. Its the Politicians who sit comfortably in their mansions making these ill decisions cause instability and war, causing suffering and loss of innocent lives and properties. Do we need Putin, Biden, Johnson, and Scomo still in this world?

Why isn't Ukraine fighting back? Do they even care?
It sucks that as a U.S citizen there is nothing I can do.
Big prayers for Ukrainians ❤️
Nato is responsible...
Leader Zelensky is a hero. God bless him and the peaceful Ukrainian people. The Russian army are like a bunch of nazi's.
Please God protect all people from war
Stop war
To many people comfortable with sitting looking at a screen all day. No worries from putin ...
I feel weird thumbing up a video of this horrible nature -- I neither like the prospect of war, nor particularly interested in seeing more of these scenes (though I know we will). So, I want it generally known I'm thumbing up the video because of the BBC's amazing summary coverage. I just hope the leaders of the Western world can answer this before we're too far down the WWIII rabbit hole to come back.
Most of this lies at the foot of NATO.
Self defense? Possibly the treat inside Putin imagination.
Bye Ukraine
Is Putin a 21st century Hitler? Looks like it.
Bye bye Ukraine
I still have to read Ukrainians say we support Biden and the US against Russian aggression
Let’s go Brandon
It’s all Trumps fault. Remember when this happened during Trumps Presidency-NOT.
This is horrible and terrifying and my heart breaks for all of Ukrainians and the Russians and the world  because NO ONE WANTS THIS ! What else is to come another holocaust With this Russian President at the helm? After all he lied about not going to war with Ukraine what’s next? There has been to much bloodshed already all over this world when is enough going to be ENOUGH?? Jesus Christ we all are trying to make a comeback and trying to survive through this pandemic where millions of lives were lost and still people passing away from it and now this…..  totally uncalled for!    Mr PuttPutt Putin got his nickers in a fricken knot and someone needs to snatch up on his depends real hard like and carry his azz to the basement so move over Biden PuttPutt gonna join ya. From my family to ALL OF UKRAINE 🇺🇦 OUR PRAYERS ARE WITH YOU ALL. 🇺🇸🙏🏼😭
Im like to cry now. 🥺
Praying for everyone in danger. 😫🙏
His mother is abusive to him. He has unresolved trauma.  He is afraid of his own mortality.
lets not blame only putin, its what NATO nations wants. Nato nations seems they r innocent n supporting the world for peace but they r main root of war we have to understand that
US , NATO must react fast before further invasion and civilian casualty...

god bless from myanmar
Wtf is even the point Dumb Puntang really fukn shit up
The Ukrainians are fighting for their country...their lives...the russian military is simply murdering people.
I think instead of bombing innocent people, they should throw the leaders in a ring, bare knuckle and have them fight it out. It's truly sickening how they use helpless people's lives as a way of getting a message across.
No one deserves this. My heart goes out to Ukraine
This is terrible, I hope peace and  love, love from China 🇺🇦♥️🇨🇳
The smartest Russians I know do not live in Russia
Stock up food Ukraine
It's happening!
Владимир Владимирович Путин царь православный! Боже, Царя храни!
Any leader that goes to war is not a leader.Humans- kill warriors.
typical american comments... did you pray for the families of civilians killed in iraq and afghanistan
Ukraine must protect their own country to be save no matter what it takes...do not wait others to help and save you...becouse united nation only like to watch the war just like in the movie without real action to stop it. #BOYCOTT RUSSIA
Putin is crazy! His rational is like Mexico attacking the southwest because those states historically belong to Mexico. Like, what?!
Explanation and facts please. Otherwise your statement is moronic.
No usa shouldn't get into this at all man

Words are meaningless. If you really mean it, volunteer in their army.
 @Christian Johnson  Where does one apply?
Sounds logical. So we should choose Russia’s side as the one oppressed by NATO and trying to eliminate a threat at Russia’s doorstep?

America has lot to answer for in all this ... and they have a great track record   for countries they invade for peace
NOBODY is bombing civilians!! Dont spread this bbc/cnn bs
 @Alena Moonsoon  stfu it is happening
 @Alena Moonsoon  ur name karen? bet you believe covid aint real,
If that happened more often, maybe they'd think twice about declaring wars that are clearly unnecessary
Would never work because it wouldn't be war. And if we kill the leaders who would run the country 🤔
Then Putin will rule the world
 @Alena Moonsoon  wake-up! Still high on drug's or what?
Imagine a world where kings and generals fight their own battles in a cage, with shorts and boxing gloves, leave average citizens and soldiers alone. Wouldn't that be lovely.
EXACTLY regular people don't want shit to do with this BULLSHIT
Pick the people u need and fight it out true not go around bombing houses
Correct this is a cruel and coward attack..why not the leader will fight this on the ring.. I'm sure both of them will end up knock out
Oh please
The leaders aren't firing the shells and missiles. And why should leaders get into the ring if one leader (Putin) is the guilty one?
 @Derek Sun  I didn’t think anyone else realized that
Putin would never lose
 @Penny Boyle  stop your lies
Putin would win against Biden because he moves around with nappies he can't control when he needs the toilet & his mind isn't operating well either & if you ask me his due for retirement in an old people's home.
 @Penny Boyle  how is this the USA fault...we are weak right now if we had Trump this wouldn't have happened.
 @Derek Sun  better him then Biden
 @Laur-un  Biblical prophecy on it's way buddy start praying 🙏
Sleepy Joe is a big winner, He woke up laughing from his dream last night
The world leaders aren't the ones dropping the bombs.
I've said this all along. And they sit and sleep comfortable in their palaces. They make me sick to my stomach.
 @Havenbreaker  ooo Putin ain’t no coward . Cowards are Biden who have no business in Russia’s affairs anyway. But the rest who aren’t coming to aid are all cowards. Sanctions wont’t do a thing as Putin is prepared and aftee Ukraine it only gets worse. China laughing waiting. Just wait people
West and US destabilized Ukraine giving hope and then backing up . And idiot Zelensky clown believed west .
Bruhh I've been saying this all my life, they sit in their offices and give out orders to kill innocent people.
 @Penny Boyle  Russian air force bombed indiscriminately in Syria, Ukraine will not be different. rRussian Air Force has repeatedly bombed hospitals in Syria in order to crush the last pockets of resistance to Assad. The Syrian Network for Human Rights : Russian airstrikes killed around 5,703 civilians, about a quarter of them children. SNHR: 
 @Penny Boyle  Russia has a great histry of kilng children
I hear you but that wouldn’t result in control and power of nations. This is unfortunately how it is done. This is how it has always been done.
The geriatric royal rumble match.
 @Larry Buchannan  wow, I thought I was wrong, yeah you're right. It's them in Iraq, Afghanistan and now their proxies in Syria and Yemen. Not the US for sure 🗿🤡
Yeah you go into work that day at the factory and die. Smh
ong they making those people go through all there bad actions and not even care shit ain’t fair at all . It’s literally crazy.
My thoughts exactly! Put all these warring leaders in a ring and let them kill each other!
 @Viet Hung Le  if that was the case the us would lose just about to anyone.  Don’t see Biden beating Putin, or even Macron 🇫🇷 😂
 @Net_R32  XD
Unfortunately I think Putin would beat any president or leader of any country. He is a master of Judo. He is probably like a 10th dan black belt or whatever their equivalent is, he would kick their arses into next week.
 @DoWhatIWant C  I doubt one factory even, would operate knowing something big is imminent.
 @Mohd Haffiez Mohmad Nazri  It is them that kild millions of PolesIt is them that invaded Hungary, CzechslovakiaIt is them that produced a genocdl dictato like StalinIt is them that createdgulagsIt is them  that kild civilians in East GemanyNo that was therusians
 @Mohd Haffiez Mohmad Nazri  List of countries Russia/Soviet Union invaded - Poland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Czechslovakia, Poland, Belarus and Ukraine.
 @Alena Moonsoon  yes all fake media propaganda machines
 @Net_R32  weather you like it or not cnn and bbc..fake medias
 @Chris Rowcliff  yes sir go Putin
Take the  bullies out with drones get them as they fellate their boss.
. Cowards and criminals.
Wont happen  Putin will attack Baltic states and Poland next.
Putin would win
Yes condemn leaders like this .. this is not what people wanted.. its just this political power and devil.. want this war🇵🇭
 @Larry Buchannan  Russia, USA none of them are good. Let them just fight each other and destroy themselves. The world will be a better place without them.
 @Cucker Tarlson  just make orders ..
Putin is Ex-KGB I dont think it would be a fair fight
Yess
This is fucked up on all angles
It's like a game of chess to them.However, I do believe the Ukrainian Politicians are extremely brave.They know that they will be killed
 @Alena Moonsoon  Yes, their main target is military bases and airports, but in doing so their bomb have landed in populated areas too...destroying homes and who ever was inside.
 @Alena Moonsoon  your saying that like you’re there right now
I'm natural sound positive energy natural video atmosphere villages I love you 🌹🍇🐔🐓🏃💪🐈🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
I completely agree with your point!!!!
If Ukrainian  president loves his people  he should use diplomacy to deal with Russia.Instead he is invoking the rest of the world to fight on his behalf
Putin will win any fist fight. Isn’t that man a black belt as well?
Well now Russia deserves it for what they have done.
Ukraine leaders should justify not joining NATO days before war started.Nobody's would suffered from this war.
All we do is pray
Putin can kiss it
Это вам за Белград! За Донбасс! Работайте братья!
What would happen if ukraine gave in to russia who would he war with then the war would be over and then the Russian people and the rest of the world can work together to remove putin from office
I  hope Russian people think twice get this dictator out and live alone  peace lover Ukraine people.
Putin is another Hitler
Let's wait to see if the Ukrainian people fight back, but I fear that this may be another Afghanistan.
Swift united action could have ended Hitler. We know Putins intention. We can't afford to repeat past mistakes.
Did you give the same reaction to Syria? no.
Hope that Russian invasion will end soon. Pray for Ukraine. God bless Ukraine🙏🏻
US and nato knows only how to put sanctions on the economy to Russian Federation
if they didn't insist in joining nato...simple thing...
That one way to chase away the CIA in Ukraine 🇺🇦👌
May Jesus save ukraine and the world
This is what happens when you put corrupt officials in government!! Ukraine the most corrupt government around !! Hopefully the people their wake up and remove their officials . Who tells their Civilians to pick up weapons when clearly Russia 🇷🇺 said lay your arms down and move out of the combat zone .
The world 🌎 must react fast and stop Putin for foolish invasion....
Make it quick. Kick out nato and all this will be over.
You can't just join. You have to be accepted.
If Russia planned a real invasion it would do it in 2-3 hours. What it is doing is a special operation to liberate Ukraine from their fascist regime. Not a single civilian object is being attacked. Only military objects are destroyed very precisely. Those Ukrainian soldiers who decided to surrender are treated with respect and allowed to go home to their families. Instead of informing civilians of the situation and telling them to stay at home Ukrainian authorities kept silence first half of the day. Then they gave out weapons to the civilians and to former prisoners and mobilised all from 18 to 60 not allowing them by force to leave the country peacefully. Ukrainian army blocked some cities not allowing its people to get out of them. If you think this is a so called democracy you are wrong. If any civilians die it will be solely fault of Ukrainian drug addicted president and his junta sponsored by the US and supported by the EU. Russia did not come to invade. If so it would not care about people and few strikes would be enough to finish it all. Instead Russia came to clean the country from fascists so people of Ukraine will be able to live peacefully in the future without a fear to be Slavic.
Crazy how humans allow a single human to decide the fate of their families lives, putin is setting his own personal history at the lives of other ( less human ) people...
Ukraine should surrender and stand down
People really do suck
USA The Master wars created to most part of the World..May I humbly request Russia to stopped this War against Ukraine.To all my beloved Ukrainians, May God shower, watching and guiding all of you safely and sounds
Any Russian civilians want to comment? I’m sure not everyone in Russia is in favor of Putin’s move?
🇷🇺убийцы🇷🇺
Pray for the war to stop innocent victim getting killer. Putin he. Is no good.
Ukraine dictator leader he’s a liar!
THis is unbelievable. If the sanctions don't stop Russia, the US and NATO will have to intervene. My heart goes to the people of Ukraine.
Down with Putin, stand up ukrainians. Please don't flee,  fight for your motherland.
God help Ukraine people from this animal want to killed the people of ukraine.and take Ukraine oil, nature has and the hold Nation. God help Ukraine.
Snarling Russian leader? not very impartial eh bbc?
Absolutely appalling and sadsending love and prayers to all Ukrainians from California
Putin is demon
Ukraine to Ubang
The pretext was to use the PUPPET government in Ukraine to launch a war and possible regime change in Russia. But now, after too much provocation against Russia, everybody is rushing to blame President Putin. This is called STUPIDITY CON TONST OF HYPOCRISY! This is up to the West and its policies against Russia.
Well America was pushing its western rockets closer to the Russian borders for months. Putin has been saying he will ensure a border space to keep out american military from being within reach of Moscow. It's a sad day because of our politicians failing millions of people will be forced to leave their country in the middle of winter.Sad day for humans across the world.Driven by profits on american stock markets and lobbing money geo politics
I dont get why russia goes after innocent civilians. If they want war go army against army...
im confused but why is ukraine not fighting back
Baltic states left Ukraine die by itself, they are next on this Putin's 
I would have been a dream come true if putin had been on the C-19 death toll list 2 years ago.
🇬🇧 🤝 🇺🇦 ❤️
Wtf?? 
This is another manufactured false flag by the deep state. Russia is not invading Ukraine. Wake up people and stop believing everything being said on MSM. They want a war to distract. The military industrial complex has to always be engaged in wars. The US has falsely made up every war since WW2 to get the US into conflict.
Liberals fucked around now ur guna find out
My prayers are with this beautiful country and it's people especially childrens I hope everything will be settle down in a short time
We say we love each other and our children yet we send them to war against others who cherish life.
Putin he not good person
Stop calling Putin president, call him what he is: dictator Putin…
Comments show public iq.
He attached the UK and blamed them for  it? What a real hero. 🙄
When has war ever been what the public wants? 😂
Bombing residential buildings ? Monsters!
Putin is like Trump. Whatever he says is a lie
Pray for peace ✌️
Stay strong Ukraine! It is now time to UNITE and give all help we could 🇺🇦❤ It is wrong let innocent people to die and suffer just because of pointless war
Putin is a FOOL! The whole world hates Russia now. He lies like dumb tRump while we all watched what really happened. It didn’t work for dumb tRump and it won’t work for dumb Putin. I hope the worst for Russia!
That sirine remembering me Chernobyl tragedy ....
Why. Just why.
Bbc fakery
When you elected a c!Own, Boris John included, to be your leader. You should be ready for disaster.
No wonder aliens don't bother coming here. We are destroying ourselves once again. It's pathetic.
I'm scared for what the world is going through,I do hope it's not entering a world war,I'm tired of everything, please Jehovah God send your angel and stop the war.
man…
Russia has been attacked by France and Germany in the past. Now Ukraine wants to join NATO. This is a threat to Russia.
This is all playing by the eurocentral man his time is running out of the Earth prophecy repent get your house in order Russia's going to send one over here America's really finish people reset time America will be pulled in it
Stay strong my brothers, sisters, uncles, mothers as well as grandparents... The almighty is there for us all beloved ones.
Why the whole world is watching a beautiful country being destroyed, but no one really help or stop this? even the world org.
PUTIN proving that he is not only a LIAR, he's also a coward.All Russian troops must withdraw immediately.  The west MUST send in all available troops.Sorry, but that's their job.M 🦘🏏😎
The media should not inflame the situation. It is not going to third world war. Putin has given new life to western politicians who were facing domestic scandals or failures like Boris cake party, Bidden flop, Truckers protests in Canada. Now all that is forgotten as they will now tproject themselves that they are war time leaders. Rhetoric of these politicians will fool their country men. Military industrial establishment is rubbing their hands in glee to make money again after Afganistan loss.
Why does the United States Government let countries like Russia,China  and North Korea that have horrible leaders that like to kill innocent people even exist. The U.S Government could out a stop to all of it if they wanted to.
Us og
How is a country the size of Russia 
This is insane!!!  human to human.. oh God... Take everyone 🙏
Putin divel...
Everyone knew this was going to happen a year ago. Why all this indignation? Biden had a year to do something about this. He did nothing! Watched it happen. Great distraction for his complete failure to America. American Southern Border, American Fuel, American supply chain, America 1st. Gone.
Amen.
Where there is a tragedy, there is a religious vulture trying to capitalise on it.
Amen,  my prayers go for everyone
Ww3
while if anyone tried to stop the world would end😕
Putin divel...
Putin divel...
So much panic that BBC (British Brain washing Corporation EricGill ) calmly stands and talk slowly. War is a racket!
Russia, China, North Korea, Iran don't have nothing to do with it, it's God doing it as it is written.
why didnt you stop bush?
He said self defense, killings of innocent people is no way self defense, the Russian army are murdering  the people all over the country
Ukraine you can't surrender cause the Russian will killed you anyway believe or not.we are helping you from the enemies Putin Russian want your freedom, country. Ukraine fight for your freedom.
This is our chicken shit as president fault Biden and his crappy Democratic Party we need trump a real president with ballz
Russia cannot be in Ukraine and say 
Abandoned. The proclamation of support by the West won't help. It is disgusting that countries like Germany won't disconnect Russia from Swift. Some EU countries won't even symbolically offer EU membership. So disappointing.
Why do they keep telling that the attack that the west was predicting like 10 times? It's like you keep annoying someone and at the same time keep crying that I'll get punched
This was planned and set up. Yhe president of Ukraine is in on it as well. It's all about building to a one world government plan
Bbc has always been a hypocrite.... Hypocrisy in news..hats off bbc
Whatever may happen, the innocent are the ones to pay as the ones making the decisions are safe.
War zone in reallife
Funny, the world do nothing.
Why did NATO/US start this war with NATO expansion to Russia's borders? Why can't Ukraine choose peace by staying neutral between NATO and Russia? That's what I wanna know
If west never tou h Ukraine and never place stand up comedy oresident to run a country this whoukd never happen ..... of us and uk think this gonna be similar like Syria or Iraq they lost ....stupid West politics...  Time to finish West yuk
if anyone tried to help the world would end man😕
It's a shame as a US Soldier who's served in Germany/Europe in the mid eighties at the height of the Cold War that the other European countries will not step in to help Ukraine. The Cold War has never ended. Ukraine is not in Nato and Putin doesn't want them to ever be in NAT0. Sad to say since the US pulled most of its troops from Germany/NATO it has embolden Putin especially with the current US leadership. I predict that Russia will take Ukraine within less than one month if no other European nations intervene.
Putin: I wOn'T InvAdE
We have seen men surrounded not because they are afraid, I hope they do what they think is best for them✊🏽   I have no words 😶 my heart goes out to the civilian 🥺
S.T.A.L.K.E.R
So sad prayers for Ukraine🙏🙏
Very nice to see today , those 40 Countries were supplying arms and ammunition to the Terrorists and those countries were regularly lossing their lives and values are now enjoying of lives losses of their near and dear ones and shouting for help . Last 70 years undeclared war fought in Asian countries due to western nation's are playing them return and wish to continue it .
Please stop this war !It is useless AND YOU  HARMING PEOPLE AND CIVILIAN  WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS WAR!What will you gain only good people's blood on your hands
The world needs to stop Putin. Period.
Don't worry Ukraine, the world's thoughts and prayers are on their way! You'll be out of this mess in no time. Thoughts and prayers will intercept all those bombs!
Under Obama Russia takes Crimea.  Under biden Russia takes rest of Ukraine.  See the pattern here
NATO wanted this war and Ukraine was the bait. USA will make billions on this war supplying ammunition and weapons to Ukraine. Don’t forget the bush family in the USA own all the ammunition factories.. who is the real devil here ? I think we’re not blind
So much for 
Europe finally understands the horror they've subjected Africa to
This is just horrible, evil.
BBC is fake news. Can never trust them again after how they report on China.
This is horrible,I don't know why they want war can we leave for example,Be strong I hope everything will be fine  hopefully 🇦🇫

If  we dont stop him this time He is going to be over and ver again   repeating violation  of the world peace
Sad for the people but let’s not fall for propaganda as if this is suddenly the most egregious thing done. America, France, U.K. destroy countries, civilians and stability, then lie about it
Weak countries should never join NATO. Ukraine has taught you a lesson
Despicable
The question is where's the NATO at US to defend them🤔🤔🤔
Typical left wing media report, exaggerate and spread fear
Putin disgusting excuse for a human his a bully, liar and thief shut him down now before more innocent lives are lost what is the world waiting for act Now
No problem when America invades countries. No problem when illegals invade countries. But Russia...its a problem
Putin needs to be tried for war crimes.
BBC should be ashamed for showing the Russian people who are speaking against the war. There will be reprisals.
Useless BBC News has Biafran and ambaonia freedom activists in West Africa not being killed imprisoned arson committed yet you kept silent! I can't fall for BBC News and CNN international propaganda. If Nnamdi Kanu Biafran freedom activists who is a British citizen was kidnapped from Kenya into Nigeria and you all kept silent .i don't believe you anymore
Atleast someone has the spine to protect its borders
This is the equivalent to Heathrow being reduced to rubble by artillery… Ukraine ❤️
Go Russia from NZ
White Flag is good wisdom. Be friend ly to neighbour
Wheres those Kirov blimps?
Putin is just supporting the separatists just like America and NATO are supporting the ukrainiest no one ever stopped to think if maybe that was wrong and maybe there wouldn't be a war if people wouldn't be helping
https://youtu.be/L0G9WRRWIuM.
That's directed at you, Bozo Biden and the Democratic Party.
Sucks they waited until it was too late to try to leave
Been looking for the city of Keith on the map. I Can't find it. Is it anywhere near Kiev, Kharkov or Lvov?

Mr putin dont destroy the earth let everyone live in peace
Just as Vladimir  putin  said very beginning  of his presidency Bring back the old  Soveit  empire  in to the russia This is the beginning  of his political  ambitious Now is the time for the United State military  to step in  and take action   against communist  russia   and giving serious warning  to Vladimir Putin    how  serious  it is going to be  for the russia to be  facing  serious consequences  for violation of the peace
Any war is terrible regardless of who is who and all the excuses under the sun. Live to support, don’t live to suppress.
Bloody human race can't live in peace
Time for Ukraine to take the roof off Chernobyl the next time the wind blows to the north east.
They should never rely on NATO. If they want to keep their country, they will have to defend it themselves. Get a rifle and do something about it or be prepared to be taken over by Putin.
Pray for Ukraine.  Where are your celebrities and athletes now?!  This would never happen under 45.  Fact.
innalillahi wainna ilayhi rajiun!
Why putin why kill innocent people are you ok go and get help before it’s too late
I actually support Russia
This is nothing new NATO has left Ukraine again like coward's..Russia is only doing what Europe did in the Middle East so in my eyes PUTIN is a HERO..
Vlad ain’t playin this time…
Stop asking for help cuz I don’t want a 3rd world war! Don’t anyone dare add fuel to the fire!
ww3, nice seeing yall. This world ass anyways
Putin is using Hitler’s play book (Hitler attacked Sudetenland, part of Czechoslovakia where ethnic German speakers lived & everyone was too afraid to act .... NOW Putin uses same excuse with Dunbas region of Ukraine where ethnic Russian speakers live.  History is being REPEATED.  TIME TO OPEN YOUR EYES....      Waiting  too long already as we become the modern day equivalent UK prime minister Neville Chamberlain, who waved a paper Hitler had signed as if that was going to stop  Hitler, while Hitler expanded his power quickly it dominoed into  the attack on Poland and the rest of Western Europe quickly falling to Hitler.       PUTIN IS a 21st century HITLER... He has even deployed mobile crematoriums with his army.... while Trump cheers on Putin.... call Trump the modern day Mussolini who kissed up to Hitler (Putin).       Anyone else see the similarities playing out.!🤔🤨

Ukraine needs to stfu and be in alliance with Russia. Vladimir ain’t playin…
Putin lost his mind. A Paranoid KGB Dictator who can't keep his word. He lost the Cold War like Hitler lost the 1st World War he wants a redo just like Hitler did.
A
What happened to all the weapons the US and NATO gave Ukraine? Only God can help the Ukrainian people .. I pray they fight it out because the US and NATO allies have already said they'll do nothing.
No civilian said he feels that Russians are targeting the civilians but the reporter said so.Civilians said it's the war between Biden and Putin also unlike what the reporter says
Dont mess with russia. The west provoke Russian and taste your own medicine.
Where is nato? UMMM Ukrainians GRAB a GUN and defend your country.. don’t expect the US too
Hate Russia
slav people fight each other instead of fight the real enemy. germany,britain and usa
Really?
This is a children's game for NATO aggressors in Serbia in '99 !!!
Where is NATO …?!
What the fuck? Self-defense? Please explain to me the whole context because I'm pretty sure they are the aggressor here
Please stay strong! Love from Mexico 🇲🇽🇺🇦❤️
zelensky: no one wants to fight for us .. who would you like to fight for your country mr zelensky🤔
Biden sucks !
What happens to my favourite team, Navi?
Let the leaders square among themselves ufc style. dont involve civilians.
Yes why must the young die amongst the fights of the leaders
Why don’t Ukraine join Nato ? Nato would save them from Russia?
Putin in sane !
War, misuse of what true power is about. May Putin regain consciousness, his true power.
USA stands with Ukraine!
That’s painful to watch, but surely we will hear again about one side from US who is the master behind all of the regional conflict, unfortunately Ukraine is just another tool for American war. This was inevitable as soon as US interfered and demolished original governing system after the orange revolution.Non of this would have happened if US stay the f out of other countries politics, if you want war how about in your american soil
This is nothing compared to what US did in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, Palestine. Fuck USA+Russia..... They both are the biggest terrorists, they will never allow us to live in peace.
UN and the west are just useless unable to built up pressure on russia and help Ukraine.  Biden 1 week earlier surrendered saying he don't want 3rd world War.  And gave putin clean chit do whatever he want to do.
usa want this
#istandwithukraine
So sad because of Putin greediness ,arrogant  heartless attitude ,  so many people died and suffer .
Just like when it was Italy vs England, just now much worse, Denmark stands with you, Ukraine!💩RU 💩
My Heart goes out for Ukraine .But Y Dont US , UK & other NATO Allies dont feel Pain of Palestinian Civilians & Kids when ISRAEL Bombs Them No Sanctions Ever ??? On israel ever Really .
“The leaders start the war, and the young have fight and die”
Nato plonga plongo
Who does this Putin guy think he is ??
Excuse me? Denazification? The democratically elected president of Ukraine is Jewish. Wtf is Putin talking about?
Another war based on a big stinking lie.
Biden supporter to Trump supporter 
Vladimir Putin is now the 21st century Adolf Hitler. Why is the world standing around not doing anything. They need to unite and go in and defend Ukraine
So evil. God must be sorry he made some of us
Putins behavior is World war 1 era
Dont poke the Bear
Russia is not to be fucked with Ukraine need to surrender help your civilians
Stop this war. Stop all wars on this beautiful planet. Or we will have no more planet to live on. 😞😓
Time to topple all non transparent Governments
Next-----> Taiwan Meanwhile the most popular US president is clueless in his basement
Where is Nato ? Where is UN ? Where all the leaders who talks about global peace during those meetings??
PULL RUSSIA OUT OF SWIFT
How many children killed ?
Think of it like the Kyiven-Rus people returning to their homeland...consider it like Israel and you will all sleep easier. Go learn some history of what and who the Ukrainian people are...they are the Kyiven-Rus.If you commentators don't have the guts to be consistent, at least don't be so blatantly Soviet with your on-the-nose propaganda.I dare any of you to go to your social media profiles and support sanctions against Israel or the US for countless invasions.Maybe then your virtue signaling could be believable
This news channel is the most biased in the world feed on chinees money.
Because America is not a threat anymore.Next China, god bless Ukrainians.
F VLAD ‘THE AUBERGINE IMPALER’ PUTIN
Putin just wants a glorious  USSR back he is a dictator  like Stalin
🤷
This is so surreal. Like something you'd expect to see in old black and white footage. But it's 2022.
98 already
The way putin said it there is no plan if attacking... less than a week attacks started. Now hes saying its rebels... how stupid a tyrant thinks people are.
I stand with 🇺🇦 🇺🇦
NATO is nowhere around, our so called president, the spineless coward Biden is the cause of all this! He has show his weakness to the world!
It is the utmost responsibility of every one of us in this world to take initiative to stop this conflict provoked by Russia in Ukraine.
This is wrong, why is the world doing nothing?! Russia is a bully
I am from Russia and my prayers and thoughts are with all Ukrainian citizens. This is not Russian war, this is Putin's war. #no_war
Liberation?
Stop Ukrainian rasism and nazism! !!! Ukrainian nazi soldiers hate and killings people and children Donbas!!!
Even after hundreds of years we haven't understand that war its not the answer to anything , Governments only display arrogance and disregard for human life , what was the purpouse of saving lives and creating a vaccine during the global pandemic if they did not care in the end ,  where is the #WHO #UN #ONU #BILLGATES
NATO isn't coming
This is all a ploy to test our weak POTUS...we will feel the repercussions of this too....Let's Go Brandon awesome !!!!
Let em fly..... the nukes....
Russia needs to direct the missiles at people  at YouTube
It has become clear that the United States only fights weak enemies. Japan, South Korea and Taiwan need nuclear armament.
Such a shitty situation. The people of Ukraine are asking NATO for help, and NATO cannot physically help them at this time. Why? If a country in NATO were to try to offer their support such as sending troops to Ukraine, Russia is threatening nuclear war. In which, we know how that will turn out (We will all be dead). So NATO and its allies are doing the second best thing that they can. That is putting sanctions on Russia. Obviously, Russia will not feel the effects now, but over time they will start to feel it. However, as we have seen in the past, multiple Chinese banks offered loans to the Russian government after being sanctioned by the US and its allies. So will these sanctions work? I believe so, in the long run, but I also believe that Ukraine will stand no chance against Russia. Ukraine has the support of NATO, but with Putin threatening nuclear destruction on whoever was to help Ukraine, no country is willing to put itself at risk (Which is understandable). So what do I suggest happen? I'm not sure myself, but I believe that Russia will soon have a grasp of Ukraine and like Georgia, annex it. Whatever the case may be for Putin to be invading Ukraine, he is also testing the waters for NATO. Like how Nazi Germany tested the resolve of the UN when invading countries, Putin is testing the resolve of NATO and seeing their response. Anyways, my thoughts and prayers go out to Ukrainians and I wish you all the best of luck.
Get real Ukraine. Nobody is coming to help you. Either you surrender silently and let Russia take over or stand up and fight with full force while you evacuate civilians.EDIT: This is the true face of our selfish civilizations. Humans are the least humane species on this planet. Every man for himself.
I am praying for peace for the nation.
And your plan is?
Great, so what are you doing to help?
Vodka
This isn’t putins war either dumbas
If Ukrainians are Nazis, why are they led by a Jew?
Get ready for WWIII
Yes, Russia is evil. Nevermind the fact that the US and NATO do the same damn thing for their security interests. Of course I feel sorry for the civilians that suffer from it. Russia wanted compromise, but we wouldn't do it. Like Americans have never had to live with a war started by our government even if we didn't want it. It's not right or wrong, it's the way you perceive it. And western media will always leave out details that would suggest their views are less honorable.
Shame
Safe Ukraine
Praying for peace.  The sad part of all this is the loss of humanity and suffering of innocent people.

Yes, there are nazi, extreme right wing elements in the Ukraine Clive!But don't report that mate!
When Ukranian army fired missles into civil houses in Donbass, Kyiv citizens were blind, West was silent.When Russian army fires missles into MILITARY facilities and no civil houses, Ukranian citizens are horrified.Relax. This is not a war. Its a special military operation against Kyiv regime, not against Ukraine.
THOU SHALL NOT KILL all the countries and people of this earth have forgotten about the commandments. Find my message on my you tube channel and share the commandments to the world. We need to follow the commandments of Moses now more than ever to save our world.
war is really the great equalizer no rich no poor no intellectual no illiterate everybne suffers
Stand strong Ukraine !!!My heart is with you !!!I truly hope the world doesn’t sit idle on this !!!
Please help us Hunter Biden is all I can hear when Zelinski speaks! Lol u dance with the Devil..you die..now he knows this
That what NATO expansion caused. Someone put a missiles at your front door, you removed that, they spam media  all around saying you declares war. Bravo hypocrite!
Send in Alec Baldwin !!!!!!
strange to see us support them send them arms deploy rockets russia warm them now they are crying ....
So sad United Nations need to do something
BBC = big bullshit corporation! And angloism is the new nazism coercing 30nations via bribes to those politicians to turn there weapons towards russia! Ukraine is the red line for russia! Russia in 2000 asked to join nato they were flatly rejected! Enough said! Russia must destroy angloism a cancer on the world!
“You have our hearts and prayers” - The world rrr“……………….. really “ - Ukraine
*the Russian government is evil*, not all of russia
You idiot, this is an invansion

It sat idle when NATO was bombing Serbia.
 @FikusBL  Yeah cuz they were about to genocide a whole country
 @exec   Genocede did Ukrainians over Rusians in Ukraine and Rusia going to save them :)
 @FikusBL  this is waaay different Russia trying to take over Ukraine lol
капиталистическая мафия умыв руки, воюет чужими руками. путин пошёл вабанк. всё, что вы умеете только выражать глубокую обеспокоенность и сталкивать лбами соседей
Lets hope the home ground advantage can help the Ukrainians to win this war
In Afghanistan Iraq and Syria it was not Americans war it was pentagons war
This is horrible!
This is a very good example of leaders caring less & valuing not the lives of their fellow citizens. One man ordering the bombing & invasion of a whole entire country & no one can do anything to stop him, thats abnormal & unethical
will moscow be another hiroshima because of one man alone
Where nato ? They asked wth do you mean where nato Ukraine ain’t even part of the nato and why should we die for Ukraine no way
Bro idk how the Russian soldiers can even press the button to fire into civilians

Luke21 mark 13
Let them see the pain of the people in middle east so far.I hope after this USA and europe will be more sensitive to not invade other country
Now it started
1:55 Ukraine's president fears for his job? Do you really think that this is what any Ukrainian, let alone the president of Ukraine, is thinking about at this time?
They should have kicked the joebama backed nazis out of power.
Pray for Russia,dont trust western lies
Totally uncalled for by a crazy man
🥺stop
If Russia didn’t have around 1900 nuclear warheads, NATO would have kicked Putin, but sadly the world is not like that. We could kick him easy. Russian army is behind NATO updated hardware, but the warheads. Too many will die on both side of NATO intervene. 😕
UN needs to do something really.
No
shut up
Good point.
They got 4000 warheads
4:39 Sorry but NATO could NEVER. An alliance without balls
May all weapons rust in peace
That man evil yet ths richest man on the planet. MI5 don’t pay salaries like that so I’m sure KGB didn’t give him 200bn+ either. I’d say he’s a bit blackmaily and absolute ruthlessnesses incarnate
Ask yourself; 
this is just sad ☹️
Putin likes hiltler
1. My heart goes out to the people of Ukraine. 2. Russia has entered the two rebel-held areas or states. Nothing will change that now. 3. Except for Putin's own values - which includes reasonableness and being ruthlessly practical- UKRAINIANS should SADLY BUT REALISTICALLY expect no effective deterrent from the USA and NATO.4. Because the USA, under Biden, will do nothing effective except largely political posturing. 5. Biden agreeing 'in principle' to a Summit or meeting with Putin -  from President Putin's view, this is laughable.6. He has already taught President Biden an effective lesson in how things run in the real world. 7. Eventually Russia may add Ukraine to the Russian Federation - which is the ultimate price a smaller nation pays for generational   corruption, narrow-mindedness and incompetence in its system on top of being landlocked with a huge, ambitious neighbor.  8. Luckily for Putin, he knows his own mind. And unlike Biden, political operatives do not dictate or run his office. He just fired one of his key figures for not being up to the task at hand. 9. Meanwhile, other serious competitors of the USA are watching these sad developments with keen interest.10. I hope President Vladimir Putin is also aware of these wider implications
very sad news its not good for world.save people nd humanity.
The Fat Controllers planned all of this...
NATO should have kept to the contract that was signed by Corbatsjov and Bush sr
Putin might let have a shower and some gas's chambers like Hitler did
I can't imagine just peacefully doing your stuff and of all a sudden bomb on your house
Oh my gosh seeing this  broke my heart😥
UN and the US Biden in Ukraines  really fucked up this time. Gonna get put in there place
Whose blaming the USA NOW. THAT STUPID. UKRAINE President didn't move fast enough for his people and blame BIDEN putting fear into his country.
how many times can we be looking t the same clips, and comentaries??! comon!!! same comentaries across all stations, are you kidding me?!
This could be Afghanistan all over again for the Soviets...I mean Russians.
Are you fell sorry when US attack iraq,afghanistan etc??? I don't thing so
American supremacy is falling apartRussia and China are Global SuperpowersEurope will be Russian colony.
1. He’s not the richest2. He used to be in a gang and very poor
Fuck Afghanistan
This actually matters
f putin!!!
Not to take away from Russia being scummy as per usual, but I don’t appreciate hearing propaganda in this video. The mom and daughter that were “forced” from their home Crimea 8 years ago... They’re trying to frame the Crimea annexation situation from 2014 as being more violent/displacing than it actually was. People living in Crimea were not kicked out, it just essentially became apart of Russia. I’m not sure about all, but most of the people living in Crimea were given Russian passports. This clip is trying to make it like they were fleeing some super dangerous situation when they left Crimea. Maybe they were singled out because of some type of political affiliation/political situation that makes it where Russia views them as a threat.Even though what most of what this clip is reporting seems credible, that bit of Crimea propaganda really turned me off from listening and taking this seriously.
This is what India needs to do to Pakistan and settle for good
Putin is a monster.
Corruption countries vs Dictator country lol
ok boy's it's the call of duty now !
I lived in Ukraine during the first two years of my life and even though I am not Ukrainian, I will always consider Ukraine as my third country and I am so heartbroken... Ukranians are some of the strongest people in the worldMuch love from Sweden and stay strong, you will win this!
It's like world war two hi Hitler
So!  It has begun in earnest.  WW3.  I am already old so children, it is your turn to cry.  But God help us All.
After Covid, this is just torment on top of misery. The leaders play chess and the common people are the pawns!
War is people's first thought and advancement when a disagrement/ect. takes place. You are hurting people who have not asked to be apart of this terrible, uneeded circumstance. You are bringing in people who have done absolutely nothing. Your petty emotions and greed have brought the same race to hurting one another for personal gain.....MAY EVERYONE WHO RULES WITH NO PEACE GET WHST THEY DESERVE. my heart is going out to everyone....affected by this unnecessary war....im so sorry. We are all praying for you
🍿🥤
No doubt, russia is the aggressor here. But, I think the best way out of it is to give up eastern ukraine with majority pro russian anyway and make it a semi independent under the orbit of russia acting as a buffer state. At least they have western ukraine who are mostly pro west. We have to accept the fact that might is right for now unless the west and US will come to fight for ukraine which I believe is far from reality.
Russia is showing only power over Ukraine.Europe down to your knees.
Nato keeps pushing to russian borders, russia had their own rights to retaliateF with nato, they killed million civilians in middle east and asia anyway
God will judge Putin. That man was bad news since forever....
WHY WHY... i cant fathom the logic for this.
People will also say he won't launch the nuke to end all nukes.
Ukraine needs to fight back
Putin the Devil in a suit..
Where do u see hitler
Glory to Ukraine. Love and support from Ireland.
谴责俄罗斯发动了战争。同时谴责美国及北约国家的步步紧逼，逼迫俄罗斯发动战争。
So sorry for Ukraine why do this Russia? why?
Don't just run,stand up and fight for your contry.
The Russian People needs to Remove this Madman from Power !!!  Putin is A Nazi Russian !!! Not the Ukraine People.  Putin is a Murderer of innocent Ukraine People !!!  Hitler's Spirit, probably lives in Putin's Mentally Sick  Mind !! Hitler who got his day in the End. The Russian People will Hang Putin or his Soldiers !! for what he caused ! Putin is Living in the Past. Thinking he can reunite the 
First Earthquake 🌏, Volcanic eruption 🌋, Floods , Covid-19 , Then Varients now War 🙏 World is in its end…. GBU Everyone stay strong
Guess WW3 has begun

Ill take in a family
I don’t buy any of this shit! BBC is corrupt AF!!!!!! I got money that this footage is old and not what’s actually happening. It doesn’t add up. But you guys can keep buying what the MSM is selling!
He used the word denazification.  I think he is publicly claiming that the NATO is a nazi organization, which is threatening Russia.
Can't the leaders just go in a UFC cage and sort it out instead of taking it out on innocent people.
Absolutely Absurd . This Life is gone backwards.  A Real MAN FIGHT S HIS OWN FIGHT. Not his mates .  It’s financial gain s.
Vladimir Putin needs termination ASAP
I still don't understand why Putin is doing this. What is there to gain you get to draw a new line on the map but you ruin your countries economy and public image in the process?
Can’t believe what I’m seeing
The British army did the same thing to Iraq 20 years ago
It's not Russia, it's an irresponsible separatists organization! please we don't want a war
Where the f*** is the rest of the world?! Why aren't we doing anything about this already?
What happened in Iraq 20 years ago may not have been justified (history hopefully will provide the truth), but to compare what Putin did with what happened in Iraq and call it the same is pretty stupid IMO.
Finally, someone is pushing back at the globalist natz. Putin the only one with ba**s!
Those look like Nukes
Typically Russian! Never put the work in it yourself.... go and take over the ones that work hard and achieve, and STEAL it from them.  Once again it's Ukraine.... 
This goes against everything NATO stands for, Putin will not listen to reason. NATO needs to put a stop to this quickly before things get worse. The threat of nuclear WW3 will get closer with each passing day. Putin must be stopped swiftly to save thousands of lives. 🌍☮️
THIS IS ON THE HANDS OF THOSE PEOPLES WHO VOTED FOR BIDEN,,,,,HAPPY NOW,,,TELL IT TO THE UKRAINIAN PEOPLE.
Russia feels threat coming from Ukraine? What does urkaine have that Russia doesn't military-wise.
We have known that this was going to happen since the mid90s and somehow we’re not able to do anything about it? This is a fight against democracy now? Look at Georgia and Crimea
Not right how innocent people have to die because of a person's wanting of more power!!
I do not like this!!! Hillary Clinton sold Putin 20% of Americas Uranium mines that makes nukes.Biden allows Putin to finish his pipeline but shuts down Americas pipeline as soon as he took office.Thousands list jobs.Our country losses its fuel supply. Communism, Biden/Obama at work.
poor russians  people
Matter of time before the states effected
About time to get a taste. Zero empathy. Cowards
Apple needs to bring back the USSR flag because that’s what the Soviets want to be again.
Innocent people don't deserve politics & brutality destroying their lives.
IYeshua 🌹 the Lord rose from the dead and he coming back 2k after...These are the signs Matthew 24
I can only imagine how horrified those poor people are- imagine the young kids who are living there. I’m praying for Ukraine and hoping all will be good
Those Ukrainian voters who voted for Biden would feel so good about this. Biden wanted this.
Well u tested the Russian bear and u got a taste of what the bear can offer. God bless Russia
I am 45 years old. Never read or heard any one good word from British media about my country. In this video Putin words are not translated correctly. Why BBC ignore shelling Donbas cities by Ukrainians during 8!!! years? Russian lives doesn’t matter?
True. And noone sees it. There way more behind this than People think.
Nice name
Patton was right about Russia.
really hope i dont get drafted in this sht.
May GOD cover the people in Ukraine with HIS precious blood against the enemy and keep them all safe  LORD. Have mercy upon Your people in Ukraine LORD. In JESUS MIGHTY Name. I pray. Amen 🙏
This is such a terrible injustice against a peaceful, innocent, independent people.  Putin is all out lying, paranoid, and a murderous psychopath.  He’s incapable of creating anything good, he could never raise his economy through innovation and inspiration.  He’s a dark dead vampire who has now set his sites on Ukraine.   The Russian people don’t want this, they need a Democratic President, and Russia should be broken up into at least 3 countries.  It’s too big, too oppressed, and too poor.  Putin can’t even manage what he has, yet he wants more.  Evil Lunatic.  I hope this war ends quickly and results in the toppling of Putin and his government.  Let God’s hand be merciful to the good people of both Nations, especially Ukraine because they are under attack, and let God’s hand come down heavily upon Putin and his cult of criminals.
This dude Putin has lost it this is the beginning of the end for him
Putin is now the Darth Vader of the world.
It is not just Russia who is to be seen as the culprit here. Why does NATO want to expand all over Europe and surround Russia on its western border? The major intention of expanding NATO is to deploy the troops there. As we have seen in the past, US starts with extending a 'Support' and then goes ahead into full fledged deployment of troops.Putin will feel threatened as the US has always opposed Russia. He will be worried about his security. I agree killing thousands is not justifiable. But US has been doing this for decades by extending their so called 'support' in the Middle East and Africa.US have always called the communist ideology as terrorism. More than half of the US population believes that being communist means you are a terrorist. Is this right? The tension was initiated because of US.Afterall, why does the US have to come in between every country that has some sort of internal issues going on? Will US be okay with Mexico joining Russia and setting up military bases? Think people!
There will be wars and rumors of wars...God
It’s so easy for America to go fight a war on someone else’s soil ! 😢 people (civilians/kids/mothers/fathers) are going to lose their lives and for what ? America’s ego ? It’s not right…let’s protest this WAR ! PLEASE
Ukraine doesn't like to get involved in European war.
This is terrible, Vladimir Putin and his selfish decisions, his desire to force Ukraine back to the control of pro-Russian government officials is nothing more than greed and a lack of a regard towards the citizens of Ukraine. My condolences to those who have died within the first hours of the attack and my wishes that the people may escape the fighting. Slava Ukraini, Heroiam slava!
This man is a coward bring it on russia
hope they all die of covid
Oh look. Again the “Conspiracy Theorists” were right.
O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?56 The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.57 But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
World war3 is beginning🤍
There is one way to stop it. You have to do it as it was with Usama ibn Ladin. Otherwise, it may end up with a large-scale war.
Pray for Ukraine 🇺🇦
GOD BLESS PUTIN< PROTECT US FROM NAZIS KILLERS!
Heavenly Father Jesus Christ please help Country UKRAINE🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Stubborn and arrogant leaders killing civilians what a world you are going to create 👎🏻👎🏻
Horrific.  Unjustifiable pure aggression.  The world aggressors are taking advantage of the weakness in the White House.  I fear for Tiawan next.
They have no God they evil people
Fuck you humans…
Putin’s face looks disgusting!
Ukrainian should not have joined the stupid UN fuck the UN
I feel sad for the Ukrainians, but they need to fight. If Russian tanks are alteady in Kharkiv then the Ukrainians haven’t even slowed them down. Ukraine can’t expect help if they don’t risk their own lives. They’ve had 9 years to prepare. They seem to be just going on as normal.
Russians can not EVER be trusted!!!
So all these people died  power na
DO NOT FORGET THE TRUTH:-(1) IN 2014 AN ILLEGAL CIA BACKED COUP REMOVED THE DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED PRESIDENT YANUKOVYCH BY FORCE!r(2) KIEV SIGNED THE MINSK AGREEMENTS IN 2014/2015 AND REFUSED TO IMPLEMENT THEM.r(3) INSTEAD KIEV REPEATEDLY SENT THE NEO NAZIS AZOV BATTALION FOR 8 YEARS TO KILL & TORTURE WOMEN, CHILDREN AND COMMIT GENOCIDE AGAINST ETHNIC RUSSIANS CIVILIANS!rSOME UKRANIAN NAZIS ARE OPENLY DISPLAYING NAZIS SWASTIKA PARAPHERNALIA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I wanna talk about my heart hurting too. Since that is all everyone is doing about this.
To save innocent lives and historical property and money, just find a way to stop it.  I'm sure America will find any excuse they can to get involved.

Maybe it's time for the war between communism and democracy! :( ..... anyway, I really really hate the WAR!
This Phuta president of Russia just a trash. you attack someone country and give excuse for security. what a moronic person
Had NATO agreed to not allow Ukraine into becoming a member , Putin would not have invaded. But instead Nato acted defiant thinking Putin would not invade. And the Ukrainian Pres talking smack about nukes gave Putin the reason why now he had to invade to prevent it.  What a shame that men can not live in peace. Jesus Christ said Love your neighbor as yourself. We love all the christians on both sides.
uk,bomb, russia die
casualty count estimate just ran up to 500,000+.  all because of Putin, and Russian nationalists.  and he (Putin) just inadvertently admitted to being a Nazi.  i was wondering when the West was going to forget Adolf Hitler, and move on...well, here's the answer to the question.  quantum-synchronicity.  it's not a coincidence - it's reality.
If they give me my right to own a firearm I will help defend not only the USA but any other place needing the help of the USA
Russian Bear is coming back
My heart goes out the civilians 💯
I gotta say I'm impressed; this is one hell of challenging and dangerous mission for the Russians to be undertaking. I didn't think they'd be so confident to launch an attack this ambitious.
Ukraine has been trying to join NATO for a while now, since many of it's sister countries have successfully done this, which scares Putin for good reason, this VERY large country suddenly gaining the protectorate status of a NATO member essentially puts the power of the US on a very large border of Russia, and Putin does not want that to happen.  
Not sophisticated precision weapons by Russia, hitting apartments for fucks sake
Fight for your freedom Ukraine! I hate to hear the horror has unfortunately began.. cheers from Canada, wish everyone the best of luck with this!
What propaganda!  This “invasion” ‘that Putin promised would never happen’????? Putin made it VERY CLEAR for years -except the West has not listened and would not negotiate. Keep poking a bear in the eye, always getting your friends in with sticks , saying now we are going to sit right outside your home front door and keep threatening with more pokes. No more growling and warnings from the Bear!! He has had enough. And these hoodilums were killing all the other bears in the next cage. Well the big bear has had enough. Warnings and negotiations do not work. And if Ukraine thinks it has the USA/UK behind it, have they not heard of Libya, Iraq, and Afghanistan?  Sad days for Ukraine. Who are your real friends Zelensky?? The USA will have him out one way or another. And the country is  a mess about to get ruined. Joe Biden is  beyond demented. The Americans have been brainwashed into Russiaphobia and all their media starts the story with omission of historical facts. What a bunch on untruthing and devastation when all this could have been avoided. The USA/UK did not care of all the other countries they have invaded. Why is Ukraine thinking it is so special that it will be protected?!?!
STOP THE WAS.
Sad…
Russia will destroy Cabala Nation
Korkak USA USA sadece masum ve silahsız insanlara savaş acarsınız
We all just gonna watch or step up?
Ain't none of our business 🤷🤷💯
Don't believe everything you see in western news ....
In response the Vlad, then the democratic world must achieve the de-Putinification of Russia.
If China would oppose Russia, then there might just be no more Russia. China claims they want to be seen as a good country, and their support of Russia shows otherwise.
please stay safe Ukrainian peoples love from 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
Putin only done this due to so called president bidens weakness and unwillingness to act.  i believe a lot of people believe that to be true.also the world is still trying to deal with covid so his timing couldn't be better for him right.NATO should do a hell of a lot more than they are actually doing which is bare nothing, i cannot see how all these so called super powers are prepared to stand by and simply watch rather then do something positive for Ukraine and there people. the world is betraying Ukraine with ridiculous sanction'sgod help them all.
Ukraine should surrender to save lives. There shouldn’t be any resistance. Innocent lives will be taken.
Did you people feel this bad for Iraq and Afghanistan when America did this?
Ukraine accepted NATO without Putin knowledge. They gets what they deserved. Putin said that he attack only military bases. And Ukraine still dont want to end partnership with NATO!
I pray evry day the god will do it this .
Amazing how one of the reporters (dificutlt to point due to our culture) opens their mouth so much
My heart breaking 💔 for Ukraine 🙏❤️
Dis is wat happens wen u shitty president n trust j bidden ... dis game of america ...
Stay strong People of Ukraine✊🏿 You will prevail!
It seems Putin took a look at what Trudouche did to Canadians and said I can do that in Russia as well. The mainstream media said nothing and now they lament this in another country?
pray for ukraine
Korkak usa
I bet the lady at 7:45 got a knock on her door from the police for speaking against the government. Russia is back to the old Soviet ways. Put a mustache on Putin's face and you couldn't tell the difference from Stalin.
The devil will always have his workers
UKRAINE IS  SO CORRUPT and Putin Should do us all a Favor and Replace Ukraine's Government.I see this as a Non-Issue and Biden is such a Numscle and suck an Idiot who can;t fight his way out of a wet paper bag because it would take to much 
Russia is simply trying to secure peace for the future, the irresponsible leaders in Kiev are responsible for the tragic civilian deaths
Whose the bad guy of the world now huh?
No because everyone who seems to comment in this thread is a literal moron who can’t even realize that their own county (america) is literally a shit show
Ukraine is a independent country it’s not part of Russia Putin has no right.if Ukraine wants to koi. NATO it’s countries right Putin is so call self defense is a excuse to what he really wants is to restore the Soviet Union
No they will lose and lose bad.
When exactly did ukraine attack Russia to make it so fearful. All the deaths are on Putin this was all his call his orders.
Ukraine belong to Russia , they old president sold them for like 14 billion .
Interesting that it says Russian stocks  fell sharply
Darth vader is rebuilding the empire
Really horrible. Have we learned nothing from history?
ANTI RUSSIA PROPAGANDA!THE WEST USED THE UKRAINIAN PEOPLE LIKE TOILET PAPER, AND NOW IT WANTS TO USE THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE LIKE TOILET PAPER USING BBC PROPAGANDA!
All youtube member pray for the ukrain 🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵
Russia proving to the world:  They are SCUM
ITS WAS ALL THE USA’S FAULT! We’re the devilish country
To be honest I'd rather have Ukraine not be in the NATO than risking a third world war if Russia decided to attack a NATO state. Because then NATO would have to act. On the other hand that's probably what Putin wanted because I don't think he would have attacked if Ukraine was in the NATO.
So when TRUMP WAS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES REMEMBER NO WARS !!!! WHAT IS GOING  ON NOW?? BUT I STILL DON'T BELIEVE ANYTHING NEWS SAYS AS TRUTH!!!!!
The West are getting a taste of their own medicine, and it tastes bitter. Concocted justifications of War. And the civilians suffer. May the atrocities end here, and everywhere else around the world.
My heart goes out to the Russians, i hope they deal with these facist very fast.
ukraine will be divided. One part will control west one russia and everyone happy except ukranians.
Fight back Ukraine. Russia did this in Afghanistan and we mujahideen drive them out
Putin really brave, come on putin show your true power, and please kill this media first
Glory to Russia America = JEW loving Nation
From a Pole in Canada, stay strong my Ukraine brothers and sisters we pray for you. May God keep you safe during this horrible time.
I do not like the Russian leader at all, but he is not snarling.                 Is this or is this not all about the Nord 2 pipeline, and access to the Balken Sea, in order to get Russian gas to Germany?
Imagine going to visit family in the ukraine, and then you can't leave during a war..
Supposedly there is 40 total deaths. How is that a large scale attack, thats how many people would die in car crashes driving away in panic??
Putin will die a lonely man and go straight to hell.
I knew this was going to happen for years.. smh
Be strong ukrain people stay safe 🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵
I want to cry all them kids and the babies and inocente people there man😖😭
Ukraine wants to join NATO, why doesn't NATO accept her? Why is NATO not sending troops to help Ukraine now? Ukraine needs more support!!
USA has a duty to protect Ukraine because it promised to protect Ukraine and destroyed nuclear weapons
I’m going too hiding :(
This is, of course only the start in Putin's chess game plan..A. Mutually assured destruction, genocide for the world.B. They let me take another country...The slope is very slippery.. If he ever says we'll stop after this land grab... Just obvious lie.Had respect for him... But, eh.. :/
He had no such plans?!  What did they think Putin was doing posting all his troops and weapons at key points on the Ukraine border, having tea? WTF are these people on!? And can I have some?
Putin is trying to reassemble the USSR.
🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬 Russia get  out!!!!!!!!!
Yankees are cowards
God helps Ukraine in this problem
Please, no nukes russia.
Take down the President of Ukraine now . 🇺🇦 will be side by side 🇷🇺
It seems to mean that Ukraine had Nuclear weapons And Should have been pointed at Moscow and USED..I thought Ukraine had a army and we gave and trained them on our weapons.. They need to hurt Russia Badly so won't try it again for a long long time.. NATO better be ready.. a 90 degree turn and the threat goes to Poland, and Eastern Europe.. Fighting a NATO military well equipped and trained will be a whole different out come But they better be ready to stop any Russian threat.. Nuclear or other wise. Stop the delivery vehicles and missles and they blow up Russia..You know Hilter tried this he was stopped at Stalengrad..
Europe learn to speak Russian language USA is finished.
Self defence that is bulshit glad me Putin needs to be put against the wall and B shot that his war crimes
It's not just the deaths, but also the destruction.
zelensky puppet in the hands of NATO NAZI UKRAINE MUST BE DESTROYED
We're is there military
This is wants America wants now they'll get it
Putin needs to be taken out very quickly
Nah Russia deserves the win.
Support for Ukraine 🇺🇦
lady's and gentlemen again the reincarnation of Hitler 🤔
BBC, what a joke... If Putin didn't do this WW3 WOULD BE GUARANTEED FOR SURE!.
Why are we all other countries so useless? Shouldn't we always ALWAYS stand together against aggression?
propaganda
This is a  political war that will cause many innocent casualties because of political beliefs and power ! This is a Cold war revisited
Putin is a pos. He deserves everything he has coming to him
Buckle up world ww3 is just around the corner 🗺️
This is mass murder!
RUSSIA OWNS USA AND UK 👍
Biden got what he wanted
Crimes against humanity by Putin .
Russia don't feel safe no more to develop corruption, poverty, freedom and democracy abuse!wonder what country is gonna be next.
PUTIN NO.1 👍
how does 1/35 different reporters miss pronounce Kyiv?
Getting their asses kicked
not quite 🐑
he has nothing coming to him....man is on top of the planet
The western media and their leaders mocked Putin saying he didnt have the guts when it looked like he was about to withdraw his troops from the border. Well we now know how that turned out.Never taunt your enemy when he is withdrawing.
RUSSIA FOR THE WIN
The world done nothing when russia invaded other neighboring countries, now it is embolden by the world's inaction. Good luck to all of us, specially Ukraine. I hope we dont let such evil continue to run anymore. I feel bad for regular russian who are powerless against their nazi-wannabe dictator.
Why does the USA have 15 biological labs in the urkraine?The USA would be up in arms if russia had 15 labs in mexico...F the new world order
😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥
79% of the Russian people supported their President Putin because for 8 years Ukraine has become a fascist, Nazi Bandera state, which is already threatening to create nuclear weapons and destroy Russia with the help of the West, when the West has been wanting to stop Iran for more than 20 years so that Iran does not create a nuclear bomb.  And he didn’t say anything about Ukraine when the Ukrainian clown Zelensky threatened Russia that he would create a nuclear bomb and bomb Russia. That’s American democracy, that’s what the West wants to do with Russia with the hands of Ukraine. And the Ukrainian people are not to blame.  only Ukrainian military installations no city is bombed by Russian troops the Ukrainian people can be calm.
This shit is beyond scary. And I speak for the world.. 🌍🌎🌏💔
my prayer to civilian...keep strong yall can go through this...hope this will end very soon🙏
Putin wants to de-Nazify ukraine.. He's afraid?.Hes doing just what Germany did after/because the treaty that neutered them.. Putin wants his old lands back, and the people, production, money, oil etc.Power and land which was ours!...lying to take countries
I don't support war, but this is necessity, America should leave USSR to deal with thier problem and face the USA crisis. American are using Media and propaganda to spread terrorism, what happened to Libya, Afghanistan, Iraq etc..... American meant no good for this earth.

Ukraine is gone Europe will be next
Don't call that rabid dictator 
Horrible subhuman.
Protect ur country die for ur people coward prime minister
Never ever surrender at the end Ukrainians will win 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
Its Putin who is a dangerous fascist.A man who hates freedom, justice and democracy,Sadly just like the current British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson and former US President Donald Trump.We live in dangerous times.
CNN, BBC, etc are just as biased as RT News is. In fact I believe RT News would never have come about if it was not as a direct response to western media that is biased. No difference. It pays to look beyond the media reports that these institutions have been feeding. It pays to listen to critics that have been warning about power imbalances since the 1990s. Open your eyes people with regard to media reports.As usual the victims are again the civilians - this time in Ukraine.I accept that it is almost impossible for the Ukrainians to think of anything else but hatred right now. I do believe though that we have to try to do everything to avoid more loss of live. I feel that Selensky is not doing the right thing by asking every civilian to pick up a weapon. That is foolish and suicidal. Please come to your senses and do not follow this president. It is not worth it. What is worth it is life !
NATO should NUKE russia before its too late, this is just the start of world domination
Putin great president 🇧🇩❤️🇵🇾
What are you talking about the west has been saying this exact thing was going to happen for weeks lol. Where are you getting your info from
it's Ukraine not 
 @Residue Fingerz  i guess this should trigger you, 
@DD: Unfortunately he is very clear in his mind - unlike our friend Joe. He in fact is so clear that he knows exactly what he is doing. Every move bas been calculated and prepared well in advance. while this is a tragedy fo the Ukrainians, it does not pay to underestimate Putin. he can be called all sort of things. However nobody can say that he did not try, warn and notify - and all of that since the late 1990s...  Unfortunately it is the Ukrainians who have been played in the most cruel way. You certainly cannot blame them. They are the victims in a game that has started long ago. They are playing an inhuman price for the actions of others far far away at their strategic tables.
Control 🤑
 @peter hansa  go live In Russia and see how much fun you have. You will be crying for your mommy.
 @peter hansa  go move to Russia you traitor. Stop making our president look like a joke to other nations. I don’t like Joe that much but you honestly need to have hope in our country
 @autofilms atf  It's a Russian troll farm account, lol.
Losing? I'd say he lost it.
HOPE BIDEN DECLARED WAR ON US AMERICAN PEOPLE WERE THE FUCK YOU LIVING UNDER A ROCK FUCK LOOK AROUND YOU DUECHE BAG
Pootin is being beat back by Ukraine 🇺🇦 LOL. How embarrassing... small man syndrome at its finest 😂
lol subhuman...he's literally on top of the planet...owns more land than anybody
Russia f*ck off from Ukraine. You have no right to invade Ukraine.
😭😭😭🙏🙏🙏pray for ukraine 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
The Ukraine won't be the last stop.  The terrorist Putin is no doubt trying to rebuild the former Soviet empire.  Which nation will he attack next under the guise of self defense?  Too bad the CIA doesn't assassinate leaders anyone because I can think of a very deserving target.
This look like the beginning of the Armageddon, he will not stop with Ukraine, they will move in Europe for war.
Shit got hotMy condolences to the people of Ukraine
fuck you eu beaches!!!
All Europe will work for Russian Empire they'll be good slaves.Orthodox POWER
This is dumb
Nato did this in Serbia for tree months.
NONE, just make up your minds and NUKE or COBALT russia you puzzies
EU is besieging russia and is giving them no choice but to expand
Where is NATO?You are not apart of NATO so why would they assist other than give sanctions
Y’all arnt part of nato Most of nato and Europeans talk shit about the USA until Russia and China knock on their door Pathetic
We support Russia 🇧🇩❤️🇵🇾
such a beutiful country with shit puppets in charge
Stay strong Ukraine 🇺🇦❤️🇵🇭
Remember Ukraine did not help with the Impeachment process of Trump. Biden (Dems.) is quietly getting even with Ukraine for not helping them Impeach Trump.
Wag the what
🇧🇩❤️🇵🇾
Europe will be a Russian Colony
Serbia has been doing this in the Balkans for several years.
 @mazarek  doing what?
I don’t believe the media at all
🇷🇺 🤢 💩
So poodle feels unsafe with Ukraine joining NATO on his doorstep but instead of that he’s now going to increase his doorstep so that he will he what feels unsafe with the next country bordering Ukraine this is insanity
WOOOAAAH Hearts of Iron 4 in real life???!!?!?!!?!
Putin the new Hitler
Yanks are cowards they're afraid of Russians Orthodox Power
Stay strong Palestinian! 🙏

And just think Trump 2 days ago praised Putin for what he’s doing
Putin has a small weewee
It's a shame you don't speak to the 3 million people living in the Donbas region.
Putins people do not even want this.
I’ve been saying since years that putin is a bostard sof.He firstly put Jehova’s witnesses in jail only for believing in their faith, then the homophobia, then the violence increased increased and now this…..Someone has to stop these sobs involved.He starts a war, he should be b. O.m bed by everyone
I doubt it is Russia
WHEN RUSSIA  IS WINNNER,DEEP STATE LOOSE FORZA PUTIN !  UKRAINIAN NAZI MUST BE DEFEATED
Xiden was installed by Deep state election fraud FCK JOE XIDEN. This would never happen under Trump
1:19 “civilian infrastructure” with huge military radar
Ukrainians right now do not need prayers, they do not need condollenses, Western interventionism is what they need right now and they want Putin's army to get out. This war has clearly been declared on a faulty justification of pre-emptive strike to protect Russian sovereignty. Nearly no one has supported this war but the Kremlin and Russian separatists.
Oh... but.It's a mystery We get to find outWhen we DIE
this is very sad ....should have never gotten this far......now they all suffer
Putin Is a fool.  His own people do not want this
Western countries are sh!t too. Letting Russia put them to shame. F*ck putin and his small d'ck army
Lets face it I am not for or with Putin but what he is doing should be understood by the people of Ukraine that Ukrainians is being used by their government as a shield to hide the true meaning why Russia is attacking Ukraine. Ukraine is being used by the Americans through the effort of NATO to install a missile in Ukraine facing Russia which angered Putin and declared an invasion of Ukraine. Putin has a reason for invading Ukraine I am only worried because the Ukrainian's were left as Collateral Damage.
Europe is Next
I woke up to the sound of the sirens.. my blood ran cold as soon as I did.. shit's terrifying
BEADY EYED PUTIN...just like donny trump...a bold face liar sociopath.....
Hats off to those rescuers who is saving people while their own lives are in danger
russia finally showed their true color
Where is NATO? They apply there power against poor nations. Do like what you did against former Yugoslavia, Iraq and Libya.
BBC: Broadcasting 'news' to serve their corrupt globalist, war-mongering masters for decades.
This is terrifying to watch...
Russia is hitting airports and military installations. But some missiles and cannon fire will hit civilians.
Ask US and NATO FORCES to leave UKRAINE. This is the cause of the WAR at Ukraine as long as the INFIDELS (US and NATO) is there.
Ukrainians don't fight Russians America is evil Orthodox Brothers
Nato is the one to blame.
love from philipines to ukraine💗💗💗
Humanity is never going to reach its full potential
Can any news please explain why Ukraine has been harboring increasing amount of USA missiles last 2 years while they had not ever been member of  NATO. I am against of any violence or war however if you cousioncly causing a reason for it u might have to face for it. I hope 🙏  this invasion will be the least bloodiest war. Good bless every soul in Ukraine 🙏🙏🙏🙏
And what do you want? The end of the world?
Wait are u Russian ? 😅1v1 bro ?
The missiles could be in Latvia or Estonia, but they are not there. Why should they be in Ukraine?

Strew you putin
Wooohooo,  get some,, boom boom boom. Oil prices rising.. mother Russia is taking home one of her runaway children. Long live Russia. Long live Putin!!!
Revelation 16:14 They are, in fact, expressions inspired by the demons......and they go out to all the kings of the entire inhabited earth, to gather them together for the war of the Great day, of God The Almighty
PUTIN IS BANDIT AND KILLER UNDER THE RUSSIANS LAW!!! HIM PLACE LIVE IN PRISON...
Why do so many people just follow what one person says? I don't understand.

For posters from places like Georgia and Poland, I can’t imagine your level of concern. You understand this evil at the highest level, and how the world sells you out with no pity. As for the rest, I am spit upon most of you who claim your heart goes out to Ukrainians. Are you from a powerful European country that is doing nothing to help? Are you sitting warm and cozy buying your energy from Russia too soft, too greedy to endure any inconvenience, because your heart hurts so much?Or perhaps you are a pathetic, brainless American leftist, who fought to put the incompetent Biden in office.  Because it is by far his replacement of warfighters with generals focused instead on woke that allowed this to happen. Just one year ago, Putin would not have dared. But, he knows we weakness, and your weakness is killing people. At the end of the day, you don’t care. You sacrifice nothing and invited this. You are the problem. You caused this. Aggression rises in the face of weakness. And, in the history of history few are weaker than you.
Joe Biden is a weak president
Russidog and commiechina is root of evil
Even some Russians who are anti-war did not want this unnecessary  invasion to happen yet putin doesnt even listen to his own people and still invades Ukraine for what? Like i dont get why is he so greedy trying to steal Ukraine when he already has a country to take care of 😐
The Globalists took us to World War 3. Covid-19 was the Black Swan Event for the economic collapse and end of civilization event to follow. I believe this will go nuclear within the next few days if NATO enters the fight.  Remember, Putin spoke with Biden multiple times, as did Macron. Putin was trained at The World Economic Forum.  They all subscribe to the Nobel Lie. Ukraine was Russia, that is their history. The West will use Putin's actions as the event for The Great Culling.
Killing innocent civilians seems to be part of Putin's plan. An acceptable loss.
There’s so much BS manipulation by these complicit Legacy MSM liars,  look CLOSER and there is NOTHING of the kind!!
CNN: firery but most peaceful invasion
support Ukraine from Morocco
🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦❤❤❤
De-militarization means removing the military and for the latter removing nazis
Ukraine will not be easily defeated like Poland in 1939.
FIGHT BACK

My heart goes out to these people.  I see the Russian trolls are out in full force in the comments.
PRAY FOR 🇺🇦 🇺🇦 UKRAINE 🇺🇦 🤲!STOP THE WAR WHEN PEOPLE DECLARE PEACE ☮️ ! Allah is with UKRAINE 🇺🇦 inshallah 🤲
go to hell putin! stop killing Ukraine people, my great  great uncles where hung and shot in time square because they where teachers. this makes me so angry
USA IS TOOTHLESS
Most of the important ex Soviet military leaders in the high ranking are originally from Ukraine and even his ex boss in the KGB. Ukraine will not surrender easily.
Is Putin actually stupid? We live in a day and age where anyone can know what's happening in the opposite side of the world two minutes after it has happened. His lies are pointless
Glad to know Putin truly cares lmfao what a piece of shit
God bless Ukraine 🙏🇵🇱🤎🇺🇦
Unfair war !! It must be stopped immediately  !!
When will this world grow up?
Why ???? People are dying just because of that War is Russia know what it is doing????? I can not believe it 😠😠😠😠😢😢😢😢😭😭😭😭😭
Putin is doing with Ukrain the same Hitler did with Polonia...
I pray the US and UK stay out of it military wise
UK and the US keep talking, but will they do anything? No. They use empty words, empty threats and are pathetic. Can't wait for Russia to attack the EU as they won't even defend themselves. Nato and the UN are old jokes that should be forgotten!
Self defense?????? Nahhh Putin is a real terorist,
Help us to save Ukraine 🇺🇦❤️
Ukraine  should  surrender so no civilian and casualties will happen. Just my opinion.
Why Ukraine is so much important1. They have very good power of building Arms Ammunition2. They have key outlet at sea in Mediterranean3. They have strategic location4. Compare to development Ukraine has more economical development rather than other separated Russia countries5. There are many people in all these 10 countries who wish to remain together with their MOTHERLAND RUSSIA.6. Many within country indirect political support to bring back Russia7. Many parts slowly being changing to Other religion and their Activities which is a big concern for local people where present government indirect support creates big rift in Christian and other religion follower8. International political bilateral communication with Present government not happy with working of specific need support from Ukraine and keep giving information for Russia to make threat and support bilateral issues9. Local Authorities knows the Society rifts and favours the Russia to remain on safe front considering, MAFIA ACTIVITIES, DRUGS AND SUPPORT, TERRORIST ACTIVITIES, ILLEGAL ARMS AND AMMUNITION ACTIVITIES, ECONOMICAL AND FINANCIAL CRISIS OF BANKS, CHINA SUPPORTS FOR DEVELOPMENT, ETC.Well all are open causes and it is not hidden or not like could not be seen. Ukrainian are very good people but TO LIVE IN COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS THEY NEED REASONS TO GET DEVELOPED AND CREATE FINANCE We can only pray for those people who died in present war situations and May God Rest Their Souls In Peace.
To the warmongers who created and produced these acts, a warning        YOU ALL WILL PAY             AND YOUR DAY IS ALMOST HERE        INNOCENT LIVES HAVE BEEN RUINED        MY WORDS WILL MEAN SOMETHING!!!!!
Illuminati propaganda at the finest
We watch in horror as people fear for there lives in the ukraine ..This is awful to witness.Pray for all the innocent children ,families, brothers and sisters.,mothers fathers..Peace be upon you all.
Oh God
Ukrainians seem to be holding ground.  Anyone thought what happen when Putin loses ? He will be done in Russia.
Stop war many civilians affected specially the kids the future of tomorrow!!!  We ar all humans, we are all equal
Putin is murderer
War Isn't The Answer ‼️‼️‼️
Can't watch this anymore! 😢 War put people's life at stake. You can reconstruct the materialistic damages, but CANNOT RAISE THE DEATH TO LIVES. HOW CAN SOMEONE BE AT PEACE BY TAKING SOMEONE PEACE!!! THIS IS EQUAL TO COLD BLOODED MURDER.
One person , with the guts and the will to take out this cowardly dictator .
This always happens wen the selfish west always interferes
BBC  what a terrible picture at the first sight of this video! Unfortunately fake !!  Sure, it’s BBC!!!!
NATO pushed Putin to attack.  For years Putin been telling NATO to not come up against it borders. But NATO insist on doing so. America would do the same thing, if Russia had troops in Cuba or Venezuela. So stop being hypocrites, when the US and Britain pushed Russia and thinking Putin would not do anything, because all he did was talk for years. ........ Where is the condemnation of Isreal that fires rockets into Syria daily. With no provocation from Syria.
Putin is a nazi. I hope people who live at Russia realize this and overthrow this nazi who spits on all the ww2 survivors and russian war veterans by he's actions.
💔
the russian civilians faces's should probably be blurred. They may get in trouble with the government
Russian Bear is coming back Screw IlluminatiScrew the committee of 300
If this happen there it's a possiblility for it to happen anywhere which we are seeing this same tactics happening in also other parts of the world
Idk. If these Russians are sincerely against Putins war on Ukraine These Russians need to pick up guns instead of protest signs and attack Putin from the inside.
Selfish west? Now who’s attacking?
 @Ngon1420  where is nato now
May be munching on some popcorns

Horrible incidentsInnocent people are suffering
Ig this is the beginning.. Stay strong everyone ❤️
I'm sure we got something in that Wuhan lab that can solve this 

1992 the US use kuwait to create gulf war, now they use ukraine to create world war 3.
It's very sorry to see the situation in Ukraine.pray for the victims
this is so sad how the west is just letting the communist just take over democracy's its just so sad.
Prayers for the peace of the whole world specially in Ukrain 🙏🏻😔
Hope that mustang makes it out….
Putin: 
The absolute uselessness of the West when it comes to another Caucasian country. Where's the collaboration that killed an estimated 1 million Iraqis? Ohhhhhhh they were weak and brown.
You know I'm always against us jumping in to other's business and all. But it's like he's still saying, 
That eyebrow raise tho... putin kinda sus.And he's super sus poor civilians they died in vain I can't even believe that in our modern world where people are educated that war was never beneficial to everyone like wtf I hope Russian can say something about what their leader is doing.
It’s clear that all you know is what you have seen on Western mainstream media. You’re incapable of seeing things from under the surface, to see what’s really going on.
 @Trips  What an intellectual counter-argument.
 @Trips  so you gonna drop some sources and examples or just talk out your ass?
Exactly. Now, say that to those people on the middle east.
It’s not defense, they’re trying to see if the US will end up letting them invade so that they can in the future do more things like this and get away with it
Trips is correct actually,  Ukraine were shelling and blockading the Donbas region for years, they didn't keep up their end of the Minsk agreements, Donbas formally asked for help from Russia. Putin didn't see Ukraine honoring the agreement going forward so he acted and made his point. It's actually more cultural the conflict, he's rejecting nato and its wokism they push.
 @Trips  yes the whole world has been made out a fool by western media with live pictures and reporting ,,, the whole world is blind to not see the agression ,, only you are the one with true eyes
 @Juniormint  Donbas is Ukrain. The insurgents holding Donbas are backed by Moscow. The Government has a right to shell terrorists.
 @Juniormint  russia has reinforced the pro russian extremists in ukraine for years ,,, if that is the case then every country can just arm the extremist groups in other countries and occupy their territories and then ask it to follow its orders ,, NATO might have been responsible for many things in the past but this war is on putin ,,, NATO did not cross the border putin did ,,
 @harsh kumarf  what you describe is a very common strategy used by powerful nations against weaker ones... it's unfortunate how all our international law doesn't apply to those who break it the most
 @Hi_LifeHero   About 80% of so-called separatists are russians, and all that began when new ukrainian government openly promoted discrimination against them. Yes they got much help from Russia, but mostly in form of trade agreements and volunteers before. I don't support what happening now, but it has a reason and kinda solves the problem with minimal losses.
 @Trips  blah blah trying to be a smart ass. Fuck your arguments
 @Huebo  What do you think will happens if Ukraine join NATO? Russia will be fucked, that's why they defending themselves. If you don't understand about national defence, stfu
I don't like Russia, But Civillian air ports can be used to launch military air craft, its just run ways, hangers, and control towers, same thing in a Military Air Base.
 @Juniormint  Is Donbas was Ukraine or Russia region if Ukraine why they don't have right to protect their territory from insurgents group, Please explain ?
 @Bone Blyat7.62   And everything wil be rebuilt better for russian ppl taxes, may just call it a renovation of sorts.
He is not in delusion..he protecting the nation to NATO or from US. Ukrain and russia are the same culture,language and etc.
Does he believe it? Could he believe it? I don't see how, no-one could believe such bizarre things.
 @Trips  it's clear you are talking from your rear because turds are falling from your mouth.
 @Zaidan Alfarizi  What are you even talking about? Russia isn't defending themselves, they're attacking and Ukraine would never join Nato regardless. The leading countries in Nato literally wouldn't let them
 @Nethrex   it is more complex than the west media is putting it , the east of Ukraine is mostly russian speaking and orthodox and wishes to be closer to Russia , it is historically badly joined it would have been preferable if it was split in two with those wishing to stay russian aligned allowed and those to the west doing their own thing , the Dnieper river seems to be a natural border point which has mostly russian speaking to the east and Ukrainian speaking to the west and a large river is a good buffer zone , this reminds me of Northern Ireland  republicans and loyalists trying to share the same land that's why that has been going on for decades
You don't understand. Obama exploited the civil war in Ukraine with a hard push to join NATO. Ukraine has been a neutral zone between NATO and Russia and this was an attempt by the West to abolish that neutrality and have influence there. If this were to succeed then it would be like Mexico agreeing to give China influence in their country... that borders the U.S. The U.S. would not tolerate that anymore than Russia would tolerate NATO in Ukraine.Putin never wanted Ukraine, but if he can wreck it before they join NATO, then he has reduced the ongoing threat that has been present for the last 7+ years. As you pointed out, they even took out an airport, you think Putin wants to destroy infrastructure he could have? Of course not, but if he didn't want it then that would be expected.
 @Ngobz TV  Is he now? Nato never threatened to attack them and never would have. Ukraine is an independent democratic country and Russia took that and dragged it through the mud. Putin is forcefully taking an independent, democratic country who never asked for his help and plans to replace their entire government (chosen by the people of Ukraine may I add) How is this protecting Russia? He's only protecting his own ideals and the so called Soviet Union which fell countless of years ago. Putin is denying Ukraine the right to be a country.
 @Juniormint  Are-you-stuck-on-stupid? Ukraine has been fighting against pro-Russian forces who were being supplied by Russia.
Get over yourself the missile probably came from Poland with Made in MIlwaukee stencilled on the tail  .//// the West has been pushing this for months
 @Sneat   and NATO countries have been supplying Ukraine
I wish people would use their brains a little more , everyone here seems to believe it's NATO's fault or Putin's fault in totality , the reality is both are to blame and they have both pushed their cause for their own benefits either politically, financial or militarily , this could have been resolved but it's much easier for both sides to play games with other people's lives , no Russians Europeans or Americans will be killed in this but they seem to be the main influencers on BOTH sides
 @Literal Garbage  yeah! some you said is right maybe?.we never know what NATO plans (hidden agenda) for century Russia and western are not friends for some reasons. NATO nor US is waiting to grab the opportunity to strike.  but above all this conversation regarding the conflict no one is right or wrong because we have all thoughts what is right, for me what i said is right he protection his country and hes fellow men. RESPECT brother!.
 @John Duffy  Aid to Ukraine has come after the fact, and rightfully so. Ukraine should get all the help they can.
Russia is  hitting the airport because US has supplied weapons to Ukraine.  Instead of sigh a deal with Russia that Ukraine Will Never join NATO.
 @Juniormint  How bout the US supply good ole Chechens terrorists and then just invade to prevent the subsequent “genocide”?  Perfectly fine right?
 @Literal Garbage  are you sure. They let the Baltic states join NATO. If Putin didn't do it, NATO would just wait until Russia is weak to incorporate Ukraine. It's strategical thinking.
I have an updated version for the propaganda poem by To Huu in Vietnam Land reform 1953“Kill, kill again, the hand never stops for a minute,For paddy rice growing fast, taxes will be done quickly,For the long-lasting (communist) party, walking together with one heart,Worshipping chairman Mao (Zedong), worshipping Stalin to the eternal
 @John Duffy  why you are lies , I'm from Ukraine and Kharkov it's near Russia ...Yes we speak Russian but only in city and in village mostly people speak Ukrainian  , all Ukrainian people speak Russian and Ukrainian language and we never has problems with that . We never want to go Russia with her dictator ... All 30 year's Ukraine try to be free from Russia but Putin don't let us go ... All Ukrainian people hate Putin and Russian regime .. in Donesk and Lugansk  7 year we has war with Putin dogs ..he don't need this 2 city only  need week Ukraine..  U don't even understand how many Ukrainian people and soldiers die for last 7 year in Donesk  and how much we are suffering from all this ... I'm in Turkey now but my family , my friends and all my country fight with this crazy Hitler alone . I don't want NATO because it will mean WW3 and in same time better I will die then my city will go Russia .. Ukraine will never be free and she always will be sweet piece of pie for NATO or Russia .. I'm sorry if my English not perfect but I tried to explain everything how it real
He's just using the same excuse by the US when they invading Iraq. I guess it's karma?
 @Yung Chicken  us is not Hero and like War
 @an Can  Ukraine joining Nato would be a good thing anyway, Nato has no intention in starting a war with Russia regardless of how many members they may gather, Nato is already more powerful than Russia in both economic and military force. It's not like Ukraine would be essential to invade Russia. There's a reason we're sending sanctions and not bombs, starting a war would be dumb and unnecessary. Russia has countless of nukes at their disposal. If anything attacking Ukraine just gave them a bigger reason to attack Russia yet they're not doing it, do you know why? Nato doesn't want to start another war and Putin is very well aware of this fact which is why he went through with invading Ukraine
Wat Ukraine needs is aircraft s not weapons on the ground even drones might help to defend it's country by only ground troops won't help were is NATO Putin will achieve his goal yet USA or NATO can't do anything about this war between these two countries.USA, said they will be swift in their action if Russia invades ukraine.there you go see for yourself how Swift they are in their actions & words.next will be Taiwan after china seeing USA only talks but doesn't get involved seriously with other countries war as long as it's not a member of the EU.they (China) can achieve what ever by taking back what they believe is theirs,-they will go ahead with their plan.
The world should join forces to attack America. This is our time to take revenge for Asia Middle East and Africa.
RIP Uk.
What the heck he means  it’s all self defense? 💀💀💀
This is insane. If Putin want to go to war with someone, get in the cage with the other bloke! And leave the gloves off, pussies. Leave the innocent out of it.
We are orthodox christian Russians,,, attack!!!!!!!
This is what presidents and politicians do.Playing war,which wont affect them in any way at all.They are safe,they have millions of dollars,surrounded by millions of soldiers to protect them,deep inside some nuclear bunker,watching a tv and having a laugh,while innocent people are dying.If there was even 1% chance of presidents dying in the war,they wouldnt be starting same those wars,they would dig trough the concreete with their bare teeth to avoid any kind of conflict.
MASIVE $$ there make out this Wars. Amo news reporters oil photos just on on ! And control I guess. A holiday to Hawaii for Some . Bravo 👏 Governments 👍🏻💉💰📈 so sad
Politicians will always start wars but the common people are the ones who pay the costs and suffering
This is just wicked. Bruh on some Adolf Hitler actions smh 🤦🏾‍♂️ 🙏🏾🙏🏾
Play stupid games win stupid prizes
Biden will stop this!….
It is sad. Why ?
The new Hitler that needs taking down ASAP
Must fear for his job? How about his life? His country?
What is NATO and US doing? Sanction your ass while their military demolishes Ukraine and it's too late.
Hey Ukraine! How confident are you with your Comedian/Actor President?
When will we do something US
Screw Soros
This is sad...

Watch how Russians and Russia gets hated for ever
They are going to invade, the US won't do shit, the world is just watching, sanctions are stupid...
PHUCK OBIden the most
PHUCK NATO &PUTIN WHY? WHY? WAS IT MONEY? TO KILL PEOPLE?
The very people criticizing this are those who cheered the invasions of iraq and afghanistan.
Where are all the Russian protests.  They are afraid of being arrested?  The Ukrainians are afraid of being killed.
A murderer in the power seat . Says he will not , then he does . Just to think , the world is only just returning to normal after Covid , now they are engulfed in a pointless war of Putin's . One very sad world run by even sadder rulers .
Those guys on the trains full camo rushing to the front line big respect 👊🏼.
Exactly it is Putin Biden war,  no one should fight in this war. Putin  and west fight because of nuclear weapons'
Russia 🇷🇺 Russia God with you America fake news and lies Russia 🇷🇺 Russia God with you because you are true 👍
I wonder how bad this is going to go? Scares me. Heart ❤️ out to the civilians in Ukraine 🇺🇦 🙏
Isn’t it very fitting that a communist megalomaniac is saying the word Nazi. One and the same thing are they not. They had a chance to take this guy out 100 times and they never did it now look where it’s got them
Putin knew he didn’t need much of a big army to take over and like to demonstrate how weak the Ukrainian really is
Ukraine is betrayed by the democratic world. Germany, US...
The allied forces need to assemble a special ops strike team, sneak into Russia and take Putin out for good.
Dear Lord, please forgive all of our sins and heal our Land (World), in Jesus' name.  🙏
EXTREMELY distorted reporting. SO tendentious.  You so distort the truth, it's pathetic. But that's ok, lies will always eventually be exposed
Hes a nasty little thing isn't he!! My heart goes out to the Ukrainians
Ukrainians want Peace?  How about EIGHT YEARS of Kiev bombing the hell out of the Donbass territory because Luhansk and Donetsk overwhelmingly voted for independence from Ukraine.  A democratic vote which is allowed under the Ukrainian constitution!  The majority of the people in Donbass are Russian speaking, and many Ukrainians hate Russians since the Soviet Union defeated Hitler's occupation of Ukraine.  During WWII, Ukrainian military, militias, and citizens were allied with Hitler.  The Soviet military liberated Ukraine from the Nazis.  At that time Stepan Bandera was their facist Leader against the Soviets.  He is still celebrated today as a hero.  Generations later the hatred for Russians still exist, as well as a facist ideology that justifies eight years of daily bombings in the Donbass region where over 3,000 civilians have been killed.  The BBC and the rest of the corporate news disinformation doesn't talk about THAT!  The US, NATO, and the EU is siding with facists in Ukraine.  Not surprising since in recent history the US sided with ISIS in Syria to defeat Assad.  They failed.  After 8 years of failing to broker a cease fire and negotiations to remedy the situation in Donbass, Russia finally said ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!  Russian Peacekeepers is the best solution to stop eight years of killing in the Donbass by Kiev.

So sad ,,,,,my friend was living in ukraine,,,,,,may God bless him😭😭😭😭😭
Just put the two president in a cage and let them fight to death.  Innocent civilians casualties are not needed.  Just the leader.
Prayers don’t do shit. No western countries will intervene. All for power and money.
He is so scared for his boy that he is hiding like a cockroach. Go get a weapon and protect your boy wtf?? Goddamn loosers, I guess some other man, should fight for you?
this reminds me of feiget hitler who invaded poland in 1939... so sad watching this happened in this era
No one finds it suspicious that there is no actual footage coming from ground zero and how everything is getting censored? Besides if your an american like me, this is europes problem we have enough problems, we dont need another bogus occupation and war for the rich to get richer and for our men and woman to die !! Wake up people!!
#may Allah bless both countries!
so where is nato ?
Putin = Hitler
Why don’t all the religious just pray and make it go away? Exactly what I thought.
Russians army is the best army in the world
An US and Russia plan.
The inferior will fight the politicians and bankers wars.
Men of Afghanistan learn something from Ukraine . And women of Afghanistan , you're stronger than your coward men.
So many Ukrainians are willing to defend and die if needed. Their love of their Country is quite moving.
Where is NATO?
Much harder to do when there's a rifleman behind every blade of grass.
This would have never have happened if Trump was still president , people forget how the entire of Europe and US have been provoking Russia constantly , every action has a reaction , I don't condemn war or death of civilians but I condemn to stand for yourself because no one else will.
If Biden would just give Ukraine a handful of Tomahawk cruise missiles with neutron warheads, and announce it in the UN, this would all be over in minutes.
America all time evil character, the only thing which triggered Russia in just few hours is its b-52 bomber excercises and it is for sure buff plane directed by a buff leader!
Russians have been trying to get rid of this Nut Case for years.
Can't stop tears😒😥..My blessing for you all🤲🤲🙏❤
russia will end up dragging north korea, pakistan and china into the war.
Not my fight 🤪
This is utterly shameful!!!!
fuck off ..!!!!!  puttin  the cold war traumatized you, and your resentment eats away at you puttin you don't know how to deal with your trauma and it does so by attacking to the weakest
What a goofy ass world leader and people wanna follow this guy to war the soldiers have the power to not fight but hey do cause they have little heads and stupid thinking kill little kids and innocent people while the person declaring war sends them to die and kill innocent people waste of life putin sits in a office with his stupid ass look on his face and brain washing his own people this pure example of a heartless piece os shit
Surely someone can sneak some cyanide into Putin's vodka.  Evil exists because idiots let it exist.  You hear that, Trump and your band of idiots who think Putin is 
God bless Russia 🇷🇺 Russia God 🇷🇺 Russia 🇷🇺 Russia God with you we ❤ Russia 🇷🇺
Grab your guns and go fight. Why are these young men giving interviews rather than going to go defend their country?
Your propaganda is unforgivable.
“This was self-defense” yeah OK Putin. Like anyone actually believes you.
Russia will destroy Cabala Army
self defense as you bomb innocent people . Sounds like a bully at school who got hit for the first time.
SHAME ON ALL WAR, KILLERS, BIDEN PUTIN NATO

This is what ukraine gets for selecting a comedian as president of ukraine. Where is Nato and USA who promised to help? They fucked with you again.
Putin = Hitler
Biden was supposed to bring stability and leadership. Trump kept Putin in control. Biden as Obama, who let Putin keep Georgia and Crimea, will lose the Ukraine. The favorite lie of the liberals 
FJB!
Where is NATO??   They're not in NATO.  What a stupid question.  Where do you guys find such rare gems??
He is reminding me of damn Hitler😳😡
This is uncalled for , wicked people
Pray for Peace🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Putin can demilitarize himself into early grave. Warmongering, civilians killing grunt.
West is falling apart West is finniished
World leaders the past 20-35 years didn't do enough to shut him down before it got to this point.  I'm willing to take in a Ukrainian family.  If somebody can get them here (Colorado, US) I'll give them a place to live. 🇺🇸🙏💙🇺🇦I also have compassion for the people of Russia who do not want this horror.  We love you, too.Pray for peace 🙏🤲🏼🤝🏽🕊☮
Where is the US? And the western world?
I am so sorry to everyone who has to deal with this horrible situation. Prayers for everyone and  god bless you all  sending love from Canada
Democratic hahahahaha you tell funny joke you dummy !!! you are only there because of an american coup back in 2014 FFS wake up and settle down with your silly rhetoric !!

No ,Putin didn't start this war...The NATO,  GREAT BRITAIN AND US IS THE ONE WHO WANT IT..This THUGS IS THE ONE WHO NEED TO PAY THE PRICE...IDIOTS...RUSSIA WANTS ONLY TO DEFEND THE ARE BORDERS...GO RUSSIA KILLED THE ALL..
I feel so bad for the people that live in Ukraine 🇺🇦 God bless you all and hope you all stay alive 🙏.
Pray for Ukraine.
NATO Strategy to Encircled Russia is the origin of this conflict. Nato will transform Poland 🇵🇱 , Romania 🇷🇴, Ukraine 🇺🇦 and Baltic countries into warzones between USA and Russia 🇷🇺.EU should aligned their strategy with Russia and Create a powerfull Eurasia instead of doing USA dirty work

ukraine president treathen russia by joining nato, and russia responds by taking ukraine back, then west media portray putin as the instigator, hmm... when they unify east and west germany it's ok, but ukraine and russia its not? i guess they really want to start a war.
OH! You even a found a couple of those rarities that 'fled' Crimea  LOL  ok. 2%?
Nothing says self defense like aggressively attacking an innocent neighbor. Shut up, Putin. The world knows you're a sleazy low-life liar. Russia will pay for its crimes, and the free world stands with Ukraine and Georgia, which Russia also attacked in 2008 which everyone has forgotten about.
My heart and prayers go out to those poor people and their families... may a miracle from God intercede for them.. so very sad.... prayers
🙏🙏🙏🙏♥️♥️♥️♥️🙏🙏🙏
What did you idiots think Mr Putin would do? Fck NATO
It was the same thing UK and Russia, US did to Biafrans in 1967 we will never forget
Western countries are making Russia as a villain in this situation, Russia wants Ukraine to avoid signing in to NATO because this will just escalate the situation more. Ukraine should be sensitive in this issue, they should put their place in Putin's shoes, you don't want US bases or missile batteries near your fences.
How about the de-Russification of russia
Vlad the Emperor Biden is Satan
I still don't understand why... why does putin choose to be violent enough to hurt, traumatize, injure & murder innocent civilians??
I will fight for Ukraine but USA will not.  Pathetic.  You will regret this.
how long we could watch this without helping the people of ukraine! god, please help all of the people of ukraine!
RUSSIA SHOUDLVE DESTROYED UKRAINE LONG TIME AGO
the father asks 
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Glory to Great Rus!Glory to Putin - our Tsar!
Mother Russia 🇷🇺 can kiss my balls 😎🇲🇽🇷🇺🖕🏼
Those residential buildings at 1:00 look a bit suspect.
Morons at war
The Ukrainian leadership made a big miscalculation
Russian leader says he sent out a warning and that it’s self defense as if all he did was a love tap. You literally just killed innocent civilians bro
What does Putin want from all of this? What would you do if they surrounded your country with military bases and troops, play along and sing? The Russian government is no Mother Theresa but they are acting on their own interests, just as the so-called west when they invade middle eastern or African nations, or try to destabilize Latin American countries. Putin is not a boogie man, he is just another politician trying to preserve or grow the power of the nation he represents. You and me and everyone reading this comments are just numbers on their minds, Biden, Putin, Macron, Trudeau, Scholz, Johnson, etc., all of them belong to a different reality than ours. We shouldn't be 
Why is everyone suddenly calling it kiv
Did u watch trump the antichrist praise putin and conceive using similar tactics versus latin America.   What a bunch of losers

Damn. This actually happening. Unbelievable.
While civilians are getting hurt and killed we have a president who's trying to find his way inside the White House! I wouldn't be surprised if this man accidentally nukes a country that's not even Russia....
I'm curious if Russian Netizens are agreed to have war to Ukraine.
Where's Ukranian army?
Still less civilian casualties than an American invasion though ey
Building??  They haven't been building anything, only destroying.  Ukraine is an extremely stagnant and corrupt contraption that has done nothing but brutalize certain segments of its own population.  THAT'S the truth.

USA is weak Europe will be under Russian dominance Orthodox Power
Too free, nothing to do!!
POLANDS 🇵🇱 ON THE BOARDER WAITING TO FIGHT WITH YOU !!!! STAY STRONG
Didn’t USA bomb innocents in Afghanistan
“You have our hearts and prayers” - The world “……………….. really? “ - Ukraine
Hitler ALL OVER again!
This tragedy occurred because Russians believe they need to defend themselves from NATO.   It could have been avoided if Ukrainian leaders had provided a guarantee not to join NATO or if NATO had provide a guarantee not to let Ukraine join NATO.     But it seems both NATO and Ukrainian leaders wanted to provoke an invasion by Russia. I suspect they are hoping for Russia to suffer the fate that the US suffered in Iraq.  But after successfully provoking an invasion by Russia NATO and Western leaders have abandoned Ukraine.  This is a terrible deception and betrayal of the Ukrainian people.
Jesus is coming back, the Rapture is near…
🙏🙏🙏
Its like putin is American!!😂😂😁😁😁😁🚨🚨🚨🚨👿👿👿
Ooh shitIts happening :(#Gujranwala, Pakistan
I'm very sorry that these people in Ukraine has to go through this especially loosing loved ones. Love and support from America stay strong Ukraine 🇺🇦❤️🇺🇲.
If other country joins the ukraine it would be a world war 3. Let both countries settle their problem. We don’t want the whole world involve the war!!!
TF IS THE UN DOING
When will the leaders of countries learn that people want to live in peace. The one thing war always brings is more death. #God bless everyone
West is falling apart East is the only option Russia and China Global Superpowers
Thank you Putin 👏👏👏

Love it
What else can we practically do though?
 @pepsi taylor  not that useless shit
If thoughts and prayers did anything the world's problems would be answered. But here we are instead.
Prayers dosen't mean shit
Pepsi TaylorVisit the r/Ukraine subreddit
Evacuate the women and children. All able-bodied Ukrainian men should enlist or coordinate with their country's military right away. Dig in and setup a proper defense. Only then can the outside help them.
 @Steven Meinking  true but now we've got men also running away only a few patriots they have to defend their countries
 @Ayi Donno  Prime Minister Zelenskyy already urged civilians to stand up and fight. He claims he can arm them all.It does no good whatsoever for NATO or any outside countries to make a move if the Ukrainian citizens themselves don't show they are willing to fight for their country.
Exactly. Putin started war because NATO won't promise that Ukraine will ever be a member. And they tried to make Zelensky think that Ukraine had a chance in being a member of NATO. Now the war started, NATO is now like, none of my business lol. If they really care, the us and nato should send in troops. And most Ukraine civilians death were killed by Ukraine bombings. Nato really should send troops in to stop Russia, Ukraine forces are outdated and not well trained.
Well, I am taking my family and as many as possible with me to somewhere much safer.Anyone have any ideas where the safest place/s to go if things get really, really bad?
 @Woohoo Cheefy  wrong. Ukraine has been in war since 2014. I think they are more prepared since they've seen action for a few years.
 @Ayi Donno  so should we send our soldiers to defend something they won’t?
 @Woohoo Cheefy  our troops shouldn’t touch European soil, let the Europeans handle it!
Why are they going at Putin. They never went at Bush Or Clinton or Bush Or Obama or Trump for attacking Afghanistan and Iraq and killing their people nor did anyone have a go at Howard or Major from England or the West for destroying the middle east coz of a little group. Stop the hypocrisy. Also, wait for more hypocrisy, on the way Ukrainian asylum seekers are treated compared to the ones from Syria. The international community  are already saying, every country should open their borders, for what will be around 5 million displaced Ukrainians 😉🤙
 @Mustafa Sahin  because Iran and irag had rouge dictators and governments that would kill very many people including their own and take away basic human freedoms. Ukraine is not doing that. Totally peaceful country wanting nothing other than freedom.
 @Screamified  regardless of your resent-filled comment Youtube stranger, I am going to continue to pray for them! Have a blessed day :)
So the world’s uniting under heart felt prayers and that bothers you guys for some reason?
 @Woohoo Cheefy  if NATO intervene that would mean WW3 just happen, Ukraine is not an official member of NATO thats why it can't send troops there. NATO promises only defend their members, nothing more nothing less. But they did their best by sending military equipment
 @Woohoo Cheefy  NATO requires all 30 members of the organization to accept Ukraine and other requirements.  Not to mention it’s mutual defense treaty not a military alliance.
and with keyboard
Don’t strike fear into people with your religion.
You Americans are the reason why my country is in Chaos tell your president to resign
 @Blitz-Soldaten  Russia shouldn’t be invading a country just because it wants to join NATO
 @Blitz-Soldaten  Ukraine should be able to decide if they want to join NATO. Putin's demands are ridiculous. We don't want anything to do with him and Russia.
 @Jayden Rodriguez  Yeah… remember Russia and Cuba?
 @Blitz-Soldaten  us Americans aren't the reason for shit man, I just joined the army and I'm 100% ready to back yall up
WHAT ABOUT THE 14K CILVILIANS UKRAINE HAVE KILLED SINCE 2014?????
 @StarSwiss  you joined to fight for your president's demands now we are in Martial law
 @Jayden Rodriguez  USA are the one's that builds military bases in other countries to threaten Russia. It will only affect Ukraine while the US makes blood money.
 @Sa gup  you mean the 14k Russia killed?
 @Sa gup  Russia invaded Crimea, not Ukraine
@StarSwiss In this world, nothing is worse than making friends with you Americans, because you Americans will only support your friends with your mouth. When your friends are beaten, you Americans will only run away
 @Blitz-Soldaten  americnas did not cross the border putin did ,,, any country has the option to join any other group ,,,
 @Sa gup  probably less that what russia has did in the entire time ,,,, if its about killings i know russians have killed far mroe than 14k in all the conflicts they have been involved in ,,,
@Blitz-SoldatenWe are citizens of America ourselves. How dare you blame us for something we have no control over? Grow some balls and help your people.
 @Dahlia  I am fighting in the front while you all eat and enjoy your god-damned shows
And then what is next betray us like you all did to Vietnam and Afghanistan shame on all of you!! Where were you all in 2014
 @Niklas Vilhelm  and russia does not make blood money ??? what USA did in iraq russia has done the same in ukraine , its perhaps much worse ,,,russia did not even use an excuse of weapons of mass destruction ,, all it did was invaded a country onn the pretext of why that country was joining a group that they did'nt liked ,,, this conflict proves jsut how important nuclear weapons are for saving your country from beligerent nations ,,  if ukraiine had nukes russia would'nt have dared to cross ,,, few nueks and you can be sure that no country will ever attack you atleast never cross the border ,,,
Don't be a hypocrite. If Mexico allied with Russia and the Russia weaponize Mexico... US would do the same to Mexico It is in the national interest of Russia to prevent NATO and US to be at their door step.
YOU ALL SAYING I DONT HAVE BALLS IF YOU PEOPLE ARE THE ONES WHO DIDN'T DO ACTION GODDAMMIT
You American  destroyed Libya. Iraqi. Afghanistan. Syria. Palestine Yemen Venezuela Zimbabwe
 @harsh kumarf  never said anything about Russia. Fuck Russia, fuck USA
It is because of your demonic country that all these are happening
 @Jayden Rodriguez  don't talk if you don't know
 @Blitz-Soldaten  how is that the reason please give explanation
 @Blitz-Soldaten  how is it our fault? 😂😂
 @Rocky Yams  I can’t talk about facts?
 @Blitz-Soldaten  yah ok I will tell our glorious leader that lemme just quick dial him,
 @Blitz-Soldaten  gets invaded by Russia , blames us
 @Phoenixalldayy  I blame you because you made them angry
 @Phoenixalldayy  then come here if you say I'm not a coward you come here and prove yourself worthy to fight the enemy if not you are one of those key board warriors saying to my people that we don't fight
 @Phoenixalldayy  have you picked an AK before?
 @Phoenixalldayy  call me a coward if you are one of those people that stayed home relaxing and watching us die as you see here I didn't sleep well because of the bombs I hear, I never tried to run away as I'm staying in this apartment alone
Russia is invading because they know America will do nothing
 @Niklas Vilhelm < Red skum
Zelensky is too naive and are barking at the wrong door. Be like Afghans, they defeated Russia, the US, and NATO.
 @Blitz-Soldaten  it’s all fun and games till u hear the trees start talking Russian , u appear to have picked one up , pick one up again
Why is NATO not coming to their aid?
US/UK/NATO fully to blame.. good luck to the citizens of all countries involved
I've stayed right there on vacation.. Love the Ukrainian people.  GOD BLESS 🙌 UKRAINE
Why does Putin call it the de-nazi-fication of Ukraine! Anyone out there who can explain.
Why the fuck is this monetized
Just like ww2 ,Putin wouldnt stop at ukraine.FU Putin
Humans= The worse thing on Earth! A more dangerous and even more powerful strain of Covid is certainly needed now in that part of the world! 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️
MQ-9 Putin
Typical spin of western presstitudes. First and foremost, you heard from Putin himself that it was a defence against the attacks heard earlier allegedly by rebels which is from the pro-west camp. When the jackals of US wants a war, they truly know how to create one. Divide and Conquer the people. Many cases have been seen in the experience of many other countries in the Middle East. Another 
My prayer and thought goes for Ukrainian people, this remind me of US invasion to my country Iraq, so sad
This is such propoganda. Russia is defending Russian speaking people from Ukrainian aggression within the Donbass,  which has been happening since the Obama/Biden Coup in 2014 which usurped legitimate Ukraine President and put Zalensky in place.  Has anyone here ever reported on the constanst shelling from Ukraine into the Donbass? Ukraine upped it this past week. Putin constantly called for an end to the shelling. Why do you think Russian speaking Citizens were evacuating the region, where do you think they were going? Donbass region has been against Zalensky and bombarded by Kiev since then, Kiev completely ignoring the Mink Agreement. NATO should not have been there and have forced Russia's hand. The West has constantly gone against every International Law since the end of WW2 and now Russia has had enough. The U.S is now 'concerned' about Ukraine when its own borders are ignored and Canada becomes a Totalitarian regime. The Bidens coincidentally have business interests in the Ukraine and have started wars since the 90's... but Russia is the bad one here??
Isn't obvious enough that there only needs to be one casualty to end this war ? Ok, maybe one plus a few assorted cronies.
Zelensky 🤡🤡
Now it happens as US and NATO provoke Russia to invade Ukraine.. where are they now?
Snipers need to take Putin out.
Time to take Putin out. Drone strike time.
What's the reason for this somebody tell me
Do nothing Biden;(
How very horrific. I am feeling and saying prayers to the citizens of Ukraine. How horrible Putin is. Cannot wait until he gets a taste of his own horrible medicine.  😔🙏😔🙏
blame blame blame. excuses excuses excuses... just admit that Pootin is a cry baby
Let it go already
Nato fooled you
Russia is cringe
Shame on u Putin
the only reality is if donald j trump was current president this wouldn't be happening.
Let's play Risk
Putin referring to Zalinsky as a Nazi is preposterous! He’s a Russian born Jew for Christ sakes!
Never trust bbc news and their fotage which was from afghanistan war.
why Russia has to do this? What has USA done in that region?
Very soon putin and his separatists will confiscate all these American weapons like Taliban and Afghanistan.
west, eu abd un shud send peace keeping force to ukraine the same tactic made by russia to invade ukraine
Adolph Hitler said he would not attack Poland and other European countries, then how come he found his way on the door steps of Britain and bombing London. Russia is doing the same .NATO and the USA must understand pacifist attitudes does not work with dictators like Putin.Europe must not make that mistake again. Independence means at times citizens have to give their lives to protect it. Ukraine is living that lesson now even if others desert you.
Orthodox Power Glory to Vlad Emperor
Perfect Putin💯🔥🔥🔥take back what's yours!!
Putin : time to invadeMilkmanshere115: stop that PutinPutin: ok ok you convinced me
Im only a teen so I dont really know much about politics but can someone explain why Russia feel threatened by Ukraine??
When will BBC also look toward Palestine... 😒😒
Probably the United States of Barbaric A Holes did the attack to make it look like Vladimir Putin. USGay is known for tactics such as this.. That's why Putin will attack USA before any place and I'm going to LOVE every moment of it especially when the USA DARPA funded one of the biggest Chemical Warfare labs in Wuhan China and then acted like they didnt know that a virus was spreading across the Globe and make Vaccinated against unvaccinated.. Well planned fella's.. You can only get away with so much before Karma KILLS YOU and I'm sure Vladimir Putin is sick of outside people that are deceitful, liars, hypocrite and people that attack themselves and claim it's a terrorist attack which US foes this more than any other place on the planet.. I'm sure Vladimir Putin like most of us are sick and tired of being lied to and poisoned throughout the last 7 decades of existence particularly.. I cant wait for him to show everyone who deserves it the KARMA that is long overdue.. THANK YOU UNIVERSE! GET THEM ALL PUTIN! At least when he does something he says its him and he has way more honesty.. Unlike the sick F's for a government over in USA.. Prepare for the eye opener you dumbed down mindless drones.. BYE BYE!
Self defence my arse😂😂🤌🏽
What a sad place call earth. You will have  lots of explaining to do when God comes for you. Smh what's the sense in that.
you have no clue what you are talking about, just another edgy kid brainwashed by russian propaganda.
russia are bullies
We don’t care about shit holes sorry
 @Bants  just like Ukraine and Us
NATO won't do a thing, dear.
My stomach is in knots!!!
Well you want to destroy his country, he gave you ur own medicine and ya don't like it that's what's happening
Ukraine give them a fight
The real battlefield 4 we all been waiting for, let’s go
This is how many families have felt for decades in the middle east
Thumbnail to get views - CNN
Enough bbc news this is the putin says your biasedhttps://youtu.be/NnGiVPAZ0CQ
Very strange too see the U.S. not to be the one doing the bombing.
Who want BBC to report on Palestine just like that..🤔🤔😢😢
He wasn’t going to hit that airport until Ukraine launched a barrage of rockets against eastern Ukraine at 4:35am Wednesday. So that doesn’t sound like an invasion.
Very sad! The  war for so called national interests!
Only God in heaven, who owns this world knows what to do with those who choose to present themselves as  enemies of the innocent souls. The battle is yours my Father! Shame and disgrace those who fight against us!
One reason - create demand for defense and weapons industry
People in power doesn't care about people's lives, they only care about their own greed.
Mexico: let’s talk about Texas?
Heart goes to civilians of western ukraine now, what about 1000s of Eastern Ukrainians being killed by Ukrainian forces? Ukrainian army considered those in dumbass region a traitors. Something we don't see in western media
This is how poor diplomacy or intent to have no diplomacy at all looks like.
How is bombing every airport, even those small ones in random villages, a measure of self-defense? And why is Putin acting like an angry orc warlord? First the Covid-19 madness and now this... what the hell is going on?!
Hope ukraine gets the support it needs
Can you expand.  I've read that he feels like NATO are expanding into Ukraine and want to surround Russia.
No one it’s a shithole curry smelly nation
Haha unlikely. This video is also a propaganda from western countries.
Proof? And what is happening in eastern Ukraine is protecting the sovereignty of the country. If the separatists don't like it there, why don't they go back to Russia?
What about the indigenous people?
How people keep believing russia. Literally lying to the world right up until they attack. Sad thing is , I can see the world letting them get away with it again. Then in a few years they do it again to another country.
No more Anglo-American domination
The president has failed...
Dear God, please destroy the evil aggressive putin
May Ukraine live on 🇺🇦
Ukraine suffered a lot with the Chernobyl disaster in 1984, and they don't deserve this! This is something that shouldn't be happening. If Russia were democratic it would not happen, because the people don't want war!! When are Russian leaders going to grow up, and realise that democracy is the only way! Eastern Europeans feel they have a new lease of life working in western Europe, and they now too believe in democracy and the eastern way is not fair to their civilians, 'cause they're treating them like children, not allowing them life opportunities.
The Western colonialist and NATO are responsible for this problem. Why were we putting Western weapons in Ukraine. The Ukrainians will be dying like dogs and the Western colonialist will not help because they are scared shitless. The Western colonialist media are still telling us lies lies lies lies lies lies lies lies lies. You threaten the 🐻🐻🐻🐻 and this is what happened. I love ❣️💕 my country men and women, and I want my government to stop making trouble around the world and help them move from living under the bridges.
If things are so bad, how come a journalist is walking around in the open talking to civilians.. Why do we in the west believe everything we are shown on the media..
From US ,I honestly didn't think this would ever happen.
This is a tragedy unfolding right before our eyes. Unfortunately it always takes tragedies for people to see. All these years since the early 1990s - this scenario has been warned about and predicted. Who in their right mind thought that Russia would accept the role assigned to them by the US ? Ignore their needs and fears. Treat them like a powerless nation. Regard them as defeated and irrelevant. The world can blame Putin for orchestrating this invasion. However nobody can say that he did not try  to cooperate and become part of their union. There were many attempts by this man. NATO, EU, cooperation against terror to name a few. All of their attempts to try to join forces had been rejected. Then came the warnings that were open and direct. They fell on deaf ears. Instead the west continued to expand regardless of sentiments of a super power that they thought was toothless.I do not believe that people in power in the US did not see this coming. Of course they did. This has all been calculated. They went ahead with their plans anyways. To them what is happening is just collateral damage. Remember this: They are far away. Europe to them is a place where they re able to see through their strategic game without being affected directly themselves. The poor civilians that are suffering are not on their radar nor in their hearts should they have any. Cold blooded calculations. I feel sorry for the civilians who are as always the ones that have to pay a high price for the disregard of people in power.
It seems the whole world is scared of one man,PUTIN. He is doing what he wants and NATO members can only hold emergency meetings.
Wake up people Screw New World Order
Why are we not blowing his city up. Where is the UN.
The only way to avoid this is to do not make any type of war weapons just people and nature after all we only wants the best and peaceful world to live in
Same as NATO promised it won't spread west from Germany.
Go, Russia!!! 🇷🇺💪
WOOOHOOOO IM READY TO WATCH THIS WORLD WAR 3 HAPPEN GOOD GAME PUTIN
Diplomacy still remains ultimate
And also everything that America touches seems to turn to shit
The Ukraine will make Russian soldiers pay for every inch gained in blood!
Nato is a papper tiger
I wish there was this much attention for Muslim countries which are going through 10x worse smh
Damn that’s crazy
agreed against the naziism of Ukraine...what they have done is genocide . i do love this channel it is the best it has direct news compared to our canadian socialist news that is bought by the government to report for the government
That crazy son on batch killing his own people
Black people of American wake up . You are shemites , not all of us but most of us are Yahwehs chosen people . You aren’t African , our Our dna is different then the people of Africa , we are a totally different type of people . This is. A distraction . Notice how this loops , notice how history retreats itself . It’s to keep you sleep . Jesus isn’t god , Yahweh is . All praise to him .

Viva Putin viva!! Fuck fake news bbc
Omg 😱
This crisis have been going on for weeks, that's why there's a immer of hope in my heart that this will just die off. But, it happens... Im not even from Ukraine but im scared big time. If Russia is successful, I have no doubt that China will be more determined to invade Taiwan.I'm just hoping now that the west, especially the US will again be a 'bastion of democracy'.
Where's the action though? It's just reporters saying their opinions. God I miss the time when we had real journalism...
Scary, horrifying and so so sad.. Putin is pure evil
I fear for this world  🌎 if a deadly virus doesn't get you a bomb or bullet will........
So sad this is happening
STOP ALL WAR, MAKE WAR ILLIEGAL
Both Ukraine and Russia plotted this to generate money! Its an act!
Bastion of Democracy...what a joke. Look what happened with the so called COVID-19 virus.
We are against ww3
Astrology says Putin will be assassinated in 2022.
Like all dictators, Putin is a liar, a thief and a coward…his name and pseudo-legacy will go down in history along side other  idiots….another tiny man with a huge inferiority complex.

look for Jehovah God people before its too late
what about when US invaded and bombed Iraq, Vietnam, Libya, Afghanistan, Syria?
Russia should be pay
The Jewish atheistic liberalism of America and Biden administration just used Ukraine as pawn against Russia.  Ukraine should not trust America and NATO and should be aligned with Russia for their existence.
Mybe the West's Regime change in 2014 does not work out well.
You're wrong.
Hey how are you doing today??
no SA supports Russia
which god? and if ukraine isn't saved, which it looks like it wont, that either means said god isn't powerful enough, doesnt care, or doesnt exist.
 @myfoodishere  imagine
 @Swyo  We are usually friendly with Russia mostly, but South Africa has condemned Russia for this.
What are we doing about this we are safe now but one day it may be us who are being drafted to defend ourselves and others
Putin, as every scumbag tyrant on this very planet, thinks this entire Earth belongs to himself.
Not sure why he wasn't assassinated along time ago
Wow bbc are suddenly against protesters being jailed
This is BS....talking crap, they showing Donetsk, and it was in 2014...as Trump said, fake news.
You know what’s scary, I’m walking around school and I I ironically hear people talking about getting drafted
Ukrainians be strong do back down.Im praying for u guys .
He is a sick man 🤮🤮🤮
L…G…B!  Putin giggles
Go Putin go ❤❤❤
War is not the solution
Putin is psycho. To hell with Ukraine not being part of NATO - we (Americans) should be there fighting. Putin must be taken to justice for his crime against humanity.
Now corona business over n investment must have started in ammunitions
So are we at war?
PrayForUkraine❤🇦🇱
Screw Soros
Is this what you really want I'm sad same human beings killing each other.
I just wonder what all these so called journalists are doing in this profession? They either know nothing about what is happening between Russia and Ukraine, or are just lying. Guys, go to Donbass and Lugansk and talk to people there. You will be rather surprised they have been waiting for Putin to come and punish those nazis from Kiev government for over 8 years now. You probably have heard nothing about it, have you? May be being a journalist is not about repeating the same fake mantra but trying to find out the truth?
Russia will destroy Cabala
This is how genocide happen in Rwanda 1994 ..whole world watching doing nothing
This is terrible man just ukrain joining NATO could cause a war I hope some country gang up on russia
... Ukraine was always strategic to both east and west and in the face of NATO encirclement even more so... The installation of puppet regimes from one side or the other isn't a long term solution as well... politically Ukraine needs to thread the needle between the interests of both sides + I am convinced it can do so and could benefit the country enormously...I only hope NATO/US and Russia will permit this...
LoL United Nations is a joke! 😂😂😂 Useless waist of money!
People in the west no everywhere need to wake up and realize that this can easily be a problem for everyone this will decide the fate of Europe but how long until this catastrophe or any other country decides to pull the same thing.. this is beyond devastating the lives lost will never be recovered the people in the west live such sheltered privileged lives that they think like something like this will never happen to them or can never affect them but everything has a cause and effect and if this goes on to full scale war the world as we know it will no longer be the same
I dont like rusia
You can see on Putin's face tye attacks aren't self defense.  The only thing he cares about defending is his own ego.
The US needs to wipe Russia from the map
War is such a primitive concept that it seems out of place in the 21 century

You play with fire 🔥 you will get burned
What a madman a crazy crazy madman you invade other nation and the reason is for your safety imbecile!!?????????? Moron!!!!!!!!!!????
No
everybody's just not gonna talk about how Putin is a piece of shit?
Or, you can just put the weapons away that can detonate in moskow in minutes and putin will stop instantly
I am praying for the civilians, such a tragedy 😔
Political Evilness,Wicked Liers Parliament ought to be Court marshalled . 🤕🇺🇦🌞🇺🇲

The point is not to die for your country it's to make them die for theirs.
Лажови Енглески! 👺✊
God bless them all. Praying for it to end quickly.
This man is clearly regretting this,He is crumbling he must step down for sake of humanity,There is no way we can sit back and watch him murder Europeans,NATO will have to go in at some point soon,He must be stopped
Uncle joes not scared. He has karmilla and popcorn to back him up
Repent to Jesus Christ ““Come, all you who are thirsty, come to the waters; and you who have no money, come, buy and eat! Come, buy wine and milk without money and without cost. Why spend money on what is not bread, and your labor on what does not satisfy? Listen, listen to me, and eat what is good, and you will delight in the richest of fare. Give ear and come to me; listen, that you may live. I will make an everlasting covenant with you, my faithful love promised to David. See, I have made him a witness to the peoples, a ruler and commander of the peoples. Surely you will summon nations you know not, and nations you do not know will come running to you, because of the Lord your God, the Holy One of Israel, for he has endowed you with splendor.” Seek the Lord while he may be found; call on him while he is near. Let the wicked forsake their ways and the unrighteous their thoughts. Let them turn to the Lord, and he will have mercy on them, and to our God, for he will freely pardon. “For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways,” declares the Lord. “As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts. As the rain and the snow come down from heaven, and do not return to it without watering the earth and making it bud and flourish, so that it yields seed for the sower and bread for the eater, so is my word that goes out from my mouth: It will not return to me empty, but will accomplish what I desire and achieve the purpose for which I sent it. You will go out in joy and be led forth in peace; the mountains and hills will burst into song before you, and all the trees of the field will clap their hands. Instead of the thornbush will grow the juniper, and instead of briers the myrtle will grow. This will be for the Lord’s renown, for an everlasting sign, that will endure forever.””‭‭Isaiah‬ ‭55:1-13‬ ‭NIV‬‬
Not Good! Isn't this the same principle, as UK had with the Falklands?
Poland is open to refugees.  Putin is attempting to say they're not. Poland is trying to take in Ukraine citizens.
Under Biden this could be the US, and no guns
Russia will die for this one
I can’t believe this can happen in 2022. Putin will go to hell. Killing innocent people
How can this guy say that if Russia occupies Ukrainian will be as if Nazi’s occupied…..Ukraine was and is Nazi county……..it’s not even a secret
So sad there's still war going on. To many precious life's lost. I hope we learn asap not to repeat history!
USA and NATO = Anti-Christ Army
I’m feeling sorry for the ordinary people! Ukrainian people should ask themselves, where are those banderas now? They hide now and ordinary people suffer
🥺🥺🥺
That's the Airport where the big Antonov 225 is kept. Now seized by the Russians.
Putin is trying to be the catalyst for world war 4.
THE Sum of All Fears is a USA AWACS or Fighter Jet .. knocked out of the Air by a Stinger - S.A.M - Drone - Laser Weapon .. or New Russian Cloaked Air Defense System .. then we will get pulled through the Mud and Into the Fire .. Many Fear .. The USA being pulled in to this Invasion .. Like a Mom dragging a Child to the Dentist for the First Time !
WOKES, LIBERAL LIARS, GLOBALISM, CANCEL CULTURE, LGBTQ, ETC IS GOING DOWN👍
Ukrainian. Dont run. Help yor army to fight back. Win. Lost fight For victory.
I’m literally sick to my stomach looking at this
Everyone knew Putin was a pos dictator but now he's using Hitler's playbook.  May he personally pay dearly for this.
Absolute dolts showing how Russian police are arresting protesters. Australia experienced worse than  that the last two years and your useless media did and said nothing. All bull$h1+ propaganda
why invade a country when ur the biggest country in the world?
There's a baldie ugly piece of junk from Russia. The biggest coward after Hitler.
Shouldn't of joined NATO
Joey:
Putin has declared war on Nato, Ukraine is the first step to Europe.
just waited for the Skaters to finished
one of the most corrupt governments in the world is Ukraine. All the lies from the media will not make Ukraine look good. Half of the Ukraine government and military  are Fascists Nazi
Elected governments are false fronts coordinated by a global shadow government:National governments pretend independent motives while enacting a scripted version of world events.The global shadow government, also known as the New World Order or illuminati, consists of human elite directed by hyperdimensional and cryptoterrestrial forces who seek total domination over mankind. These human elite are assigned the task of enslaving the rest of mankind and then handing over control to their nonhuman superiors. Because such individuals are hungry for power anyway, they have no reservations about enslaving those beneath them.To consolidate this power, world events are scripted toward creating conditions that rationalize the increasing removal of freedom and independence from nations and individuals. Wars, civil wars, and revolutions provide this catalyst. In the future, earth cataclysms and an overt alien invasion will be used toward these ends.
What ever you say we not trust BBC bullshitting...
So many hate this country it could happen here
Americans southern border???MSM *crickets
The only Nazi is the one who invaded
Vlad the Emperor
Somebody needs to put a stop  to Putin. My prayers go to the Ukranian people and army.
My heart bleeds for these people. May God help Ukrainians and all the people helping them.
It is really heartbreaking!hope Ukrainian stay safe and strong
Let's add Ukrain to the long list of countries invaded and occupied by self serving superpowers. Prayers for the millions of innocent who have already been through this along with the Ukrainian people who are experiencing it now.
Here we go again😥😫
I blame every soldier who followed orders to invade an innocent country as much as Putin himself.
Tricks used by world manipulators include Hegelian dialectics and false dichotomies. Hegelian dialectics is better known as problem-reaction-solution, whereby a problem is created to push people into accepting a rigged solution. Incidents such as the Oklahoma City bombing, Columbine massacre, and 9/11 attacks were engineered by the shadow government to justify the further removal of freedoms from the populace to “keep them safe.” Ultimately, liberty traded for security leads to slavery.
My heart goes to Yemeni children that have been bombed for years with the U.K. manufactured bombs….
A new Adolf Hitler is here. I just hope it doesn't go as far as with the first one.
Destroy Cabala
Communication and transportation hubs and military sites are all on fire by now.
Then every American soldier NATO soldier uk soldier should be blame for the destruction they brought upon middle east aswell. They are innocent country too...
BBC why don't you report the truth behind the Russian Ukraine war?? Northern Ukraine is mostly Russian people from prior when the land was taken from Russia. I wish you corrupt media would for once tell the truth! Unfortunately, you most likely been paid off. Just like CNN, Global News, MSNBC well most large media organizations. As one is taught, follow the money trail, Unfortunately most people enjoy lies rather than the truth!
BBC MAKE STORY AGAIN .
3rd european war near the corner !!! NATO VS  Russia-China alliance !!!  Hummmm. What next after Russia invasion ??? More war or more peace?
Stop calling Putin a president. He is a dictaking dictator
Absolutely horrific and cowardly evil Putin, my thoughts go out to all the Ukrainians. Terrifying
Zelenskiy, you haven't been building anything. You and the jewranian oligarchs have done nothing else than stealing from the Ukrainian people and the territory.
Where the fuck is nato now? Provoke Russia and get away with it, they are digging their own grave, I mean where the fuck is NATO, why aren't they helping Ukraine now,
Putin didn't even pay a price for MH17.  Failure to hold Putin to account only further emboldened him.
USA = Illuminati
Where is NATO ...?  What innocent women, she thought NATO or US protect her? No one interested in fighting with Russia and find itself with nuclear war. It is Ukraine regime who want it ,now he got it.
God Damn It !!
This exact feeling we had in the year 1999 when the USA with NATO had started the air bombing campaign on Serbia and Montenegro.  When the sirens went off and the bombs started dropping. The same thing was done, an invasion and annexation of a province, Kosovo, from a sovereign country. These NATO members now are being hypocritical. There are countless other examples, Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan, Palestine, and so on… i‘m not with Russia on this one, tho i‘m not with NATO either.
This is beyond me 🥺 so sad ... my heart is heavy 😔
Christ Army (Russia) VS Anti-Christ Army (USA and NATO)
i find it so annoying that politicians argue and they get young troops to sacrifice their lives for their own mistakes they have made. why dont the politicians get off their asses and fight for their own country instead of having innocent people die on their behalf.
pray for all soldierspray for all people pray for the childrenpray for the animalspray for everyone🙏🙏🙏may peace be with them
BBC stoking the fire
Would love to know where my stupid country stands. We have massive protects when Israel defends its self from Palestinians. But nothing about this lol yeah the 2 faced world we live in.  Nato the mayo doing nothing about this sanctions are a joke has done nothing much
He's not a coward. He didn't create BS excuse such as finding weapon of mass destruction or terrorist or invading for human rights excuses like what the US or NATO does when they invaded middle east. He's far better than any president america had for the past 7 decades...
Because given that the man in the kremlin is insane any direct military action from NATO can go very easily into a nuclear war. There are no winners when that happens.
 @GamerKat'71  then why Biden and his boys escalated the situation by blabbering that they are going to help Ukraine in situation like this, if they didn't wanted war than they should not have been provoking towards Russian, 
Ukraine isn't a member of NATO, so NATO members are under no obligation to help it.
It's okay when USA and NATO bomb countries! They are world heroes after all! Everyone else however, are aggressors.
 @Ana  that's how West media works
But only NATO has the manpower and weaponry to stop the Russians, like them or not.
Christ never advocated violence and war. This war is anti-Christ
 @Pix_d  Do not think that I came to bring peace on earth. I did not come to bring peace but a sword.
Germany opposes cutting off Russia from SWIFT as well as sending weapons to Ukraine. Germany supports Russia. Germany wants to do business with Russia. Any talk about 
🇷🇺❤️👍Gogogo Russia
In the future, the United States and NATO will face military challenges from Russia and China, and only relying on the help of NATO countries in Europe will not be able to stop the territorial expansion ambitions of the belligerent leaders of Russia and China.  It is time for the United States and NATO to seriously consider allowing Japan, South Korea, Israel, Australia and India to join NATO.
Russia had no choice.now let China take over Tia wan. Thank President Biden and NATO Farther GOD protect Russia in Christ Jesus holy name.Amen🙏😃 take over Poland to.
Владимир Владимирович путин, покажи свою силу!
NATO going against a signed treaty with Russland that they will not go further east 🤷‍♂️
Stop nato. It is not PC game.
Coming from all directions 🥺 the air raid sirens are so unsettling, how are people supposed to stay calm? The poor children going to have stressed hearts before they are even old enough to understand 😢
Hitting the airport is nothing short of a attempt to stop the civilians leaving.
Sad he will also kill his own people if they protest against him
Why??? Just why?!
NATO ._. Do something
In war there's no winner only losses, defeat, catastrophic my grandparents experience world war 2 . Humans never learned.
This is a war no one wants! NATO should have honoured agreements made under Gorbachev and then Yeltsin and Ukrainian government should not pressed for membership of the North Atlantic Trade Organisation but like always men in power weather it's Putin, Biden or any other WEF puppet just don't give a . . . . . when it's only the common man that surfers from their game of greed
What a waste to read all comments: how sad bless Ukraine and our thoughts are with them. These days we have become so weak. We should send troops, whatever the cost is. It's not just about Ukraine, it's about Russia and china try to become a new world power. Whatever happens, we should fight back. It's a disgrace how we are standing by.
I'm a little irritated that no-good busy Buddies. That woman makes a comment that they Ukrainian soldiers should surrender. They weren't the ones that started it and invaded Russia
India Japan Australia Israel and SK are not that powerful they can't compete to China Russia and Iran. All the countries you listed depends on US fundings.
No there was not such treaty. Why do you still lie so brazenly about stuff like that? Its pointless not. THe mask has fallen

 @Dundoril  read what I said not read into what you think I said.
This is the scariest thing that I have witnessed I am shaking God bless, -uno reverse 🙏
Remember, The Truth is always the first casualty of war.
WTF IS HAPPENING ARE WE IN WW3?
That’s what happens when you threaten a countries safety. Blame NATO. I feel for the innocent Ukrainians. Don’t blame Putin, he’s protecting his people. Media is full of shit. BBC criminals.
Doesn’t anyone remember when Hitler attacked Poland?  Eerily similar…..
How come they’re able to just roll into the country? Along with their statement hat it’s defense because russia can’t survive their attacks if they wanted to take down russia. Well that sounds really backwards, and exactly what the ukraines should be saying. So fuck off putin
What is currently happening in Ukraine, has been instigated, orchestrated and fed and by the sociophatic, war mongering US neocons - AND the imbecile, tail wagging US lap dog war criminal Jens Stoltenberg, a de facto traitor to not only his own country Norway, but to the whole of Europe! . . .In its 242-year history, America has enjoyed only 16 - SIXTEEN years of peace, making it the most aggressive, bullying, cheating, stealing, lying and warmongering nation in the history of the planet . . .Until Ukraine: Mother Russia has had enough!
I thought Brandon was going to prevent this from happening?I thought I heard him say he was an expert in foreign policy🤔I knew Russia would not take this weak administration seriously.Yet another disaster just like Afghanistan.😡
In Process: MaskirovkarThe intentions of the biden administration, to create a bloodbath in ukraine and wear down russia seem to be diluted at this moment by Putin's masterful move, by sending troops to ukraine and thus stopping the bloodbath orchestrated by the west and sending the meat grinder to the Ukrainian soldiers on a front so vast impossible to defend.rAll the ground lost so far by Ukraine cannot be recovered and will be used against them in the negotiations, despite the fact that the Ukrainian army has adopted the western military doctrine with the creation of a special force (2% of the army 99.,72,140' Etc.) and improving since 2014 the anti-tank defense Corsar and Stugna-P, Javelin (Usa), N-Law (UK), targeting (Ballistic Calculators and drones and some Bayraktar TB2 which is an unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) medium altitude and long endurance) and long range artillery 2S19 Msta-S, (Vilkha-M, Neptune Sub-Variant (Anti-Ship Missile, if these are not enough it may lose its way out to sea if Odessa falls) and Some Polish Dragon fly Marauding Munitions ), but they are still vulnerable to Russian counter-battery fire due to their low mobility (If you can stop the Russian armored mass, you can contain it with mortars and machine guns, you will win on the ground the problem is that there are very few anti-tank missiles one is available for every 10 km), in short, at this moment, Russia is only showing its fangs when it sees that Ukraine and the West do not stop the escalation and there is no real will to pacify the next attack, it would be preventive and does not have purely military objectives, cyberattacks, targeted attacks on infrastructure, limited use of long-range artillery strikes to destroy Ukrainian army magazines, although the line of defense is deep, which implies that Russia must launch its battalions and divisions in a conventional war and then surround the ukrainian army, everything seems to indicate that the next objective would be Kharkov (aircraft attack and VDV paratroopers), right now all the ukrainian units are being directed towards the donbass, which opens the possibility for russia to attack on such a wide front and implies that the mobility of the ukrainian army is effective which is unlikely, the most likely objective of all this action is to win in little or more time on the ground, surrounding Kiev (Belarussian front) would be the second probable front, it would be equivalent to capturing the Ukrainian center of gravity and forcing negotiations under favorable conditions for Russia that guarantee its security and a special status for the Donbass area, a 
Problem, solution, slavery - government refresh control
Wow.... this is just shocking and terrible. Never expected this...
Biden is a complete disaster - praying for these poor people in Ukraine - heartbreaking.
God save the civilians because the Russians won't
He will step on to many peoples toes.Stay safe ukraine our hearts are with you.Nato is close behind x
There are videos showing international war crimes of missiles hitting near where civilians are living. Putin needs to be hanged for those crimes. China and Russia need the rest of the world and they are distancing themselves more and more. Russia has been cut off from 4 currencies presently. What are they going to do when that becomes 30?
USA is Illuminati
My thought are genuinely with Russia and red army. Pray for Russia red army
Fuck NATO
9hrs... 4.5million views. Hang in there guys, the future is rough
NO it hasnt. Unless you think that Putin is controlle by thE US
Prayers to all the great folks in Ukraine and May God find our countries guts and honor to go stop this MAD MAN before it goes any longer we need to stop Russian power now or pay for it in the end with our lives and lands in our country. he is mad and will not quit till we stop him
Of course the poor people of Kiew feel they all are targets, they've been playing those sirens every hour all day without real reason, just to spread fear and panik. The fights are not even near there yet, but can you imagine hearing this horrible sound all day long... It's not in Putin's interest to attack civil population, his own land will stand up against him if he does, they are shocked and totally against war even now, not to mention the Ukranians, he will have no chance whatsoever if they see blood and stand up. And he knows that.
In Process:21022022  Local War according to the criteria of the Russian military doctrine, softening of the Ukrainian defenses with a preparatory attack of 3 to 4 hours (Short will depend on the intelligence on the ground) and followed by a ground attack, Kalibr missiles have been used for this operation, the first objectives are logistics centers, infrastructure, apparently the ground advance is very fast, which implies thousands of casualties for the Russian army, but acceptable according to its doctrine, costs are naturally high, but it will reach its objectives quickly , thus avoiding a war of attrition and with very high political costs, all analysis is unpredictable since the axis of Russian advance (Kiev?) is unknown, it is not known if there are attacks in Mariúpol (Port City), terrain not very extensive easy to defend with few pieces of artillery of 155 mm (2S22 Bohdana), and it is not yet confirmed if Kharkov, which is the second city of importance, is being besieged a city 20 km from the fro but apparently it will not be defended or has been neutralized (the morale of the Ukrainian army should be reviewed, remember the very high number of desertions in the past), which implies that the local war does not make a difference, armed conflict is being exploited in all fronts by the russian army, meanwhile the ukrainian troops have been prepared and strengthened on the donbass front, just like in 2014 and this is a war of movement, of maneuver every inch of lost ground cannot be recovered and will will use in the negotiations something that ukraine cannot afford, as always a war with civilian costs with accomplices on all sides.
Ukraine never ever threatened russia and ukraine is a free country.putin has lost his mind and is paranoid and delusinal🇮🇱🇺🇦🇺🇸
a 
Soon we will see the clowns in Kiev somewhere in Poland as refugees of war. FSLN
Alien agenda, more technologies on shops soon
Putin is looking like the new Hitler.
Can we just have a normal MF Year?
Freaking psychopath he is
This is such a pathetic moved.. Russia is totally desperate of powers.
War is not the capacity of a comedian, at the expense of the people to come forward while the officials and the president laugh at each other. This war happened because a comedian pretended to be a hero.  Wake the sleeping Bear to play with fireworks
Russia will destroy Cabal Nation (USA)
I am so worried about the stray animals and pets Oh Allah please help everyone in Ukraine please we beseech in the name of Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him)Please protect all civilians & animals and pet i am so scared and i am so sorry that this is happening in 2022 to innocent people and animals in Ukraine by evil RussiaMy heart goes out to everyone suffering in Ukraine Kashmir Palestine Yemen Ghaza Sirya Lots of prayers love & support from Pakistan❤
Ukraine must be punished
A two-bit tinpot of a third-rate petro state!
We need to kill these mfers with absolute power they start to think they're god
🙏🙏🙏stop war🙏
HMMM Operation Merciful Angel what about civilians than ? NATO ?
Believe me NATO wants this war also!!!
I gurrentee there are more who want liberated...BBC is owned by te far left so not going to get a unbiased opinion
If Ukraine manages to resist Russian conventional forces, I would not put it past Putin to use his nuclear arsenal
Russian economy will be crippled for years and years so what's the point!
F*CK RUSSIA
Obviously no resistance in sight from the Ukraine threat that Putin justified as his excuse to invade
RIP LUCKY DUBE ONE PEOPLE JUST DIFFERENT COLORS BLACK LIVES MATTER 💪💪💪💪💪NO WAR UKRAINE ❤RUSSIA
Can not believe what that’ monster called Vladimir Putin is doing. Ruining with a nation and  bringing the whole world into a such bad position.
I want to say Russian don't have heart. Idiot
It reminds me of when they invade Iraq in the pretext of WMD
“Nazi occupation” Bruh you have Nazis among you’re ranks the fuck?
What the fuck!!? Self defense???are you serious mr president??You are the one ordering the attack to Ukraine who doesn’t attack you at first !! You’re starting a war and you’re using it as a way to invade Ukraine !! As south East Asian I don’t have trust to you anymore I thought you’re not that kind of president but you are !! For real!! Poor civilians
Bombs for the poor,sanctions for the rich
We should of continued East after WW2 and crushed Moscow before they got nukes
as a Chinese,  i stand with 🇺🇦，i pray for the people in ukraine.
After a failed talked. How can you expectRussia not to move?
Well, there are Nazi's in Ukraine, just like in Germany itself even the USA. So, Putin will feel justified risking WW3 with this rash, dangerous action. I hope NATO has more restraint and wisdom than he's shown here, or we are all dead, all of humanity will be doomed.
This is wrong on so many levels.
Communism is evil!
Screw Soros
Holy shit! We now see that Putin was not delivering empty threats. FSLN
Why why why so sad 😭
S6to ani delajut.bagatije sedat I komandirujut v teple tolka dumajut a dengas I kulturu a kto terpet prastiji ludi
Biden and Hunter business Buddies are on the run lol  Russia put missiles in Cuba we didn't like it. Ukraine was asking to be part of NATO and that would have put NATO troops on Putin's porch.
Long live Russia
They got some of their footage from “snap maps” on Snapchat, that is great. They can get reporting footage from locals snapchat stories using the hot spots on snapchats snap map feature. That is interesting and kinda funny
Weapons is not answering
God don’t kill ppl normally. Ppl kill ppl. It’s sad 😞. Hope peace will come to the world! 🙏🙏🙏
What the fuck was the sound at the end. It gave me headache
I’m coming back to this comment section 20 yrs if we still alive
Save 🌎earth  no war 🙏
I hate 🇷🇺 go usa kill the president of 🇷🇺🇷🇺
You are fake news 👎Evil creation .
USA = IlluminatiUSA is Jew loving Nation
God bless Russia
Western MSM. Gotta love the bias. America and the west have NO MORAL HIGH ground to tell other nations what to do.
O no world War 3
Just when you think we are finally out of the covid pandemic that ravaged world we are now face with this. We don't need this now, I hope everyone in Ukraine stay safe
How can a leader like Putin, you not go to the fight or war,  but you use people with your authority to killing people, you make people leave their peace and comfort where the civilian. Putin you not fight.
Everyone is equal. Race, religion, nationality, all deserve to be loved.
Donald Trump praises Putin.
Heroshima and Nagasaki who did to civilians?
The globalists are at fault, they have kept humanity enslaved for 1400 years, way too long..wake up to the truth..you're being lied to..wake up!
Lord please touch the heart of all the leader and army to stop this war..My prayers to all.
Ukraine's people are being liberated from a repressive government playing DANGEROUS regional politics behind NATO.
They say ukraine is a corrupt nation. Ukraine should have never tried to be a separate country they belong to Russia
You know those guys on the tanks are just going to go into Opry home and f**** slaughter them too this is so not right who would want a war during this time this is so f*** up
Thats the way it always is....
we have to see history why Ukraine is being attacked...
Sorry Ukraine,and let's not forget the innocent Russians that don't want war !
I taught we were in the 21st century?? No one told we’re back to 1940…

Screw Gates Screw Soros
Pandemics, wars, aaaaahhh! Human beings we can do better 😞
Now is the physical beginning of world war three. The great bear that comes from the North. Korea or Iran will launch the first nuke as they are the pawns. While Russia and China are the King And Queen
Truly upsetting for a country and it’s people to suffer like this and be under attack for no reason, I hope the people stay strong and Russia gets it’s deserved consequences ❤️
@Volodymyr Zelensky, if the life of your people is trully important for you... Forget your ambition and politics... Just Surrender... All of this is your fault!!!!
Putin and Trump are a threat to democracy
Like Netnyahoo bombing Palestinians a bit ago, like Syria, like all these wars on terror, it's be wise to look at the BELT&ROAD, and Israel's role in world terror & partnership with Russia & China, Putin wants his empire bigger just like Israel! And America is just stupid, infiltrated, & bows to AIPAC...
Russia and China know their economies at the blink of collapse and they are in a desperate coordinated attempt to drag the world into a WW3.
Not In 2022 This  Cannot Be Real !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Why Don't All Of These Countries Help Everyone Ese Who Have Nothing !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Go Putin Go, the Cabal must fall..
Putin won’t be forgiven
China is laughing
USA is Jew Nation
It's not real guys it's just a show don't you realise that after the whole plandemic
so what happened with covid ?  all the refugees has the fizer shots ? vaccination card ? they cant pass borders without vaccs or negative tests ,  oh no wait its a war it doesnt matter now I see
Putin must pay!
World leaders knew this was coming for years and did nothing. Shouldn’t pretend to care now, especially when they will do nothing real to help Ukraine
For no reason? You delusional kid.
I wonder what white ppl get for starting every major world war?Do they get their deserved consequences? Because they haven't yet. Smh.
Yes thats the relevant part now...
Get sick and recover or be killed by bombs hmmm. Which is the best choice to you? Don't be stupid.
Self defence??? What a sick monster he is!!!
I feel sad about the news. I pray and hope this ends and for someone to help them.
My heart breaks for them.  We all must pray for them🙏🏻🙏🏼🙏🏽🙏🏾🙏🏿
so sad bro :)
For evil to triumph is for good to do nothing. This has to stop and everyone should have coordinated response against Putin
in 2022 after the pandemic now this like we need more innocent people dying smh 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
We Russians will not back down for anyone blood for blood
For weeks members of the Russia subreddit mocked Biden for telling the world Putin would attack Ukraine any day. Well, Biden was right, and last time I looked, the subreddit had gone private. I hope you're all satisfied with yourselves.
Putin 🔔🔚 😉
Powerful nation bullying the weaker ones instead of helping them to grow. So barbaric and disgusting🤮
Can’t someone take out putin?...I’m asking for a friend
There is no democracy. Covid and it's Globalist Elite has made that very clear. Everything that occurs must happen for the return of the Messiah is fulfilled and Satan is thrown to the depths of hell
Let’s all pray the war can be over
Putin, you're showing the lunatic side of you for saying this was in self defense; this is totally ridiculous, I would have kept that stupid response to myself if I was you!!! The actions of another tyrant in the world!!!
Screw George Soros
Now that people will be hiding underground, and don’t forget COVID still exists so people might get sick in there and die
Please promote the helping groups with hundreds of people willing to help the refugees - United for Ukraine.
Who`s ready to fight for ukraine if we have to? i sure as shit will
:-(
Lmao what is that clickbait thumbnail?!!!!! Y’all can do better than that, stop it!!!!!!
Russia map update, download 603548 megabytes ? ❤️🇷🇺❤️
Sad how the same situation has been going on syria, afghanistan but because it was by the US it doesnt get attention such bullshit
Where is American this is realty of NATO and American
To be fair President Putin should have announced the day before that he was going to attack at 9:34 a.m. at Stalin and Leonard Street
War war war are boy this might be world War 3
I hope that one of Putin's innercircle members takes him out.
NATO is Illuminati's tool and should be destroyed
Their tank drivers seem to have had one to many vodka and cranberries based off her driving skills.
Why can't we help Ukraine?? Just asking
When the US invaded Iraq for oil the nato and all its citizens were quite they infact joined the war and destroyed Iraq and Middle East forever. Now that Russia is doing the same the hypocrites of west is on their high horse of moral and talking abouts lives and rights. Also the west could always deescalate the possibility of war but chose not to . Still as everyone here talks about their hearts here is my useless 
All you narcissists with the fake sympathy “My Heart…” I can 1000% guarantee the Ukrainian people don’t give a fuck about your heart. It’s unbelievable how stupid you people are. If you really actually care and physically hurting for them. Go fight with them. Yeah, didn’t think you would.
The dictator Putin does that to hide his corruption and keeps his chair
Oh God. Touch the heart of this leaders. In a war only civilians are victims. Let there be peace. So sad there is PANDEMIC AND WAR.
I can't understand Russian military personnel, many of them have families and deep connections in and with Ukraine
Gambia should help Ukraine.
Russian soldiers will face the partisan of Ukrainians just as they did with Nazi Germany and internal Russian cities will also feel the heat with internal explosions.Welcome Putin to the New Afghanistan War.
Pakistan stands with Ukraine we love Ukraine
This literally just happened. They can't just teleport there with no information. Don't be stupid. And the US isn't the only country in NATO. There's 29 other countries apart of it.
That's because there's different people in power now than when the invasion on Iraq happened. This may be shocking to you, but not everyone in a country thinks the same way. The newer people in power do not share the beliefs of the people back then. The invasion was actually done by one of, if not THE, most hated presidents in the US.
 @Mousy Eidolon Right. A crappy president does not entirely equate to a crappy people.
Gambia wtf?
What can a shithole country like that achieve
I think his job is the last thing the Ukraine president is worried about ffs. What kind of journalism is that?!
guys please pray for a diplomatic resolution very soon
Pray for Ukraine, pray for the war to end.
Russia must be destroyed once and for all.
Very sad to see this and very ashame for Putin to kill innocent people.Putin lost his intelligence with this war.
Ukraine will have to resort to guerilla warfare. It's the only way to force the Russian troops to leave, when enough mothers lose sons to a war that could have been avoided. This war will pit brother against brother given there's many families that span both countries.
Be strong and listen to those who fear for their safety so that this situation does not happen 🙏
RUSSIA #1
Whatever the media and military says about these trillion dollar jets being an aid to border protection, is apparently a crock.
Ok Europe it’s in your backyard? Y’all go a head and give up, shame on the west
We need to take out russia and its dictator for good
Bomb England
I was on snap map and looked over at Ukraine and there was a video of a column of Ukrainian troops marching and the caption deadass said back again with the boys 💀
If humans are so smart how come we never learn that war only benefits the few while the masses suffer?? My only wish is that when nukes destroy the the world I hope it takes the elite with them! Funny how when the world starts to unite a war conveniently starts that will cause more devision with the public! Sorry but I don't believe any of this b.s propaganda that the media are spinning they have lied to us for 2 years what makes u think they telling the truth now???🤔
Russia is shit! Shame!!!
why wont putins army kill him? i always wondered that about the nazi soldiers with hitler. like they cant all be for it.
Propaganda by the USA govermafia! It's a staged fight! It's fake. The first thing you would do is knock out power, fuel, roads, then go after metropolitan areas, Russia is testing missiles in the open country.  Putting sanctions on Russia is useless, they are self sustainable.  It's the USA that wants the region for the natural resources. Oil, gas, forestry, land, etc!!!
Tyrant deserves whatever consequences he gets from the international community!
I agree with the russian lady with the child, this is not a war by the words of the people, but politicians, biden, putin.
Seems like USA can only fight those who  any fight back
What did Ukraine do???
Whats the sympathy ? NATO levelled one of the Europian capitals - Belgrade (Serbia) in '99. At least Russians are currently blasting military infrastructure but NATO , without UN Security Council approval , shelled everything in Belgrade. From hospitals to kindergardens. Glory to Russia for not dancing to the Western tunes. Putin is not killing civilians. Also Kosovo is taken from the Serbia by the West , the exact same way Russia took Crimea from Ukraine. Double standard much !?
my heart goes out to the people of Ukraine. God please help those people. i pray for all  Ukraine people.
Let’s hope North Korea doesn’t get involved
1:42 there's still Nazis in Ukraine?
Praying 🙏 for safety of everyone ,specially the innocent ones
BULLSHIT BROADCASTING CORPORATION!!!!
Europe is next
Why is no one taking this fool out? Prayers for all affected by this senseless action.
deNazification my ass. He's the Nazi. Crimea was Sudetenland.This is 15 March 1939
PHCKNG LYING BSBBC... liars... garbage false news.
Im sad for ukraine, but feel more hate for russia
Whatever
This is  sick pro war propaganda I'm serious this a insane farce and a complete miscarriage of the truth u people are disgusting to push for the continued increase  to  crisis  by making it a look like it's one sided when it's clearly not and how having European observer's in the to monitor the fighting between them and the 2 breakaways and not once did it's presence abate the of nearly constant violation to the Minsk Accord  nor did it try to calmly try and draw them away to negotiate for the full settlement of hostile actions between them and the it's  NATO or nothing B.s.
💩💩💩🤮🤮poten
Stop it. No more boogie men.
All allies need to help now and stop putin. All other countries need to help these people in any way we can.
Wait russian attacks ukraine's civilians? thats war crime !!!
As Biden once said!
So heartbreaking.. the people are the one’s suffering from this. 💔🥺😔
Пизда вам материна натовска и вама долази крај! Живела Русија и Руски народ! 🇷🇺❤
World 3 has just begun 😭😭😭😭 🤦‍♀️
Unkraine   should surrender   and  save  their  people.  Surrender  and they will save  their  cities  from  destruction.   The president of  Ukraine  is  killing his  own  people   because  of  his  arrogance.   Surrender  and  save  LIVES.
Europe is Russian colony
Shame on the Poten
FFSgdueehfjdjrhfhfhfhdgdgdhfhfjfjejjfhgjejFFShdhfhdgdggfhehfho
We need the Irish provisionals 🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪
Russia has an isolated economy.  As such, to a certain degree, they'll be able to survive sanctions.  But now, they'll be marginalized for decades.  Same for Belarus.  China may throw them a lifeline, but it will be limited.  China will be calling Russia's shots going forward.
Puttin stuck in his old ways so so bad older he gets the more nuts he becomes. Cut him off from the world as Germany should cut trade. Russias own people will be hurt too sad sad 😞    Puttin rich guy nothin better to do you are not a president to your country at all
Only the paranoid survives. Feelings are useless without  the means to implement them.
When America and its NATO Allies invaded Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Egypt, and Syria no one bats an eye, its like people are in favor of these warmongers. But now that Russia wants to defend its country and territory against the encroaching forces of NATO and US in guise of Ukranian democracy, everbody is suddenly accusing Putin as the aggressor and a monster in the making. What a bunch of hypocrites.Go ahead Putin, do what you need to do. And if needed, drop your nuclear weapon to America and its Allies. Erase them all on the face of the earth. 🤣
I smell a World War 3 😭
as long as the world is plaqued by governments like russia and china there will always be smaller countries invaded and civilians murdered unless the rest of the world removes them. you will be next. keep that in mind while you do nothing to get rid of the worlds scum.
My heart is with Ukraine ♥️🥰♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
This is the consequence of the US trying to add Ukraine into NATO and militarize it against Russia. US didn’t and doesn’t care about Ukrainian citizens as long as they’re the most dominant bully but Russia doesn’t let it happen. Meanwhile, it’s the Ukrainian civilians and soldiers who lose most. Current Ukrainian president is also a US puppet. He’s shouldn’t have sided with the West if he couldn’t stand a chance with Russia. He thought the west would help but they won’t. My heart goes out to Ukrainians and Russian who lost their lives and peace
Need to kill Russia
Vlad the Emperor
I know it isn't likely Ukraine will make it, but fuck Russia. If war ends up escalating, I wish to bring terror on Russia, just as they keep trying to do.
It's not fair. Why should people suffer and DIE because of Putin's relentless desire for supremacy? You call that peacemaking; unifying people with similar roots and so called family? I'm not buying it.
No, not the people. Someone needs to tell the leaders about themselves.
The west and American governments are hypocrites for allowing a coward, terrorist and animal (Putin) to do as he please for invading a democratically free country (Ukraine) he must to be held accountable for war crime.
Hffgfffghshdghjdhdgshjdjsuhfhrjjdgffh
Russia is only responding to years of aggression from nato, yet they are still painted as the bad guy, all Ukraine had to do was deny their invitation into the nato alliance and this wouldn’t be happening. Their leadership brought this upon themselves. They could’ve chosen to stay neutral but no.
thank you for your words of support, of course.  Though so sorry, you are generous with words only. Greetings from Kiev.
I hope it gets better
This is a diplomatic failure of the West
Why dont they put land mine bfore they ran away the border?
Good for the media war isn’t it
Dont remember seeing so much sympathy from people when middle east got blown to bits by the US, whatever fits your agenda i guess
My prayer goes out to people in Ukraine  who lost their lives, children, parents, husband, wife, the Love Ones in their life.This is just awfulLet this be over PLEASE!!
One upon a time in...Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, Yamen, Palestine, Afghan and etc. My memories. Salam.
Orthodox Power Glory to Vlad
The chess pieces are being played.
Surrender before you lose everything
The end of the world is near!
pizdesh
The war has been going on for years, stop the fake news
While these sickos behind the suit sit and be entertained by this
Our prayers go out to Ukraine
Yes ♥️♥️♥️
It has been scientifically proven that prayers don't work.
 @Paul Furey  shut
 @Paul Furey  It has been scientifically proven that your science doesn’t work. But no worries, one day the God of this world will come again and you can tell him the he’s not scientific enough for you.
 @Paul Furey  Prayer is not a thing, it is comfort, message to those that we are here for them
does that include the people in donbas or is that not ukraine anymore?
 @Bao’s Dad  yes. War is stupid. It does not solve your problem it just creates more problems.
BBC reporter's words are farts
 @Mor Ho  for everyone in the area suffering from this war.
 @bilibili东风速递  what do you mean?
Prayers? Lol
If prayers really works people praying for their safety then suddenly war happends. How Ironic
Just like the people of Palestine,Afghanistan,Libya and many other countries that destroyed because they don't want to share there oil
We have nothing to do. NOTHING WE CANT STOP IT and we Cant WE HOPE AND HOPE it it might come true but...It is just the start...:( I hope everything gets better though....😭😭😭
 @Paul Furey  thats rude you are basically saying god is not real well you aren’t real- .....you are but you are not taking this seriously TAKE IT SERIOUSLY THERE ARE PEOPLE BEING KILLED!!!😩
 @cuc  Its an American thing even in the Philippines they try to get our resources. And keep on using UN to keep force us to follow them.
This shit remind me of modern warfare 2.
Is there any safe country for civilians nowadays? Let’s see if the international laws are really effective.
There is more to it than being told. Putting is a smart man.  Nato is ruining nations and he is not going to let them in his back yard. He has an agenda and Biden has let it happen. Funny how burisima and the uk gas deal Biden kid was involved in may be destroyed. Funny how that works? I smell a stinky fish.
THIS GUY IS MAD, IF NOT STOPPED IT COULD ESCALATE, INTO ARMAGEDDON, YOU HAVE SEEN HIS OWN PEOPLE DONT WANT THIS FIGHT, THIS IS MAFIA TACTICS AND LIES FROM PUTIN, AND HES USING THE THREAT OF ATTACK ON RUSSIA WHICH IS UNTRUE, TO GO AHEAD WITH THIS MADNESS, NOW HE HAS CAUSED SOMETHING EVEN HE CANT STOP, BECAUSE THE WHOLE WORLD WILL NOT SUPPORT OR BELIEVE HIM AGAIN, HIS GANGSTER TACTICS WILL NOT WORK, THATS WHY HE NEEDS TO BE STOPPED NOW.
Russia has sent 570,000 troops to Ukraine and launched 41 missiles. Putin has authorized the army to fight freely, and the army has begun to slaughter women and children. The United States does not rule out the possibility of sending troops to Ukraine, and Congress is making plans to send troops
Only NATO can stop this war, buy not messing up in Russian's  backyard.
Wow way to kill all Innocents people! Fck you PuTin!
Hell of a time for US to be without a leader
Plese pice is good
This is why trump is his best friend
Zelenski is a giant coward weakest leader next to Biden. With his weak words
Brits Government is the major instigator and the Russia hater in this conflict by supporting the Ukrainian Neo-Nazis against peaceful Ukrainian and the Russian speaking citizens in Ukraine. Anglo- US NATO alliance have crossed the Russian red line by their new world order delusional foreign policy against Russia.
Don't blame all of Russia. This is just Putin being evil... My heart goes out to all of the citizens of Ukraine.
This is the start of a war....There is going to be repercussions.
Has any of the attacks got anything to do with American funded Bio Warfare labs. Reports suggest 7 or 8 of them have been destroyed. Changes the narrative big time if that's the case.
We have got to put an end to war on our planet. War, poverty, and a lack of biodiversity are going to end humanity. We are all earthlings. We are part of the earth and part of each other.
Ukraine was kind of stolen from russia  though wasn’t it  lol
So it has finally happened
How many pro Russians live in Ukraine?
True so evil..we’re just recovering from covid now this🤔🙄
Most other citizens of most countries don’t blame any one other than Putin. This deeply angers me, beyond belief. Sending love to all 🇷🇺 and 🇺🇦 ♥️💔♥️
so is everybody gonna ignore  that putin warned them, and they ignored it. and now u call him evil for him defending the country... i guess  anybody can ignore important warnings  and wont bother to look at  the  different side of the coin. ignorance is truly a bliss.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5YeX8eCLgA
Putin being evil? Lol I mean look at American presidents ever since the bush administration besides trump
I feel bad for the Ukraine but Puttin needs to just sit and do actual exercises.Sorry for the Russian people who dont want it.
From our World History : Never Trust the Nazism , Communism & Racial & Religious Extremism Regimes , regardless of what they've Said or Signed!  Is this the Best Time for NATO to show its Teeth & the USA to show her Talons to Free Separated & Invaded Ukraine back to the People of Ukraine by repelling the invading Russians out of Ukraine's territories & established a Permanent NATO~US~UN Peacekeeping Base in the Ukraine territory! Sanctions only hurt the innocent Russians that have nothing to do with the Russian Military aggressions towards her weaker  neighbours!
Viva a Rússia .
how in the fk after everything the world has been through is this now happening? putin says ukraine is a threat to russia? how? its tiny in comparison. this is a terrible time for our planet.
There is no more civilian If the civilian is train to war as armi
Mr. President from Ukraine you brought that up on yourself and on your people....😞
Where is all this coverage of the Palestinians when they are being k*ll and evicted of their land by Israel?
After Ukraine is UK turn
2:37 nice mustang
Whear is usa ? Usa Force's are sleepnig
Putin should of been stopped a long time ago! He's a modern day Hitler in the making!
FVP!
wtf is self defense? Shame on u Putin.
God Bless Peoples in Ukraine!🙏🙏🙏
There is no different between what's Russia is doing and what United States and European usually do to other countries like Libya you all know the truth
I hate to say it but Ukraine isnt going to last
Putin has no fault in this situation. The West is the real evil here
 @Dravida Monkey  How so?
Wait for China to do the same thing Boycott China and Russia
Brits will shine Russian shoes
Patrice Oneal  
Doesn’t look like Ukrainian is fighting back
Biden that kkokk skukkr
Crappy reporting!!!
You know what they say about short men.
Somali government should do something
Way to go Beijing bunker biden!
Fuck NATO
Why don't you British, go out and demonstrate against your government and nato? You are to blame for this horror! Why do you pushed Ukraine into this by interfering and encouraging nato membership? Nato, USA and UK are the wirst enemies to the rest of the world, how many countries you attacked, people killed, pieces of land took away? Go out, demonstrate against your governments, ask them their role in this horror
The world is going crazy about Ukraine Ok?, What about Afghanistan, Syria, Palestine, kashmir, Burma, Iraq, Iran, yeman, libiya, somalia, and Sudan🤔🤔🤔
They claim Ukraine is apart of Russia but yet they kill their own people.
No third world war , you crazy. , Is sad sad.
Bad move for Bloody Putin
I think we should just treat them like germany in ww1 and 2. Fuck them then make them pay the bill.
The world is going crazy about Ukraine Ok?, What about Afghanistan, Syria, Palestine, kashmir, Burma, Iraq, Iran, yeman, libiya, somalia, and Sudan🤔🤔🤔
My heart is broken. How can you kill civilians
Where is Ukrainian army???? It looks like the reason for invasion is more like getting closer to NATO border. About decision Putin is Right. He preventing expansion of NATO to his borders with is thread to his country. I hope it will stop at Ukraine. But knowing that history is repeating it will go in farther conflict.... We need new mentality governments. The weapons what humanity have should be used in case of thread from space
those are civil wars, noone is invading another country
If we didnt have biden this never wouldve happened, trump > biden, i dont really care for those who disagree, their braindead. Biden literally acknowledged putins potential ambition towards reunion with other former soviet republics as well. We gotta do something about putin. Also china could possibly already be a greater threat. China, might try to reunite with Taiwan, as Russia is with Ukraine at the moment.
why tf do people that murder someone get the death sentence but presidents that have and could potentially kill thousands more, nothing happens to them? Like im not justifiying murderers or anything but im just pointing out how stupid it is that people with so much money can get away with these things just because they have more 
The West did this to themselves
Ucrania must be neutral between West and Russia to avoid a horrible international war, but I’m pretty sure USA isn’t going to accept this. If the West doesn’t want war stop interfering in Ucrania territory. Putin doesn’t want to occupy this country, just to protect Russians and frontier. Don’t be fool. You don’t understand this?
Unfortunately, history always repeats itself...those that thought there would never be another war in Europe, unfortunately are wrong...Putin has gone mad...I'm more and more glad I'm Portuguese. We're in Europe's tail, fortunately no conflicts or terrorism. But this is right around the corner...strength to all Ukrainian brothers and sisters! 💪
Putin should have been taken out a few months ago when he started to ramp up military power on Ukraine’s border
Nothing but propaganda
This is not fair....
When America invaded Iraq and Libya, killing thousands of people and destroying their infrastructure that has left it's citizens helpless and hopelessly so, no one cared and the united nations general assembly and united nations security remained dumb. So why not Russia equally do what they want today, as Americans did. This is double standard. Nonsense NATO.
they don't want you to build up your corrupted mind
Ukraine needs planes
I fear for my family in southeastern Poland. My love goes out to everyone suffering in Ukraine. Stay strong brothers! 💪 🇵🇱 🇺🇦 💪
Now you see how the Israelites feel now you see how the Indians feel okay America took Outland yo okay and killed my people yo now you see how black people feel give a damn about Ukraine
America vs Russia, that's what you call a real war!
Terrible situation, people just want to live their lives as normal.
Жыве Украïна Қазақстан сіздермен!🇰🇿🇺🇦🇰🇿🇺🇦
I call B.S. it sounds more like the UN is doing the Damage and definitely not Russia.  Believe what you will... Know the history of the long strings between Ukraine and Europe....  Ukraine cut off Natural Gas to Europe...
We need to find inner strength. I love and adore my family, but I would go and fight. I live a comfortable life in the UK, but the thought of what is happening angers and breaks my heart. I have seen this coming for an age. A work colleague laughed at me near 10 years ago when I mentioned a war between us and Russia. Here we are. We need to stand up for our way of life. I am not saying I am not scared but I will go fight for women children and men of NATO. My neighbour, my country.
If we go to war we shouldn't stop until Russia, North Korea and China are all democracy. And while at it take back USA and Canada cough. I for one think this is all set up.
Unfortunately you said it. All around the corner.
You live in Poland, why would you be afraid of anything? Dont believe those fantasy stories about Russian Red alert style taking over the world. Only reason this all is happening is because Donetsk and Lugansk declared independence. Also you dont even know what horrible things Ukrainian army did, they shelled those civilian areas. Men, women and children of those cities have been dying for past 8 years. Also i wouldnt be too quick to say that Ukrainians are innocent themselves. Dig deeper and you might be shocked at what you find. I certainly was at how Russian minority was prosecuted, and terrorized.
NATO should NUKE russia before its too late, this is just the start of world domination
 @Scar Sky  that is not what he's talking about about at all. i think you're ignorant to the power some military weapons have and the consequences they can have to surrounding countries and the entire world, let alone the target country
 @Hairy Rokeke  if they nuke Russia they it’ll be the start of WW3
https://youtu.be/L0G9WRRWIuM.
Any war is result of sick mind. Praying for Ukrainians.
Government vs Government & innocent people die. This is so sad 😞
Initiator war russian Putin evil, greedy stop war peace
Putin got trump elected..trump is still defending Russian invasion the fat tellituby treasonous insurection clown owes Russian banks over 400 million in loans
WTF Putin?!?!?
Im sure there’s a large amount of people in Russia don’t support the war but the majority do
Isn't it a good thing the U.S. stole Ukraine's gold reserves when they overthrew the elected government back in 2014??
Putin =  Hitler of  21st century
Send US and NATO Troops to Ukraine!!!
All this is is another psyop where the United States government will send over millions of dollars in humanitarian aid to Ukraine when this is over, and then everyone gets rich off it, a little bit for the players in Ukraine, a little bit for Putin, a little bit for Biden and all of his cronies, that's all it is, another way for the controllers to demolish the United States, they don't have to do it in the conventional way, all they have to do is start printing millions of dollars and say we have to give it to Ukraine to help those poor people over there even though those poor people won't get a dime of it, and then George Soros will have finally finish what he said out to do topple the United States. Wake up people
Russia don't care about civilian casualties. Look at their bombing patterns in Middle East and South Asia. 0 shits about casualties
Will Putin Be The Next Hitler As The World Stands By And ONLY Watches?
After Ukraine UK is next
Hitler reborn
Bbc and all alike loves this shit, making hundreds of millions selling bulshit unverified stories.  Covid disappeared over night.
Covid now this !
Why Putinnn
Stay with Ukraine 🇺🇦 from Greece 🇬🇷
Right?
These self proclaimed dictators destroy so many lives and countries. Putin is the same as Hitler in my opinion. Kim, in North Korea is another crazy!
Peace On Earth🙏#LoveOneAnotherWorldWillBeABetterPlace
civilians life goes hirable, true.
Really, this guy ain’t playin! You should have gotten it before now🤯
Dear Jesus, I for Ukraine. Protect Ukraine from the thoughts of this known devil
My heart goes out to the people of Ukraine 🇺🇦
Dear Americans! Your government sponsored the 2014 Euromaidan uprising with 5 billion usd which overthrew the Russian friendly government. This pretty much what meddling means. Almost entire Eastern Ukraine is ethnic Russian territory, and they were unhappy about the US backed coup and decided to break away from Ukraine. This is the preface for tge current events. Do you see the American goverment's responsibility here?
This is the one person who make a war  VLADIMIR PUTIN.....SAME HITLER.INNOCENCE PEOPLE ARE SUFFERED.
The elites are at it again.
Hope you guys find peace in this if any Ukrainians read this love from the US and I hope your defense gives them hell🇺🇲❤️🇺🇦
I'm actually feeling sorry for the Ukrainian people right now, Russia shouldn't Involve Innocent  civilians.

Death to the west
You think this is bad? Wait till China takes Taiwan and Iran takes Iraq. This is step one of a world war. Welcome to the big show ladies and gentlemen. China is already posturing to invade only a matter of time before Iran mobilizes
Why are you informing that the civilian take refuge in underground railway?. I hope they won't attack them there.
Russian Nazis will lead Russia to the next upcoming collapse as it already took place in 1917 and 1991
Are we gonna stop his military?
Thank god I’m in yeeman
Yeah!
Russia got its butt kicked by afgans. War will not end well for them or anybody.
Orthodox power
Reminds me of Iraq and Afghanistan,  very similar  ?
UJk,France,Germany and all Europe will be a Russian coliny.
Russian leaders are WAR Criminals! Russia is the modern day Nazi!
Easy take over if all people leave ukraine
Obama & Killarys war, they started this mess in 2014.
So, the US does the same thing it's okay but not when Russia does the same thing?
This is a WAR CRIME. Russia should be Expelled from the UN and NATO and Putin should be sent to The Hague
Only a psychopath bombs civilians and tells the rest of the world to not help but not only is putin a psychopath, he's a psychopath with nukes.
How anyone thinks Putin is a stronger better person than Biden. You're showing your true colors. This is a tragedy of epic porportions and it breaks my heart. Putin is evil! No praise of any kind from me.
Immer wieder interessant dass ein ganzen Volk einem einzelnem soviel Macht gibt...habt ihr denn aus der Vergangenheit nichts gelernt? Es macht mich wütend das es so viele korrupte und unfähige Politiker gibt ,die hier falsche Entscheidungen treffen !!
BBC = British Bullshit Cooked.
Kinda shit that makes you reconsider international regulations against assassination.
The movie Tenet was right. Russia is invading Ukraine.
Taliban pls come and help defend against these bullies.
:No to war The people of Ukraine deserve a better life--لا للحرب الشعب أوكرانيا يستحق حياة افضل 不战争🥺нет войне🥺🙏🙏🦚🙏
Where are the U.N TALK BUT NO ACTION.
He wants Ukraine, so he can turn off the fuel taps to the rest of Europe and UK. If he gains control of Ukraine. Europe, will be held to ransom
European countries especially Germany love cheap russian gas and Russia likes this very important income making them Trillions of 💶 Euros.
Biden=Illuminati=Anti-ChristOrthodox power
Yo wtf
I don't want to live on this planet anymore
well,only thing left is to fight
Pure evil.
Sending prayers to all Ukrainians

BBC one sided views, lets start with why Nato/USA needs a  military base on russia border in Ukraine.?
Ukraine, stay strong, the world is praying for you 🙏🏻🇺🇦❤
War ...War Never Changes...
Ukraine has been at war with Russia since Russia stole Crimea
SATAN(ALSO KNOWN AS LUCIFER OR THE DEVIL) IS EXPOSED!!!!! Hell was created for Satan and his fallen Angels(Matthew 25:41 AND 2Peter 2:4).Satan and his fallen Angels fought God’s angels to overthrow God but were defeated and were thus thrown out of heaven to the earth(Isaiah14:12-14 AND Revelation 12:7-10).Satan and his fallen Angels will be thrown into hell to be tormented 24/7 for ever and ever(Revelation 20:10 AND Jude 1:7).Satan and his fallen Angels want you to join them suffer in hell even though you were not part of the coup makers(Revelations 20:10-15).Satan, and for that matter his fallen Angels stand condemned by God and hence do not have any chance of repentance(John 16:11).Fortunately, you and I have up to minutes before our death to repent just like the criminal on the right side of Jesus on the cross (Luke 23:39-43) WHY NOT REPENT NOW AND GIVE YOUR LIFE TO JESUS?Since you don’t know how and when you will die, my brother or sister, THE TIME TO REPENT IS NOW AND GIVE YOUR LIFE TO JESUS!!!
oh shut it, please.  stuff your prayers - UK is guilty here, encouraging Ukrainians to think they can stand up to Russia by selling them pea-shooter's and when the time comes where is the UK? No-where, just a lying cheating country as usual.  UK is disgusting - you should be ashamed.
No one is carrying any firearms?  Honestly your country is being invaded but no weapons? O thats right let's take everyone's weapons away in peace time.
Russia must make order! The US understand that you will never rule Russia. Remember it once and for all. Give us Slavs peace and leave !!!Vivat Vladimír Putin!
It will be a sneak attack on usa.
Украина - это народ России
Putin needs to get sacked and never work again.
💥💥💥Biden is a weak incompetent moronic jackass who was elected through voter fraud and voter stupidity !!!You imbeciles who helped to get him fraudulently elected have all contributed to the present chaotic situation in our country and around the entire globe !!!We can never allow you imbeciles to hold positions of control or power ever again , you know absolutely nothing about what it takes to be in charge and maintain proper law and order , you excel in creating chaos and confusion by electing and placing diverse inexperienced fools into positions of government !!!Destructive socialism is your model and mantra under the guise of diversity and social equity !!!Biden is a crook and a fool and we are paying a high price for allowing him to remain in office !!!Putin is taking Biden for the weak foolish sucker that he is !!!💥💥  Biden the pretender must go !!!!!!!  💥💥💥
Gotta admit at 0:39 that armored vehicle on the left moves like an RC tank
What the fuck man
that's  horrible. Its just like western invasion of middle east
Russia: 
Once more the West has abandoned Ukraine.
BBC OMFG!
Reporter: western media has been warning for weeks. Reality: Western media has been stirring war for months. Supplying weapons to ukraine to pose threat to russia - not reported.
Unbelievable
USA will be next by the russians,   see what Biden did.
Then Peter said to them, “Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. Acts 2:38
My heart goes to all of the Ukraine people :(
Fake news

Ukraine leader is a liar!!! This is not t Democratic World!!!  It is a very evil, murdering system that will kill women, children, babies and anyone else that does not bow to them!!! Move on Putin and show that the Russian Bear will not bow to this system!!!  The Lake OF FIre await the western powers and anyone that supports them!!!!!!!!!!!
Imagine trying to help people being persecuted by a far right neo nazi regime put into power from a coup set up by obombya in 2014
As a half Ukrainian having friends and family in Ukraine I pray for my country and for the people 🙏🇺🇦
Lmao they've had it coming death to nato and the un
Who's ready to get drafted
At 7:20 it looked like Canada.
Screw Anglo-Saxons Catholics are anti-christ
Ukrainians should abandon and take the war to Russia to Russia land take ur army to they land let's see if he will not stop if u coming for my land I won't defend mine especially if I know I will lose and most of ur forces ain't defending they home land I will go straight for urs and take it or die trying so we both will have dead and a wreck country
Imagine the war on IRAQ in 2023 i want to see how the fake media and social media would react .. i lost my cousin there and I'm ashamed that he died for nothing just to protect the Saudis and their oil
To protect the private billions and interests of his and his oliarch friends, Tsar Vlad Putin will send young Russian men to war and have them fight until the last Russian body bag is filled with torn parts of those young Russian soldiers.
Maybe Ukrain should give freshwater back to Krym instead of starting 3rd world war
So much for democracy, little support from europe against autocratic Putin, we are more scared than the Ukranians
Remember what Jesus said before his final return! Be ready .. pray for all people.
Honestly USA needs to show USSR our power and what we have to make them back off from Ukraine this is so sad, for you to feel like your being attacked when UKR has not done even a single thing
NATO is run by Russia and China.
Putin has mental issues
I am so sorry

Praying for you and your friends/family and your country!!
Usa needs to mind their own business they iniciated enough wars
 @Black Phoenix  u right, it’s sad for everyone to witness unfortunately, but it’s politics for ya
 @DBCooper  it's always the work class who suffers
 @Black Phoenix  yeahhhh you right 😞😞
Meanwhile NATO nations have been reducing their military for the past 20+ years. I think it's pretty safe to say that was a fatal mistake. Diplomacy is nice, but in the end it won't help anyone. Let's hope our politicians finally understand that now.Let's face it: If Russia decides to move on to NATO nations after they are done with Ukraine, then we couldn't stop them.
Is Putin Okay at all?My heat goes out to all Ukrainians in this horrible times. It is well 🙏🙏🙏
Europe will fall under Russian rule.Orthodox power
President Putin please stop the war.
THE SOUNDS OF THE SIRENS ARE REALLY SCARY ...ITS SO HORRIBLE TO WATCH THAT WHATEVER UKRAINE BUILT IS BEING DESTROYED BY THIS RUSSIAN DICTATOR PUTIN
We should really listen to the Ukrainian Sherlock Holmes.
Every gas pipe in Europe is owned by Russia. How dim can Europ be.
Self defense ? You attacked innocent civilians ! You started this sh*t ... I don't care about economy and all this political situation ... You are killing innocent people !
To hell all my investments in Russian stock, so much fun with those fireworks. I regret nothingKeep your pity and love for something else, please. No civilian lifes and property damages. This is not a war at all
Wearing bullet proof vest and then two regular dudes are like “bruhh “
that old man is litterally reading... there's so much we don't understand about this. half of ukraine only speaks Russian. fuck BBC
Can't sell arms or fund defense budgets with world peace. These poor folks should have left weeks ago.
Why does the video of Putin talking look like something from the avatarify app?
scumbags ... down with putin
The people of Taiwan should pay close attention to what is happening to the people of Ukraine. Taiwan is next.  If you live in Taiwan and can fight, the time for you is now to join the military and train to fight for democracy. You are next...
I’m hoping many of them seek refuge in Poland. Poland is offering refuge to Ukrainian citizens. My prayers go to Ukraine. 🙏🏼
I hope this doesn't escalate into WWIII. If so, we won't survive. Rest in peace to everyone who dies in the missile attacks and God save the queen and this planet 🇬🇧♥🇺🇦
Joe has alot of blood on his hands. Ruining America day by day.
Daa
Putin💪💪💪
Poland next
YOu know - this modern day Hitler - how the WW2 ended well, we should be repeating this only not in Japan but in Moscow
Russia expanding. Germany accidently forming a none aggression pact, and Ukraine on fire.Hide ya Ferdinands and God save the Queen we don't want anything else going wrong
Bomb England,France and Germany
Everything is fine. I dont know what the fuss is about. This looks peaceful to me.
the world is just gonna sit here and watch him do it too.
So did the RAF in Germany. Targeted night bombing of civilians? GTFO
China is watching this unfold. That's the real threat. Western countries can sit and watch this aggression on TV and do nothing. But if China invades Taiwan, a member of NATO, to reclaim it, we're entering into WW3. Very dangerous times we're living in. Sadly, the world needs another pandemic to slow all of this down.
Snarling Putin? I didn't see any 
I have no words, my heart goes out to the civilians
Russia has a mad man as a leader.  I hope the Russian people take charge. This is the act of a mad man.
W Russia 👑🔥
i hope PUTIN  wil be gone soon
See you soon World War III
Putin chill man
I hope that nobody is hurt praying for you people's
But you comments are praise Putin. Dat is the best president. Watch and see. He we go down soon. When US say something accept it.
Biden = Anti-Christ
America prva
or if Putin invades Latvia...

Zelensky is too naive and are barking at the wrong door. Be like Afghans, they defeated Russia, the US, and NATO.
The goat herders in the Russians army can’t even drive a tank. With a clown shoe as president I can understand their lack of motivation and self respect. Look at America we just got our Namby Pamby president trump out of office and we still haven’t shaken it.
Historical Bruh Moment. My heart goes out to those affected.
I remember the british civilian bombing of Germany. What legitimacy do the British have to comment these matters? Big air murderers criticizing small air murderers? GTFO
You didn't report on Iraq like this

Time to make somebody go night night.
Civil killings?   You have to be kidding.  Today's technology is so precise no Civil casualties should not be significant.Let Russia be Russia When the US attacked the arabs countries,  nobody did shit.Ukrainian Government is so corrupt. Biden did millions dealing with that Government. What you see on the screens,  is and has always been manipulated. Welcome to Hollywood.
F*ck the damn Russia, they should just go blown themselves up instead of attacking others to occupy their land
Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.
The sad part of this war is that innocent people are going to loose their lives 😭😭 but we must pray even harder because God he is in control 🙏

hitting apartment buildings yet telling ukraine to put down guns..fkn coward putin is
So this is legit gen z gonna end up being drafted
Just imagine how much pain and work must have been put to build these. But now just within seconds all destroyed. Innocent civilians suffer. What satisfaction leaders get seen dying people. Pathetic.
This is just…unreal
Noboby cares about Palestine, suddenly people freak out about Ukraine.. What's wrong with you people.. May yall burn in hell
Showing protest ending in being arrested and suggesting it is fascistic; when that is PRECISELY what the UK government is passing a bill to allow them to do here
bullshit... Ukraine systematically massacres ethnic russians and then says democracy... the current Ukrainian government is the result of a coup.. not democracy... 30% of the ethnic russian people are denied access to politics
Not to be rude but that moment when the couple with the kid said 
Media propaganda
If Putin has become unhinged, the whole world is in trouble.
The stingers Lithuania send to Ukraine  1 moth before this. Did good job since it shot down most of fighter jets, just today Russia had control over nothing since they never expected people to fight back, now most of Russian troops joined Ukraine and fighting against Russia with Russian tanks shooting Russians
Biden is Illuminati
If the Ukraine need help we a here we a ready to go and fight against putin
well NATO time for you to step up
What??? putin pontificates about the deNazification of Ukraine after lying and demolishing his own credibility with the Ukraine country? This guy is at least 6 peas short of a tuna casserole! Is it time for the Ukraine to return the favor and strategically take out some russian airports and military installations? I pray NATO bands together and conquers russia. russia is like cancer. The more it grows, the more it destroys. Is it time to remove the tumor while its still small?
Europe is Russian colony God bless Vlad the emperor
Shocking how quickly the supposedly unbiased BBC becomes a propaganda mouthpiece 'snarling Putin'...Don't get me wrong, I would have liked the West to stand by their ally, Ukraine, and had military force in the region. Rather than standing aside and wringing their hands.Putin called our bluff and now knows we are weak, if we had stood by our morals and our promises, he wouldn't have dared to invade if it meant fighting USA or NATO forces.
The Russians should get ready for gorilla warfare, it's not going to be easy
Cause Ukrainians are white.
Exactly they all turn blind eye , you know why cuz everyone is scared of America , America is in power
And in Canada
You feel the pain when war is effecting you directly. Have some researching on open prison of kashmir
We want pakistan sanction for meeting with putin....
The West invaded Iraq and Afghanistan to Free the People from the grast of a Tyrant,... Democracy and Freedom Loving Ukrainians is now under Attack and Invaded by a TYRANT!!!!!!!
That’s what you get when you take US as ally your country will be destroyed and US will abandon you
Shouldn't have attacked the Donbas first.
I'm wondering, is this what happen when US invaded Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan?
Not one decent American should make any sacrifice either economic or in blood until Nancy Pelosi and all her leftist friends go to the gallows. No one should even 
May God take control. Please come soon so the beginning of woes begin. Raptures your people.
Russia is going to Hell

This won't stop until UK and British citizens put a stop to Russian money laundering in London and Isle of Man. The people who gave the orders to invade live by your side, their children go to your schools, their wives shop in your boutiques, with money stolen from our people. You can stop this all in an instant.
A master strategist could renavigate the attack. The russian military knows what they're doing is wrong. They arent shelling civilians to the point of barbarism and it seems their military is scared. Which makes sense considering no one has attacked a country in cold blood for decades. Fight them away. Putins desperate clearly
Putin is Smart he said he wont attack so they wouldnt know when hes gonna do it
Putin....ich treffe dich in der Hölle !! Gruß Adolf
Hmmm like hitler...😬
BBC: the Ukrainian president is gonna lose his job.
It's so sad how man because of hunger for power doesn't care about the feelings of others 🙃 😕 😪.  How many years do u think u gonna live on this planet that u are ready to kill innocent people for power?. Lord have mercy 🥺.
It's all about interests
Then why the nato want to surround Russia ? The west keep picturing the Russians as the bad guys however they did not start spreading military bases around Europe or US in the past 60 years and when they start to show that they are serious about their security the west start crying and say see those bad Russians want to protect them selves while we are trying to surround them peacefully 😏 that’s a hypocrisy
🇰🇿Qazaqstannan sälem, kardeşimKazaklar da Ukrayna'yı destekliyoruz. Kazakistan hükümetimizin Rusya korkusu nedeniyle Ukrayna'ya yardım etmeye cesaret edememesi utanç verici.
Ohh no sad face have mercy on dumbases like you , it's all about power
You guys should always understand how propaganda works in almost any situations1) Sad music in the background ☝️2) Crying child so it adds more drama to the situation ☝️3) Scary intonation for more effect ☝️Basically, propaganda always works and hits through the emotions, not real factsSo, please, show more crying children during 8 years of the war on the Donbass as well, show people being burned alive in Odessa in 2014, show many Russians people in Ukraine being killed during last years in the 
That Russian lady who says it horrible warring with Ukraine and Ukraine should lay down their arms... that's a very close minded way of thinking. If it's so horrible then both sides should not surrender but instead lay down the arms on both sides. This world has seen enough war and violence. We know we need to do better things to fix the catastrophic nature of human kind but how will we ever do it if the world's leaders can't set an example. Fuck you yet again mankind you should be ashamed of yourself 🤬
I wonder when Russians are going to stand up all over Russia against this evil and coward man.
Saudi arabia with russia fack الامم المتحدة🇷🇺🇸🇦🇸🇦💪☝️☝️
This would have never happened under Trump. Sippy cup Joe is just watching from his wheel chair.
This is what you get when a old KGB agent with the sickness BAD NOSTALGIA is in power. Putin : 
Fuck russia im so dissapointed on this fkn heartless ppl.
The killing of innocent people is disgusting. Lots of the people in the middle of this power grab, have families in Russia. Shameful is to light of a word for this !!!
America nato idiot gave Russia no choice this I a war america nato wanted now they wished they didn’t poke the bear
part of me is thinking, Nazis fighting fascists... why shouod i care? But then i thiink of the kids whos done no wrong... i pray for peace for them..

If you enjoy country living and in the kitchen videos come check us out. Blessings from Texas 😊❤️🇺🇸
They didn't believe the West .
Italy stay with Russia..  !!!!!! Ukraina Is not in Nato
where the hell is the ukraine army i havent seen them at all russia is wiping out key infrastructure and is weakening ukraine
You know it's not Russia who iniciated the idea of Ukraine joining in NATO?
They've been warned and still proceeded
Exactly
Zelensky should flee while he can, or he will end up like navalny.
This is terrible
BBC has the  best live coverage of this in the world. Thank you everyone involved. You are the eyes of the world.
lol at this point why complain with your propaganda bbc 
Biden and family and other other top us officials have family in top jobs in Ukraine's oil industry, coincidence?I think not NATO is disgusting,go Russia!
With the encouragement of nato Usa and United-kingdom zelinki wanted to make a frog who wanted to be a beef
Please stop war
Putin, that lying, murdering piece of ---- was ALWAYS going to invade Ukrain, no matter what anyone else said, and contrary to what he told the World.  He has always been an untrustworthy maggot, now he shows his TRUE colours.  Russia will never be the old USSR again, but Putin is trying.  We should NEVER have helped Russia in WW2, we should have just let it crash and burn.
A line has already been drawn between Devil forces and Righteous one! It’s up to mankind which to choose!
Not as worst as Israel killed Palestine.
If America doesn't want nuclear weapons in Cuba then how can Russia allow American to put nuclear weapons in Ukraine.  it's simple .......
What the fuck Russia?! This is horrible
Putin warned NATO against creeping encroachment into former WARSAW PACT nations.NATO and the USA did not listen and persisted in encroaching.This war is the result of that NATO foolishness !NATO/USA is at fault ! Russia is defending itself against future annihilation.
OK I'm sorry but we as a planet have to face this with ruthless intervention together. We are better than this! This must end now!
If you have got eyes of your heart and have some sort of analytical ability, please do research the world around specially the world before 1900 and after. I can bet you’ll find a hell lot of difference in terms of education system, economic system, societal norms, food industry, medicine industry, hospitals and much much more. Please understand my above statement in the context of the term “System”. What that means is, since thousands of years of the known man history, the “Systems” remained same irrespective of any culture, religion, society, race etc.Since last nearly 150 years, the system gets a dramatic shift in terms of almost everything around. Why it all happened? Because illuminaties had decided to implement the “World Order”. To control human beings, the control of money as well as “Rulers” of nations was important. They invented the so-called 9-to-5 job system to support the world order. They invented modern education system to convert the youngsters into mere “Office clerks” who’s aim of life is just to get a job and that’s it. For people of the 21st century they devised a beautiful yet most fraudulent term “Global village”. They have contaminated our foods and pharmaceutical industry and have destroyed our spiritual system which was supposed to come from religion. They have ruined three institutions of the society, namely the clergy, the mother and the education. They have very beautifully destroyed us all and are still doing it. And we, as “Gentiles” see it all and believe that everything is runningBiden is Satan and NATO is Illuminati's tool.
but why was it ok for US almost launch nukes at Russia when they sent their ships to Cuba ? it's very similar situation. just saying. And to  ask why Russians and Ukranian people don't want war is STUPID, those two nations are brothers there is nothing but love for each other, this conflict is like bad dream.
Why did Ukraine even try to act like they would fight.America stay in your lane.
White people always prop war in Africa, now you see it. Enjoy!
Impose sanctions on Russia.
7:49 deliberately find younger millennial generation that don't even get how history works and that america hates them, have movies/cartoons/tv shows mock them, the younger russians are the ones who sell out their own country but of course your biased and interview anyone that agree with you same as hk riots. Talk to young terrorist protesting stabbing cops not the ACTUAL cops
This is heartbreaking.... Putin will be another historic tyrant.. He is no patriot!
So true what this one woman has said. 
Just to ask, if his declaration of war  was 28 min. long, why do we see only a minute? Can we see the whole thing?
Do Ukraine have a defence force?   What defence are they putting up ?
Strange how we cared a lot less when we did the bombing in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan.
The Russians cannot use fake news as an excuse anymore after this.
Congratulations BBC, you have got some news now. You were bored.
where are the americans now?
This is the fruit of biden’s incompetence.
🙏🙏🙏 Ukrainian
Sad for Ukraine and Ukrainians. They were played by US and the Europeans. US and the European are responsible for everything.
This is terrible
Cant understand how we can let 200 men controll whats happening to over 100 millions peoples economi our bread. If its by my old viking law here in Skåne the countrys you say is the best in the world.. I would not lie that happned here you have me with a butterknife riping u apart screaming odins name. It takes armys to take down a country, very little to take down the responsible for it .. if people were smart they will take them down and start something new there not gods the have power but needs air like any being
Animals
Here's my question:How long can the Russian Government last on inflation and a poorer economy as a result of this war?How long, exactly, can their military operations last in Ukraine when it's costing them Billions?
RUSSIAN KEEP GOING!!✌✌✌AGANST FOR RACISTS!!!
this is  actually Biden war  and the democrats war  talking shit about Russia  i feel for the People of Ukraine  but i hope Putin gets his evidence against  Biden and his son he said he was looking for also Biden is a foooken  idiot and doesn't belong in the white house
He said de-nazification!?!?He is pulling out all the stops here! Give us a break!
The Russians are doing a full on Desert Storm overwhelm from multiple directions war. The Ukrainian doctrine has been to put up a delaying fight to allow the majority of forces to fade into the ether to fight another day. Ukraine forces will be wiped out in a straight up fight. Ukrainians have always hated Russians. The surviving military forces will fight a guerilla war and train civilians who want nothing more than to kill Russians.  The Ukrainian guerillas have to out last The Russians and cause them to bleed, bit by bit. It was done in Iraq and twice in Afghanistan.
TRUE!!!
They were considered evil for less psychological burden😅
They have infinite  oil and bulllets. What about that
Putin is just evil.
Denazification are you fr LOL
This must not be happening
ucranian - NAZIS, FASCISTS,  ANTISEMITS!!
Supposedly united states is siding with Russia so most likely Americans like me will go to war too.
That Russia guy is greedy af and crazy as well what the heck is an old man like him look for in this world!
Where are the feminists? Only guys want to fight and defend their country
How is Putin 'snarling' in his video? Demonization much? Not defending him but really the press should be impartial.
Please stop. This is disgusting. My heart is breaking.
PUTIN #1 ✌✌✌✌
Instead of sending thoughts and prayers why don’t we send more anti tank and anti air missiles, they need them more than prayers
Putin is a lying scumbag and a brutal dictator with an enormous nuclear arsenal. In 1962 we could have completely deystroyed the Soviet Union while sustaining destruction of about 1/3 of America. Today it is mutually assured destruction of 100% of both countries if there was a nuclear exchange. Turns out 
This is horrible but the rest in peace those who pass under the bombing but how much propaganda can they propagate
🇷🇺🦁
Putin needs to be eliminated fast. War is horrible not good
Long Live Ukraine!!! Nato get your foot out of your a$$ and help!!!! Long live Democracy!!!!
bidens a idiot
My thoughts and prayers go out to ukraine. Praying for safety in ukraine.
Exactly!!
Putin he’s a killer
Go Putin Go!!! Russian power! The west should've listened.
Europe and US are doing too little, too slowly.  NATO is useless.  Putin has already invaded and the West is still using useless sanctions.
I can take pets. Dogs and cats. Fish and Birds.Allergic to rabbits .
If the international community cannot stop Putin then the UN is as good as dead
THE LEADERS OF THE WORLD DON'T GET TIRED OF REPEATING HISTORY, THEY ARE ALL OF A LOW CONSCIOUSNESS. WE HAVE TO START ELECTING PRESIDENTS WITH SOUL AND HIGH CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE POPULATION DEVELOP INTUITION AND THE CONNECTION WITH GOD SO THAT THEY STOP DECEIVING US, A WELL DEVELOPED INTUITION WILL ALLOW US TO SEE THE TRUTH IN EACH PERSON.
We are slaves to history, death is imminent to many, we are now forced to fight in this war, with our hearts and our lives.
Those 2 Russian Jets Flew in Totally  Unopposed 😳
USA behind All these happening 👈👈👈🤔🤔🤔
Puttin is a liar, if he said something , he will do something else.
Pretty sure this is not what the Beatles wanted when they wrote 
The Russian civilians don't want this war!!! PUTIN - may you be forgiven for your ill will! Their blood is on your hands!
Mr.Vladimir Putin !! What aru you doing!! Russian are many good people But you are staying at home big belly just ordering  with a miximum protection... Love Russian ❤️
Do you think your government cares about the people...
Why using such excuses “we no feel safe, we protecting our selfs”Looks like foreign investments to Russia just feed an monster…Then…CHINA!!!!Next target Taiwan.
Zašto? Koji kurac vam to treba? Čemu rat?
Where the hell are the Kyivan citizens going? Should not they have fled earlier, thereby avoiding traffic gridlock? I mean the deepstate have been escalatingly beating the war drums for a minute now.
Lmao, your nation did this to themselves, goodluck
Only God can stop Putin- read your Bible- the Book of Ezekiel! He will turn him about.
Wtf amigo vos estas re loco
Verdad
My hat’s off to the brave Russians who publicly speak out against the war.   We take for granted freedom of speech but over there putin likes to disappear people for expressing those type of opinions.
Humans are hypocrites! Crying over Ukraine but silent over Palestine, Yemen.  Russia had no choice, they’re defending themselves. All Europe and the US wants is for Russia to kneel to them lol  or going to happen
Weak men, make hard times, thanks Biden you weak POS
For sake of civilian, why don't Ukraine president agree with treaties and truce of Russia
THIS IS NOT THE UNITED STATES PROBLEM LET THEM IUT THERE HELP THEM PEOPLE IF THEY WANT HELP WE ALL READY. DO ENOUGH FOR EVERYONE TIME FOR.  COUNTRYS TO GET OFF THERE LAZY ASS,S AND HANDEL A PROBLEM IF NEED BEE.  RUSSIA  CAN DO AS THEY SEE FIT AND IN WAR INOCENT PEOPLE GET KILLED  THATS JUST PART OF LIFE. SO GET OVER IT
Chillingly one sided.
We living in a world of. Dictators
Idiots!
thats not the russians...ya bunch o liars...Thats the Yanks...trying to cover for Hunter...stay out o russia...tits
Puttin is an ugly man, bullying Ukrainian people and country no were to go. Gods got his plan which is bigger then ugly puddin and his lies.
God bless all of Ukraine and all of its peoples.
NATO Put on a gun but in your head, this was what they wanted to put in Ukraine hypocrites
Take the u.n. nukes biden. And the money laundering the fuck out of putins back yard.
I watched a video last week in which Klaus Schwab says Putin is part of his group including Canada's leader, France's leaders and so on. The World Economic Forum approves of this attack.....guaranteed!!!
It's amazing mass media reports on war
As an American citizen I SUPPORT RUSSIA 100%. 
I see hypocrites here. Why didnt your heart bled when America/NATO was bombing the Middle-East and Afrikan countries? Filthy idiots!
BBC News, is extremely manipulativ...
All of the leaders of the developed world think they are acting in the best interests of the people. This could not be further from the truth. They act on behalf of the super rich. They do not do what is best for the citizens. Corruption is the common theme among all developed nations. Therefore, it is time for the citizens to take away the power they allowed them to have. I see it this way. There are 8 billion citizens around the world. There are around 10,000 super rich and around 25,000 political leaders. I really like those odds. Any general would love those kind of odds. We just need to make the decision of when to put this nonsense to an end. You say how? Easy. We, as citizens publish a list of grievances. We collectively submit them to all of the political leaders. We give them an ultimatum; step down peacefully or be removed by force. Do you think they would resist an 8 billion man fighting force? Just that simple. Do what we say and live or refuse and suffer the final consequences. 30,000 against 8 billion. My money is on the much larger group.
When civilians are driving away from your country and and not to it, it shows what side you're really on. Putin trying to pretend he's a liberator lmao.
Why?
Who cares, not my problem, and if I was in that situation I would fight back not run like a coward defend what you love even if it brings death!
 @james Bartley  what if you have children to protect? Or if you aren't properly trained to do something about it? You sound like you are romanticizing the unthinkable.
 @Mia Mia  Childern are even more of a reason to fight back I couldn’t imagine having a child and running from MY COUNTRY I would rather DEFEND my believes and home, what good is Ukrainian land to Russia with no people to lead! If you have citizens that are raising against you would that land be desirable still. DONT THINK SO and then maybe you will get other countries support, no one will fight with you if you don’t fight for yourself first
It doesn't feel real at all
very upsetting to see civilians suffering in between all of this. families in safe zone have to get to some home with kids.
NEVER TRUST A COMMUNIST !!
We're under attack at our own borders.
Yet again more unecessary evil ....I really do feel like its the end times and thats rly sad cuz I havent ever lived
Why can they just make peace
MY FAMILY IS SWEET NO DAY I DONT GO WITHOUT THEM
#KILLPUTIN
Come,
USA, Nato and the west should shut up!No one said anything when the terrorists of the USA attacked, destroyed, stole Iraq, and killed a whole nation there! The double moral is sick! And the whole Nato, UK, USA and others with them are terrorists and are the cause of the whole was now in the area by placing military around Russia and provoke wars as ususal!
What about the 10s of thousand children killed in afghansitan by cowardly american army ! I hope the military might america try to engage with russian army. Then will see how toufg americans  are . P ussys!
This is the fail of the world.
Few months ago same thing happened between Israel and Palestine but America was silent UN was silent and many other western countries were silent and called Muslims the Muslims protecting their nation were being called terrorist . Such hypocrisy
Shouldn't have listen to America.Putin warned y'all
Russian Empire 👍
The Russian ruble is even more worthless than ever. Serves Putin right the best way to hurt a rich person is to turn them into poor people. BTW How the fuck did they get so rich after 1991. When Communism fell they were as poor as homeless people WTF happened????
Putin is a pathetic coward. We have to do more than just implementing sanctions.. Putin does not, has not and more than likely will not care. He is doing what he wants to, something that has clearly been planned for some time. Whose to say his buddy Cheeto Chief didn't know about it either. My heart hurts for all of Ukraine. 🇺🇦💙💙💛💛
I'm eo Scared I LIVE IN UKRAINE  AHHHHHH
So this is what Russian peacekeeping looks like, bombs falling from the sky and killing people everywhere.......
This could be the start of WW3
They haven't been communist in like 30 years
They were being entertained as welcome guests in the White House, as admirable friends of the President of the United States.
Watch China begin to go down the same path with Taiwan. Make an example out of Putin.. Sanctions are just not going to cut it.....
You have the wrong translation of Ukrainian president
Fuk biden!
This is disgraceful how the hell is this happening in this day and age
United Nations is just a joke
Time to put NATO forces into western Ukraine to protect Poland, Romania and Slovakia, all NATO members and all on Ukraine's western border.
What exactly does Putin hope to achieve by these attacks? Annex Ukraine? A sovereign nation. I think he's a misguided bully😎
🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
Putin is a butcher!!!
Why are we protecting these nazi scum. Learn you history . Why would we want these people in Europe anyway . Thank you putin only leader  that is actusly a leader god bless you putin . And I live in UK shows u the state of the times
How can anyone doubt what Putin was doing.  he has won the war on terror.  He installed Trump in the WH in 2016 he screwed America up and now he is going to run HAVOC.
Pray for Ukraine
No body care when Israel attacking and killing innocents  people in Palastine and people who dead  on Syria .afghanistan . Iraq world build on hyporcrit and still relogion control direction of people to choose whom stand with
Ukraines government asked for this. They kept poking Russia and flipping them off while cozying up to the backstabbing west who have now abandoned them
Trump would never have let this happen ‼️‼️‼️‼️
Use Asymmetrical Tactics as in Vietnam 🇻🇳and Especially in Afghanistan 🇦🇫
LOS DIRIJENTES DEL MUNDO NO SE CANSAN DE REPERTIR LA HISTORIA, SON TODOS DE UNA BAJA CONSCIENCIA. HAY QUE EMPEZAR A ELEGIR PRESIDENTES CON ALMA  Y CON ALTA CONSCIENCIA Y LA POBLACIÓN DESARROLLAR LA INTUICION Y LA CONEXION CON DIOS PARA QUE DEJEN DE ENGAÑARNOS, UNA INTUICION BIEN DESARROLLADA NOS PERMITIRA VER LA VERDAD EN CADA PERSONA.
USA demilitarized Iraq Russia demilitarised Ukraine 😆
This is so sad. work problems out like most people. Prayers sent out stay safe. ❤️🙏🏻
War in da EastWar in da WestWar up NorthWar down SouthEvery where is WAR.........
Don't worry. He will pay a high price. In this life and especially the next. Spilling the blood of Russias innocent slavic brothers, wtf?
 @dppedersen  Europe, the US and all their allies need to stand up and retaliate. If he is allowed to take Ukraine with no consequence he will think he can do whatever he wants.
 @Luke King  And there will be consequences. Financially sanctions and lots of support to the ukrainian guerrilla with money and weapons forever. This will be a new Afghanistan for Russia.
 @dppedersen  sanctions do nothing to deter him, it’s like a slap on the wrist.
Maybe Putin isn't the one achieving.
When a bully keeps beating you up, do you think talking to him will work?
Criminal Comunista Putin ! This the way Comunista country act against a democracia !
Who feels really bad for all the niiji’s in Americas we’re still suffering from the hands of these oppressors and the destruction they cause to others worldwide. The world needs to help us in our cause as well.. it’s time for the tenants to pay rent to us indigenous people of Amaru khan aka Americas aka Tuttle Island 🪶🪶🪶🪶up
This how the middle east feels everytime the US and Uk 
This is depressing to look at, I hope Ukraine wins
Denazification???? The heck are you on pal.
Putin wants the world to believe that the Ukrainians started this attack.  He needs to be stopped before more innocents are  murdered 😫 😩
what a liar what an evil man… Sure he's frightened of Ukraine what a lie… Ukraine doesn't have a chance against Russia he's just a killer fighting an imaginary threat because of the hatred he has for the West.  This is all happened before and it will all happen again…
This is all NATO's fault, they could have given Russia the security guarantees and we wouldn't be having this conversation.
6:44 yup.
western countries has caused this ....flaming the war ....and they got it now.....
Jesus Christ the son of God please help for Ukraine 🇺🇦 Give Peace for everyone ⛪️🙏🌿
What really causing this war? I don't understand..
why isn't the west helping?
Ukraine 🇺🇦 to Russia  invade us if your gay
Russia is done for Putin has just buried himself and there's no way back
My heart goes to Ukrainians...  Praying for you. Sending love from Malawi 🇲🇼
Is Putin another Hitler
The western powers will not use military intervention as Ukraine isn't a member of Nato. No European nation not even American will put boots on the ground to fight against Russian forces. It would result in a worldwide conflict if Russians started engaging military forces from the west. It's tragic that innocent people have to suffer.
Nonsense you Russian bot.
Demilitarizing eastern Europe was on the table but Putin mostly wanted assurances that Ukraine be forbidden to join NATO. Why should Russia get to control the security measures of a sovereign country like Ukraine? It has absolutely no right to and NATO could not agree to that demand. Face it, Russia was doing diplomacy in bad faith since it knew that it demands could not be met and would use that as an excuse to start this conflict
 @123GOHANZ  Tell that to NATO that promised not to advance their alliance one inch eastwards towards Russia but are today camped outside their border. Putin is justified not to trust those NATO dogs.
Do you want other countries to get involved so that war can start?
https://youtu.be/L0G9WRRWIuM<
Weapons sale $ increase…energy Demand and prices $ increased….Global investments and hot money $  flow from EU to some “street” you know…. EU stop pipeline flows from R and need to more dependent on US imports…. R get bad sanctions and hurt its economic more….. the leaders of R get worse international reputation and bad public image…..war and people death is only on Ukrainian land…behind the scene bosses with political power and media power just need to manipulate the international media to broadcast in color lenses and people will pay less attentions to internal affairs and conflicts… maybe it is good for future  elections as people a easily get fooled and manipulated by media and politicians. it is a good business for any country that is struggling with its internal affairs (economy, social inequality and conflicts of believe
I wonder why Facebook doesn't ban the BBC for making fake news and not fact news. This is US planned war on China and Russia for  its continued world domination - how can US block someone from Swift, like it owns it ?  Russia was all along for talks , Minsk accord is about talks, they wanted talks about mutual security arrangement and more facts over time. But after Prez Brandon stated that the sansctions are aimed in pushing Russia economy downward , it is obvious that they target funding the military , and think that something good will come out of all this is, well, alzheimerically deranged
God how much I hate Putin...
I dont understand russia people why they like putin its to bad for russia do some favor for yourself change putin some new one
Starve russia, I don't care if I have to pay more for gas or anything else. Destroy their economy until the people rise up and destroy putin.
Imagine going for the jog and a bomb is dropped on your head
oohhh my goooood...wooow.......you western shts you destroyed half of a world don't even pretend that you care your time is coming to an end
Putin's war is against Zelinsky only.
Why isn't the world fighting back?
Putin, Trump, Kim Jung Un. They all like to fuck each other in bed. Enslave and persecute others. They want WW3 why because they are the Hitler, Musolini, Tojo of the 21st Century. Kill all 3 the rest of the world will be free🇺🇸
It’s been 100 years since the Soviet Union was established, thirty years since its fall, and now it seems its beginning again
Putin is the new Hitler; that’s all there is to it. The man is delusional and looks like a heavily sedated vegetable.My greatest concern is that since the drugged up onion head launched his military into Ukraine, will two certain East Asian leaders get ballsy and launch invasions of their own?
Ayo
OMG the kids that were that airport.  Horrible to see just horrible.  So sorry Ukraine.  Hitting civilians is so dirty
ALL DEMOKRATIC COUNTRIES SUPPORT NATO US AND UKRAINE!
Our prayers go out to all of you from the UK
This is horrible.... Why cannot stay in peace.... It's so sad ...
Putin told the west to keep missiles out the Ukraine the West was determined to put them on Russia's door step  no different  than The Russians putting missiles in CUBA  with President Kennedy  we did not want them on our door step.  Russia removed them.The WEST kept sending them into Ukraine was not going to remove them.
fake news!!!!!!
I think that it is just another case of a old man holding on to a bad idea. An idea that has failed and will fail again.
Back to the Russian Empire
Nah, this seems like it's going to be worse.
That is what Putin is trying to do resurrect the old soviet empire. He will fail.
That is the 100% NATO mainstream news/info. Except that, in today’s world, NATO is the danger. NATO manipulates the information. NATO looks for war. NATO created Ukraine by taking advantage of the poor politicians Ukraine chose democratically. NATO is the danger, Stoltenberg the publical puppet (always an European) and the real head is General Wolters, A US general (this is the REAL head and it has ALWAYS been a US General. ALWAYS.) …. and these guys are selling the F35 and all weaponry to the allies. NATO is business and is dangerous. Like most US lobbies. But this lobby is more dangerous than the others. Look where it is leading us … on the edge of war
Pls restore peace among the two countries . We pray for them 🙏🙏🙏
My heart has dropped to stone when I heard this
I hate russia
Sorry Ukraine but a lot of the United States people don't want to get involved in this war. This is an European issue we want to stay out of it. We were there three times in the last century.
The war of  existence
They have no heart for the children, mother and family, does Putten have family, men like these must not go in power they are dog's without heart, our prayers are with you Ukraine 🇺🇦
UK invade Falkland and the whole world..Ok.US invade Iraq,Afghanistan,Libya ok.Russia invade ukraine…not ok ,WW3.Western countries are bunch of hypocrites.
Who does Vitamin Pudding think he is?? We need peace not war!
I pray for peace for the sake of the people's in the world 💞🙏🙏😒👍
Did anyone one of you crying for Ukraine, cried for Serbia when attacked by Nato in 1999 Was there any difference?Western country still support independence of Kosovo but not Crimea or other part of Ukraine, was there any difference? I don’t support any wars but just cant stand    Western hypocrisy.Bye
Sigh.... here we go...
Unbelievably, this is the authoritarian government what the USs Republican party aspires to. They have absolutely no idea
This is Israel Vs Palestine... But European version.
Idk why Ukraine is still trying, their not winning just surrender
Is it just me or i can't see any panic there?? Looks like a normal city.
PUTIN DID THE GREAT JOB
put in needs to be taken out
omg this is horrible what russia is doing to ukraine, love from israel where we do the same to palestine <3
Ukraine doesn't allow men aged 18-60 to leave the country... Shit already got real, people
So, anybody think the U.N. still has any function at all, beyond corruption and waste?
My heart goes to Ukrainian people
Fake News is everywhere. There was no civilian casualties
I still don't see why the West refused to put troops on Ukrainian soil in the first place.  The only thing that Putin understands is force. Putin always said that the breakup of the USSR was a tragedy and that the Ukraine belongs with Russia.  I can just imagine the propaganda being pumped out to the Russian people through state controlled television.
Putin gotta be blasting chief keef rn
As citizens of the world, we have experienced so much in just a few years, I hope that after this dark period, there will be a time when very good things happen... Ukraine our hearts are with you! 🇹🇷🥺♥️
The translation is wrong! Putin is saying that the war has been going on for 8 years. Western propaganda, please provide accurate translation.
So, Russia is satanic, while the USA & NATO are angelic forces, yes? Oh ok, I get it.... Thanks for educating us BBC!
Never trust a comunist ex-KGB puppet president...oh but they are fighting NAZIS...welcome to woke war 1
that girl is right, where is NATO?
Condolence to our Ukrainian brothers & sisters from Bangladesh. .. Civilians are paying the price for the incompetent leadership of Ukraine . .. seems like Ukrainian leaders chose to be on the wrong side of the game. .. if a cat think it's become tiger just because a wolf is provoking it is to be that the cat would definitely be mauled by the real annoyed tiger sooner or later. .. stay strong my Ukrainians brothers & sisters your corrupt government is totally responsible for this mess & misery.
Fake News
BBC, maybe ask USA why they build nukes and missile shields on Russian borders? but mockingbird medias dont ask those questions!
Y’all hella fucked bruh damn lol what a life your cards dealt y’all.
Go go fight stupid
fuck you bbc satanists,, who is qilty when fasists burn alive rusian civilians in Odesa,,you pigs support fasists urop pigs..Long live Putin and burn all fasists kilers terorists..no mesrcy to ucrop fasists pigs. Serbia - Russia.
Didn’t west to the same to Afghanistan and Iraq??Why are they showing this is something never done before !!!!
Get a load of this 
SERBIA AND RUSSIAN HAD/HAVE WAR CRIMINAL LEADERS
PUTIN IS A WAR CRIMINAL
It’s not a war it’s not even that bad ! Putin is the good guy!
I like Ukrainian I like Russia I'm praying for peace and no war
Fuck war. This is terrible
All because the US and Nato start it.
Its time to take the lunatic dicators straight to hell
Lithuania also support Ukraine. It's very hard period for Ukraine people..
No more sanctions, just make the russian economy crumble.
Afgan all over again
The world should think that when covid first surfaced on China soil. people were not so concerned as it seem an isolated situation soon enough it hit the entire world infected with covid. We need to stay put and we need to be weary of the situation on how this can affect the rest of the world 🌎🙏
It’s not even that bad, Leave putin to it, if the BBC say he’s a bad man he’s probably the good guy.
See... this is where other countries need to take a leaf out of us Irish people's book. We just sit in the pub, make music, love, and sing and dance. If he bombs the Guinness factory I'll be over their, and ill have his head under my arm, rubbing my knuckles across it faster than you can say St Patrick.
THE MERCENARY Brutal Martial Arts action now on streaming and Amazon Prime ....................
PUTIN LET THEM LEARN THE LESSON
wow this shit crazy i feel  bad and they are in my prayers
Fight to keep your country
Hit American and NATO and western invansion
You will know the trurh  in the future.Might suprise you!PUTIN IS A WAR CRIMINAL
Go Russia go. Putin is doing the right thing!
Bullshit they targeted a USA bio lab! Not a airport! FAKE NEWS
uKriNe aRe NaZiS. their president is a jew
What have they done....
sto serete pa to je premijaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
THEY WERE TALKING SHIT AT FIRST BUT NOW THEY ARE CRYING THE BLUES !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  GET SOME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
no flights in and no flights out but the press is just chilling ,yeah nice ,another bit of propaganda probably something much worse happening behind the lies
putin was likable until today
This could be the beginning of WW3.
The rich already left
Peace pls
Unless you show transgender African LatinX folks crying, you won't hear a peep from the USA. My suggestion, do what we do during US  election cycles and hire actors. We usually find Hollywood class nazi uniforms and Duck Dynasty extras when we need to help 'modify' a Republican gathering.Works every time.
Russia needs to be destroyed. They are a threat to all humanity. They got overlooked in WW2 because Germany betrayed them, but in the beginning they were every bit as bad as Nazi Germany.
Still can’t believe it’s happening in 21 century. I’m Russian, but all my heart now with people from Ukraine🇺🇦🙏🏻Because it’s our brothers and stupid politicians have to fight between each other and don’t involve civilians and their families..

jesus this is turning into a metro game!!
PUTIN is THE MAN OF HONOR
Later in the future Russia will take Belarus too wait for it.
As an Estonian, I'm watching this and thinking... is Nato gonna help.. is this us next.. I'm sad and I have no words how bad I feel about Ukrainians and how awful it must be for them.. but how long until our fate is the same? Because if Putin is not stopped, then I was only a baby when Russian forces left Estonia and don't remember that, how long until we see them entering our country again... Will this really be World War III or will Western countries really help...? I'm just feeling really insecure right now.. about our fate.. about Baltics, the rest of the region...
We will never forget this.
This day and age it is unfathomable that conflicts are addressed with lethal force. Sending love and peace to Ukraine from 🇨🇦
﴾֍﴿‬
Very sad,you can see the fear and desperation on their faces,God please protect your children
Ukraine must die >:D hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
It's all America and NATO and UK FAULT
God have mercy prayers goes to Ukraine
NATO IS BUSY WITH KILLING PEOPLE IN IRAK DEAR UKRAINIANS!
when saddam invaded Kwait.. the whole world went to war against Iraq.
So striking russian civilians is ok, let's just call them fascists and its ok apparently.
My heart goes out to innocent citizens who are suffering because of these stupid selfish politicians
Russia Did THE GREAT JOB.
Hit by rockets????? This is bullshit people. Don't fall for this scam..  Yeah those actors on the streets waiting around to be bombed sure look panicked.. And all the families taking refuge underground look strangely like regular commuters just going about their day to me.. They tell you right here in the report. Both Ukranian & Russian people don't want war.. So what's this all about then?
🙏🏿Prayers go out for both sides🙏🏿
So sorry this is happening to you stay safe and get out there fast while you still can….bring back the peace
Everything bad is happening like right now first Afghanistan gets attacked from the talibans then Ukraine gets attacked bu Russia what else can get worse but i hope ukraine wins
And so it begins...
Yet another war orchestrated by the USa
Why!! I don't understand.
Like always it's the innocent civilians that suffer for the ambition of the leaders
🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
Neeed strong army to defeat russia
Putin really is ready for the insane asylum. How many will die before he is put there.? Ordinary russians must be horrified at what he is doing in their name.
This is shocking .. why are the rest of the countries and the rest of the world letting this happen. Every country should bomb Russia and then we will see how brave is Putin
Battlefield References
What the hell is he talking about self defense .. What is he self defensing From .. When he's the one whose throwing the first punch ...!!
Weird that he waited for Biden to be in office. Putin has our President in his pocket
Everything is pointing at Putin as being the bad guy, but in reality, the West has paved it.
Sports the Arts at times try to stay neutral but this is not one of those times.During the 1980 Olympics many countries a boycotted they  did not send athletes because of the invasion of Afghanistan by Russia. A boycott needs happen again  and continue until Russia stops it's invasion and present  Russia Regiem is iether defeated by election
All you need is one nutcase with power then all hell breaks loose, maybe you can send him a drone. How can the west just ignore it.
Putin will pay for this
Russia never said he would not attack   Democratic new reporters Leftest from USA
Prayers for Everyone Everywhere🙏🌎❤
It's self defense against the G7 funding Ukraine to invade Russia and remove Putin! He found out the master plan and he moved fast with a preemptive strike on them. Tell us the full story not the fake script in the news media...
My congratulations to Putin and Russia! This planet needs war and more earthling deaths to decrease the surplus population.
Sad seeing this, regular people dont need this. If Putin and Zelensky have problem go box or do whatever dont have to drag others who dont want to be part of the conflict.
The only thing we can do is cut off there resources from the free world. 
It looks like the worst is still coming,stubborn Russia will not back down,let's pray for this war to end now,God answers prayers of the faithful
Judging by the smear campaigns from the media in recent years I'm going to take this footage with a pinch of salt in all honesty.  It's probably footage from Palestine or something 4 years ago.
people gonna hate Russia and Russians.
Yeah sure putin Bot
yeah sure Urkarine invading russia... Russia which got more than thousands nuclear Bombs. How dumb are you
What the fuck is wrong with you
The continuous eastern expansion by NATO has reached the tipping point for Russia. Congratulations.
Bollox, no different than usa going into Iraq or Libyaa and destabilising the area in iraq because they can not comprehend the difference between sunni and shia islam, in a culture 6,000 yrs older than usa's. Just the colour of the peoples
Putin's gonna get killed WATCH IF YOU MURDERED CIVILIANS
THE END IS NEAR! ALL COUNTRIES WILL LAUNCH NUCLEAR MISSILES AGAINST EACH OTHER! WORLD WAR 3 AS PREDICTED!
Oh God,..please help stop this Amen!
Putin had decided international law no longer matters so why is NATO still holding military manpower back. Why not dive in under the same pretense of defending NATO interest in border security of NATO member's?
I can not name a single instance where a war solved anything. Maybe I am ignorant but why war was chosen as a tool is beyond my simple mind.
And your condemnation is coming from a country which subjected half the world. The hypocrisy is laughable!🤣
America was attacking iraq & Afghanistan.Then all the European country was since.
To everyone that 
R.I.P all the civilians that have died
Killing innocent people's is a evil act. The world must kill the evil first to prevent world War lll...
07:50 that's the reason. It is so true what she said
Putin has gone full Hitler.  Poor Ukraine. Who will the tyrant go after next?
Run
Fat faced Putin is getting what's coming to him.........
A crazy way to destabilize and break down the global economy. Sadly, the civilians pay the price while politicians try to prove who has the biggest prick. Bang up job world leaders. Where is nato? Where is the UN? COVID didn’t do it’s job so how about war? Shm. Stay strong Ukraine.
This is so sad
Enabled and emboldened by Trump's support, this creep is now exacting his revenge against the West for the fall of the Soviet Union. He will always be an evil KGB agent. He is a bloodthirsty psychopath.
new Syria ??
Imagine if Joe has been playing dumb all this time to appear weak and incompetent. Russia senses weakness, moves on Ukraine and the only option offered by Joe is a One World Government to save us. Everyone says yes as you’d be a traitor to say no and Joe saves the world. Let’s see if his dementia clears up in the next few days.
why are you lying hey Zelenskiy??? Why?!?!
If you look outside and see surround you are all usa influenced  millitary pointing guns at your direction what will you do? I support  russia in this matter.. Ukraine will not be all taken.. just once half is taken.. then Ukraine be a buffer state.. then u can find peace. But if further aggression... then am not sure
Where is the Ukrainian government? My colleagues I work with every day are disappearing! Is anyone in charge? Their military forces....whatever they have left will need leadership. People are dying out there and will no one ever know about it or why they died? We could've done better. Long live Ukraine.
Well if there’s one thing the world has learned, no one can trust a THING the Russian government says, in fact just assume it’s the opposite. Prayers to Ukraine
scott morrison is gonna start a war with russia and run off
Why do humans have to be like this
UBIT SABAKU PUTINA
Y’all all praying for Ukrainian but no one is talking about the fact America is trying to expand its territory and borders and just using this to do so. Putin been plotting on reuniting the USSR. Both sides are to blame but y’all don’t wanna talk about none of that
So Russia is targeting all of Ukraine not just the separatist east? All them children scared and confused.. I can’t handle this thing.. I was a soldier since 18yo.. Seeing dead kids changes your whole view. I hate war now.. Yemen, Syria, Palestine, Ukraine, Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan and every other place that experienced the suffering of war recently I am sorry for you and your children, keep them safe they are your future.
Did you see the Russian activist struggling to read the script?
This wAr must stop! “In the name of Jesus”!
After this is all done and over, I for one am against any idea of 
This is great news. My bookie line gave me over 12 missiles versus 3 under I need two more strikes to make 50 quid
Lol America should be next, weak leaders weak citizens
So many people hearts are broken in the comments section and rightly so, but they were mostly quiet when it happened in Iraq, libya, Syria, Afghanistan
My heart goes out for children and civilians . This is horrible . Has to stop!!✌️
Psychotic rulers dick measuring and innocent people pay the price. The world's a joke.
Have we not learned anything? 😥😢😭
That was known since Stalin.
 @Slava Kulishko  Yet it was ignored and now our western politicians act as if this came by surprise.
What if Russia claimed they wanted war against America? Do they just assume the complete opposite,thus not preparing for any sort of attack?
Correction: No one can trust a thing any russian says...I am no longer capitalizing the word russia.
 @Max P.  my point exactly
https://youtu.be/L0G9WRRWIuM
And the Chinese government dont forget that
 @David Agaybi  may be you are an idiot?😏. I am bot going to capitalize your name either, david agaybi.
 @David Agaybi  now that's just unfair to the core. You're saying any and every Russian person can't be trusted,whether they wanted war or not? How can anyone be sure YOU'RE any more trustworthy?
I don't believe anyone XD , there are Western Propaganda, Communist Propaganda, Business propaganda, etc, so i don't believe Ukraine either
 @David Agaybi  Wow, you are such a big guy! Not capitalising a letter! You really showed them who's the boss! 💪
 @Ana  It's better than killing my own kind.
Deception is part of warfare . But anyway that stupid ukrainian president should've been more friendly and diplomatic towards his biggest neighbour Russia .I wonder why Ukraine was so eager to call Nato in thier back yards .
 @Yasthafi Azhar  I don't either....you can tell this whole thing is a farce that will end up killing people and extend russia's reach.
 @Nail  and the American govt too .. remember anything about Saddam's WMD ?
 @Rahat Zaman  He is a comedian..why is a comedian president unless he was installed by russia?
 @Rahat Zaman  yeah basically any world power out there
 @David Agaybi  not sure what you are saying .. you mean Russia installed an anti-russian puppet ?
All I am hoping is that this shit doesn't turn into a damn world war 3 .
 @Rahat Zaman  Yes...why not?  If not then Ukraine was foolish to have a comedian for a president.
 @Yasthafi Azhar  Agree with you. People are blind and led by propaganda and media. I like to take a look at the bigger picture and observe as events unfold before I make any personal opinions
USA is weak
Gngb peace ✌️
How is it self defence if you are entering THEIR country
What does this really achieve? I’m disgusted.
NATO where is your  balls?
If there is no action from Europe or the west to this conflict then it’s a green light for Indian state sponsored fascists to commit genocide to its minorities.
What Hypocrisy from Putin , Denazification ? Russia collaborated with the Nazis during the  invasion of Poland in 1939 🤣 !
Self Defense from whom or what?
We watch in horror as people fear for there lives in the ukraine ..This is awful to witness.Pray for all the innocent children ,families, brothers and sisters.,mothers fathers..Peace be upon you all.🥲🙏🏽
I missed this live coverage from all western media over Afghanistan and iraq invasion, as well as Syrian war
Putin’s a complete psychopath and anyone who condones his actions is also an insane war-mongering idiot. This is not going to end well… the world is too tense, we might be on the brink of WW 3.
Look and everyone afraid of war with Russia.. let's  feed useless country to Russia.. we don't care .. Right? till we have full bellies and dancing on tiktok it is not our problem..that is why this world gonna die
It’s horrible but this woke world needs a war…
Honestly speaking, there is something a little fucked up about Europe. Give me a name of one Conquerer who does not come from Europe, just one!!!! It is cool to watch youtube videos tallking about Alexander the Great and Khan, and the Ottoman Empire and all that but when you really think about the concequences which rain on Civilians, dreams  broken, families torn apart, you develop pure hate for what such people were and if you are lucky, you will get over it, if not, you will develop a sense of unfathomable and unhinged mindset whihc seeks nothing but a preparation for far greater war which in turn force you to become the same as the very people you loath. All prayers to the Civilians and children, if i had an IRON MAN SUIT, i'd help but i am just a kid with a keyboard, what can i do?
Nobody believes in Main Stream media ryt now
This is uncalled for I pray for the ram lily ofThe deceased no1 deserve to die like these fear the people who doesn’t forgive and forget 😭
Take what you see on the net and tv with a pinch of salt.
Trump sold them classified military intel for 99.99 cents with a 2 year warranty from maro-loggo and a free delivery!
Please President  Putin stop!!! Do kill children and civilians. Let’s live in peace.  We need peace in this world!!!✌️
This is a total failure for diplomacy. Can’t help to think something could’ve been done to prevent war.

Praying ain’t doing shit
 @tyler bucks  you’re wrong.
 @Amy Sill  yeah sure.
TOYOTA Driver Lives Matter 💯 -Scotty Kilmer
Where u going u in the same boat just like all of us
Fuck your prayers, you naive dumb shit
Help them Lord. Amen.
 @tyler bucks  Praying has saved lives
 @Cris  Now is not a time to argue about prayer while innocent people are dying!
Wow, we did not hear this when the United States invaded Afghanistan. We did not hear it when Britain and America also invaded Iraq. We did not hear when Israel invaded Palestine and killed a people... I hope that the Ukrainians will not be harmed, but let the world know that America and its allies are just nonsense defending their interests only, but even that their interests  They are unable to defend it, they are only fighting weak countries
 @زهراء الزهراء  I’m against ALL wars, period ! Human beings should learn to live with each other, together, we can create a better world, otherwise we will eventually destroy ourselves…
🙏🙏🙏pray pray..
Please stop ✋ war 😭
Just deny NATO then peace comes in.....
This shit face putin is dictator..sanction russia
1959 or 1969.. usa was going to nuclear multiple Asia countries. Including China.  For just pure power grab in the region.... missed by few seconds......due to a heroic individuals not following it thru. if that day did occur.. over 600 million  people would of died.
Well done Putin
BBC your adjectives are wicked unlike your bias reporting
I cant believe this.This is not Putin.Why would he attack his neighbour country?
Pray for us.
Blame this mess on Nuland and Pyatt!
2:45 I may be wrong but it looks like the states potentially withdrawing those 20 f22s they brought into Ukraine?
Where will it end ?
well russia flexed the world watched
Ukraine needs to learn from how Afghanistan handled Russia
Bros playing clash royal irl
I don't understand at 00:21 they don't even react on the bomb that fell near them.
This room is full of sleep. Wake up!! ...
The Russians are coming, the Russians are coming!
I won't watch the idiot fools who you could know are probably war testing 8G on an innocent Country. US is guaranteed not real help. I am telling you that putin a master deceiver is friends with US and what trump biden obama swillary putin, you know all the Worlds most prolific serial killers, have learned in US ORGANIZED CRIME & RUSSIA MOB RUN PHISHINGSCAMS IS THAT IF YOU POSE AND EVEN REINVENT PRETEND HELP EVERYONE ELSE WILL ALLOW YOU TO DO PERMANENT EVIL.
This baldy little shit has got blood on his hands , what goes around comes around, it's your turn soon
In Moscow, protesters go off in police wagens. I wonder how a western government like Canada treat protesters??
Russia is the worst
It’s going to be a short war.  What a nightmare! The Russians are seriously effective.
What a world we are in
Self Defense by bombing civilians? WWIII is coming.
This is so so sad. Im praying for those going through this.
🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺❤️
Well guys. It's been a good run. Guess world war 3 finally starting for real. On the bright side millenials and gen z will die laughing at world war 3 memes. So at least there's that.
weak attack thought it would be bigger and more targets…only 20 missiles was launch
Propaganda at its finest lol
U.S.NANO must help UKRAINE. please bring TRUMP back now he will take care Russia and china before too late .
One thing I find Very Troubling is Ukraine  has 3000 Nuclear weapons at there Disposal. Which is the 3rd most by a Country in the World?? I Feel So Bad for the Ukrainian People. Very Proud People.   This Can Easily Become a Deadly Situation. God Bless You People..😎
If Ukraine president  cares for his people he should of made peace and agreements weeks ago with put in..  instead he pushes for nato and usa support.... keep fighting and the land will have no choice will turned into ashes..
Ukrane must defend there land god bless the people of ukrane and the soldiers at the ground borders,hindi pa tapos ang pandemic ito na naman
God bless Ukraine people.All the nations must to reunite in order to save  Ukraine......remembering Crimea, now Ukraine.....the stupid president mus to be stoped.
Hitler 2.0
NATO should NUKE russia before its too late, this is just the start of world domination
I am with to gave magic powers and can stop these injustice war! Just because putin need power
 @Hairy Rokeke  that would only start another world war. That is WAY worse than Ukraine being occupied
when did prayer actually worked ,,, never ,,, only weapons and strength work the rest are just deluisions ,,
 @Niklas Vilhelm  It's going to end up nuclear. Putin is going to be responsible for triggering the end of humanity. He's unhinged. Ukraine is just his first victim. Xi will probably use the opportunity to occupy Taiwan and then things will escalate over the next few months and eventually, it'll probably go nuclear. That's where we are...
 @Hairy Rokeke  nuke russia ??? you do know that you will be nuked too ,,, are you prepared to die a death where your body is weaporised along with the rest of your country
 @Pete Davis  that would be suicide for Russia. Unless Putin is at Stalin's level of insanity the he wouldn't do it.
 @Niklas Vilhelm  I don't think Putin is well grounded. I think he's approaching that level of insanity.
It has been scientifically proven that prayers don't work.
 @Hairy Rokeke  are you a bot? That's a psychotic thing to say.
Zelensky is too naive and are barking at the wrong door. Be like Afghans, they defeated Russia, the US, and NATO.
Niklas Vilhelm he is paranoid look at his face ice cold no feelings. Putin wants to control Baltic
Putin will drag us all into hell. I can't believe we get to experience Adolf Hitler era all over again.
SCPython afghans have mountains territories that helped them
That's how fast the world is going to shit...your wearing a face mask one day because of a pandemic...next day a armor vest because of war
May God continue to protect you all...
it isnt over, he might take the baltic states, and nato will try to stop putin. and biden said we will back nato.  here we go, another war in the same place that ww1 and ww 2 were fought. this time ww3 will be the last war, because no one will be alive to fight ww4.   what is it about these dictators coming from this same geographical location every 35 years ?
So protests end the same as in canada
you all sent us harry and meghan, we gonna send you biden,  that is a fair trade
This horrible fck
Dear Russian people..this is your time to rise up and stop Putin and get him out of there
We are all at war now whether we get involved right away or not. WW3
Such BS. Hitler also said Germany was defending itself when it invaded Poland in 1939. And Putin saying he wants to 
Democratic world?  Where the fuck is that?  Sure isn't good ol USA
yet not one image of a plane hitting the pentagon on 911.  well thats funny isnt it.
Just feel let down by humanity seeing this.  Honestly….
#nukerussia
Be strong Ukrainia💪🏽🇺🇦
Russia&China world's superpower
World should stop this psychopath, before it is too late.
It's 21 century, isn't it?What the hell,I can't believe what Russia did.
God have mercy on innocent people
Keep it up Putin…take down that corrupt government as fast as you can with the least civilian casualties as possible. Hillary Clinton and Biden families now have to look elsewhere for their corrupt dealings
BBC REPORTS : EXPLOSIVE BUT MOSTLY PEACEFUL INVASION
When I woke up today I didnt think this would happen. I hope everything calms down and things get resolved so more people wont get killed.
Let's be Honest the whole Entire World wanted to see what a Mordern Warfare would be like especially with all the new technology & Weapons that we posess bruh I'm just 15 but its just mad Obvious
Dementia Joe Biden will say and do something to start war with Putin, guaranteed. Russia has the most advanced nuclear weapon on earth, the Satan5 missile. I suggest you all research it. American military heads said afore congress that missile would bring down america in one attack. It splits into like 36 nukes and cannot be deflected.
Why not  Russian remove  Putin  .
Ukraine is not like Afghanistan
If you view the Earth from space, it is beautiful. If you are here on Earth, it is terrible
its painful please God bless the people 🙏
This Putin of a man LOVES WAR! He ANNEXED Crimea from Ukraine some years ago. He also Attacked Georgia too. Currently, he is Involved in the Syrian war. Now it's Ukraine! Why does he like BLOODSHED? SENSELESS!!!!
The world doesn't need this.. we're still  in the pandemic and now in another war.. this is so selfish of the Russian president.... Smh
Where are the allies, come to help? Countries friends?
Putin is a delusional 2-faced psychopath.  He is the only one showing aggression.  NOBODY gives a shit enough about Russia to ever want to invade it.  NATO is a defense organization that has done NO aggression against any other nation.  His excuses for invasion are laughably absurd.  He has been on the record for wanting a return of the USSR; It's clear to everyone all he wants is authoritarian power.
OMG NO WAY FRICK RUSSIA
God protect the Ukraine.. Russian President should stop this Crab
My heart is bleeding, why kill civilians in political man agony. Please we need to stand up for this unhealthy situation.
Girl crying without  tears too lol. dafuk xD
Is anyone think is that horrible when usa-nato attack all aroud world.  Serbia Iraq Iran Avghanistan and more more
Give Those who need Your Strength. Your Love. Those who dearly deserve it. In your name I pray, Amen.
Always ppl that ain’t got shit to do with these idiots paying for they dumb ass decisions
Look ! What Putin did  . This is not  Russian people's  but  Putin 's aggressive  . How ! We will  do  Climates change  . All those explosion  & Bombing  will be  around the air  to breathe in  . Already 300  innocent people died  . They  may not have water to drink  . Please  take  🙏  stand for besides  Ukraine  . Human  destroying  civilization  .
Obama said it best: 
The West is bunch of hipocrats that use human rights cards against countries thos are against them
GreatGrandfathers be turning in there Graves
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Where is james bond when you need him?
Putin will pay for this
You can look in his eyes and there is nothing. He's a sociopath.
Ukraine president seem like he may fold under pressure and everything just got started but i would be scared to if all your so called allies are scared to help you and putin knows this. All they talk about put sanctions on russia and getting tv and talking about how putin is not going to get away with this. Look at putins face, he’s not play no games! The u.s. has been slacking and we have gotten soft. China and russia is starting to surpass us militarily and president biden is incompetent. (Lets go brandon head ass) where’s trump!
Well , If UN, US, UK and .... Not bolls Russian will move next step, Russian will win!
Biden and europe are weak. Sanctions cannot stop the deaths and destruction of Ukraine. The west just played Ukraine and threw them under the bus.
It's amazing how the clergy always stand with the politicians. Wild beast and the harlot in bed together.its the same all around the world.
We need Ukrainian ancestry to come out of their secluded retreat kill putins whole family (I’m not mean but this is equal exchange) and scream: junior who doesn’t know the immensity of heaven and earth, die!
impunity at its best... 😡😡
And they were praising AZOV which are Nazis, and now calling Russians nazis. Lol I would feel so stupid to believe in that. xD
Can’t stop crying 😭 Please God have a little mercy and stop this war 😭
Praying Biden keeps us out of this,  the U.S. getting involved will cause North Korea and China to join Russia, then our Allies will joins and we we be in WW3.Please don’t get us involved, we have helped enough. Have them arms and helped train them. We don’t want our men and women getting killed in a war. We don’t have to help everybody.
Innocent people all at the cost of one man’s greed
How about Syria ＆LYBIA？
Well sit back till they surrender.
In my opinion other countries should not help Ukraine. Staying out of war is the best option. Let Russia and Ukraine clean up their own mess.
This is heart breaking. We dont know what is gonna happen in the next hour/day, many civilians are in danger 😭 Please pray for peace between Ukrainians & Russians. sending love & prayers from 🇵🇭
It's so dodgy, it's not only Putin, there is definitely involved more other country's
We pray for all the innocent people out there who suffer...
I seriously hope they stop at Ukraine. Yes, its selfish as fuck. But if only Ukraine is taken and Russia stops at that and goes back to normal, I'll be happy. Just please don't let another massive war start, I like the economy the way it is
got to love senior citizens always so angry. my favorite part was how he tried to make it seem like they were some sort of threat 😆
My heart goes out to all the people of the Ukraine. If any nation steps in at the defence of the Ukraine it will start WW3.
Didn't Ukraine's president imprison the opposition leadersYeah very democratic
What must we do? Another series of invasions … just like Hitler invading countries one by one. Another world war in our future? We must stop Putin. More pain. More heartache. But, now we must sacrifice
I can't believe its actually happened, no one except the Kremlin, not even the Russian public want this war
The US and Europe are now in world war 3 now.
Russia 🇷🇺 is best country
After 8 years of Ukraine bombing those 2 provinces, world is now awake after 1 day of Russia counteratack. Thats so sad to see. They provoked it, now they should stfu and deal with it.
No🥺🥺🥺
If Russia really decided to invade, there wouldn't be any electricity anywhere or any way to escape Ukraine ..... I can't blame them for being scared of what's going on.... but this isn't an actual invasion..... it's a slap in a face but not all out war
God help Ukraine. God stop this war. God save us all.
Praying for them x
alam ko naman diba?  napakalungkot :(
From Ethiopia
My goodness, the Not-sees have become a Universal villain that it they became an excuse of politicians to hurt and kill people.
Hi from Donbass from Russian.  Neither Russian or Ukrainians wants to be part of “Russian world”. Most of us already left before the war to either Ukraine or Europe.  Donetsk was a beautiful city and look what they did to us and our families!!!
Just crying for those Civilians out there, my prayers goes to y'll 😢🙏🏼🇸🇱
I pray for Ukrainians but not for Russians.
my guy just standing there while people fleeing for their lives
Deja vu, the same arguments, the same cinism, that's the way that the WWII begans, it's Ukraine the new Poland?, by the way Biden really is the new Chamberlain a mix of idealism and incompetence.
ooou - how many bombs left fallen from US and UK jetfighters on Irak, Lybia, Afganisthan, Syria and a long list further - why are you suprised - US und UK are delivering weapons into ucraine for years now - you meant, they never would use them to provoke russia ? Ridiculous... and if you think these provocations from the west are random - see Mr. Freedman from Stratfor in Chicago 5 years !! ago - ...he said - it would be best if germany and russia would fight each other so the influence of the US would never be in danger...
My heart breaks for these people.
Puttin just signed his own death warrant
These demons (Russian Government),,, have a actual history of killing innocent people and next door neighbors not to long ago even in 1980’s…
I wonder what the general public in Russia thinks about this war?
#FREEUKRAINE#BACKOFFRUSSIA
I think Putin is Hotler 2
You think we stupid? Zelensky is a war criminal
Westerners behaved like a herd of wild boars in a cornfield, until they were met by a hunter with a holster!
All the people say 
What about Dombas people…? 8 years daily bombed by Ukranian force ? hypocrisy!!!!
Time for somebody to take down Put(a)in
F@@k  PUTIN-HITLER
Wrong flag
NATO should NUKE russia before its too late, this is just the start of world domination
 @Hairy Rokeke  No, it shouldn’t
The British army did the same thing to Iraq 20 years ago
 @Tyler Walsh  it's his country's flag
 @Tyler Walsh  it's sierra Leone, the comments posters origin country
 @Hairy Rokeke  idiot, no, Russia has more nukes anyway
 @Hairy Rokeke  you dumbass we don't want a ww3
 @Hairy Rokeke  most intelligent American be like:
 @Tyler Walsh  It's his country's flag
Stick to dating boys. This is not a woman’s world or territory.
Wtf does me saying my heart breaks for them have to do with your misogynistic comment. Fuck off
You mean “nukes” I say fuck them, turn Russia into a crater.
You can see  the dust as nato is running away
Be EASY CUZZ NATO ARE ON THERE way !! Ain’t for fun we in Denmark help natoNow we do that !!
JOE BIDEN QUIT BEING A PUSSY AND SEND OUR TROOPS TO HELP!!!  Screw Russia!!!
Ask the people from the Donbass that have been shelled for the last 7 years
oh no
UK & USA - the 2 big SH*T stirrer around the world conflicts.
U all uder estimated him. I did not. I knew he would do it.
Russia will deny hitting civilian targets and blame the west for these false flags
WE AMERICAN CITIZENS ARE PRAYING FOR OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN UKRAINE AND RUSSIA, THE ONLY ONES THAT WANT WAR ARE THE CRAZZY EVIL POLITICIANS! GET OUT MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS GET  TO SAFETY !! MAY GOD BLESS YOU!!
false flag all day long.
The fact that the world is just allowing another country to be brutally ambushed over false claims “noe nazis” is he on crack ? How much more power does Russia need?
When you watch the news about Russia from Western news outlet, you only get 1 point of view. A biased one. Look elsewhere as well because there are Ukraines who actually support Putin. Why did that lady say that she thinks UKRAIN SOLDIERS SHOULD BACKDOWN. Hmmm. Also, imagine Putin taking Boris Johson seriously 🤣 Boris and Putin both said that if Russia attacks Ukraine then Britain and America as well as Nato will join in..... well Putin called their bluff mate. The only weapon Britain and US have is this thing called sanctions. Well, when Putin stops supplying gas then that's just as bad mate.
Let's see what NATO will do now....NOTHING
Already 49have died this will be just a number when it becomes thousands Putin you have blood on your hands for your insanity and desire for war 24-2-22
#stopthewar
Putin is correct, the West was arming Ukraine.
We need to pray, this is the start of WW3. Hopefully we will all survive.
We stand strong with Ukraine, my prayers go out for the people of Ukraine  🇺🇸 🇺🇦
Please put that nazi guy out of their country. We are living in 2000s, that should not be any war. We need to stop him now,, he will not stop with only Ukraine.
Because they have nothing else to do
We know there are many Russians against this move and I feel for them being punished by the world but it's who they have in charge is who they should blame for the suffering and the world isolating Russia. Oligarchs who keep him in power and Putin should be the ones suffering.
My crypto 🥺
This is just awful to witness I never thought a war like this would be possible in my lifetime...
Praying for all.  This is so devastating!
This is the world that we live in so full of hate
The Ukraine has failed to opt for neutrality and have the best of both sides and opted to tie themselves to the Euro-Atlantic side!They were meant to and should be the neutral buffer zone between Russia and Europe!
How the hell did a british journalist get into kyive?
What kind of president mindset is that civilian is innocent on this but why they should be suffering this kind of chaos .UN its your time to solve this.
Hypocrites and claim to love God. And they say they hate evil. Your governments and your citizens have blood on their hands. Keep buying. With the dead people of Syria, Libya, Afghanistan, Kuwait, Vietnam, Japan, Yemen, Yugoslavia, Falkslands.
Maybe someone can educate me, why can't they over throw him.  Kick him out. Exhile him.
I hope Russia gets taken off the map completely. Fack you Russia you cuck suckers
The rest of the world should go together to end that putin dude
Ukraine kik out US and NATO and there will be peace
You should have became a free country to begin with. When Russia turned YOU LOOSE! So the world would have recognize UKRAINE as a free country!   WHAT HAPPEN?  WHY DIDN'T YOU APPLY?  Where trying to help!  but our hands, NATO AND UN are tied. UNTIL THEY FUCK UP!  AND BREAKS A AGGREEMENTS!  FUCK PUDDEN he just a THUG
the new world order started a lot of western shit
Who is suffering for American and British crimes around the world?
I thought there will be no more war but there is...
Afghanistan.  .Iraq . .there have been and will be many more
 @Heavenly  not on this scale
That lead to Nucluar war ...end of humanity
 @Nabil BrH  why? Like the romanov in 1912 they de throwned them.
I don’t think the bbc is telling the whole truth, the mainstream news has its own agenda.
crazy fake christian putin. now reveals his evil color. dumb
Is Russia going to stop this War 🙄🙄 https://youtube.com/channel/UCRdTHiOv23gN5s_L0DthLyw
God be with Ukraine 🙏🏻
Brah u guys are making this shit up all the weapons they got u film 2 old ass trucks and call them tanks I m sure  they can level the whole Europe if they want
We pray for peace and harmony in Ukraine. Russia should cease fire, there's is no need for unnecessary death to innocent people. May the Power of the Holy Spirit take control 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Turtling is a legit strat. Oh and the reich already preambled the script for dispatching Europe.
Hypocrites and claim to love God. And they say they hate evil. Your governments and your citizens have blood on their hands. Keep buying. With the dead people of Syria, Libya, Afghanistan, Kuwait, Vietnam, Japan, Yemen, Yugoslavia, Falkslands.
Hard to believe the bbc lies
I THINK DID YA NOT KNOW THAT OR HOw? And what happen after OL WAS finish and Russia didn’t attach em !!!!
Ukraine knows now west is not a friend .West is only big mouth .Russia are the big power now Ukrainians are refugees now Blame on west
Military airport and targets....don't buy the EU NATO bullshit
War is nonsense. So much destructions and loss of lives.
Hope Putin gets karma
Seeing this breaks my heart into pieces people of Ukraine we're praying for you 🙏🙏 my deepest condolences to the families who lost their beloved ones 😭😭
putin you are the biggest liar going you had this planned for along time you are very cold hearted
Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake while he is committed to this UK American Germany Australia go take Russia spoil the plan
Who can stop this devil man 😡Putin no one help to Ukrainian 🙏🏼☹️
LIKE ANYONE OF YA THINK THAT?!!!
if we dont help them more ppls will lose their lives n famillies.. prayers wont do shit action will help...
 @G̶A̶R̶P̶  what are you going to do to help
NATO should NUKE russia before its too late, this is just the start of world domination
 @Hairy Rokeke  do u want a ww3
Nuking is the worst possible action first we kill innocent Russian civilians second their gonna nuke is back and third that cause nuclear fallout which just ends the world
 @Hairy Rokeke  the problem with that is we would all die it's a no win situation that's on Russia side right now because the world is also war weary and don't want to get into a lengthy conventional war with Russia this was well planned by Putin he knew the United States was to tired to fight
 @lummy  the jet streams would carry the radiation all over the world no one would win I don't know why anyone would even dream of doing such a thing the clouds and rain would be full of it the sun wouldn't shine
I feel bad for the average Russians they look like hostages so sad for both countries Putin should feel ashamed killing them people this doesn't even look like a fight it looks like a massacre I thought NATO had well armed Ukraine
 @Josh Blocker  ‘They look like hostages’ really? And how did you come to this conclusion? I’m sick of westerners spewing this b.SMost of Russia probably do not feel like hostage.
Shut the f up female. You will know terror once again soon
 @Hairy Rokeke  not nuke just defend Ukraine
 @Tom M  you probably live in the west
 @Tom M  Nobody wants this. Not even the citizens, it’s Putin. He’s the one that has killed over 200 citizens and military men.
It's really painful to see 😭😭
Allah ho akbar Allah save Ukraine people from bombing 💣 and rocket 🚀.
ZELENSKY asks for it!!!
It's easy to declare war when you yourself are far away from the front line !It is the common people who are loosing their lives.  Your brother's, father's, sons , daughters, uncles etc. Not the generals and political leaders, they freely sacrifice us for their agenda. However, they never send their children or indeed fight themselves. So sad !
Is sad I though humanity was over this  two bloody wars devastated europe what else
The only way stop russian's invasion is zelensky or Ukraine give up definitively to join NATO.
❤️❤️❤️
Putin Hitler has a serious, evil personality. Small man, big issues
Fuck Putin.  Where the fuck is NATO!?!
I have friends in Ukraine, I hope they are alive and escaped. Thus far no reply from so many messages sent. Dear, God please lookout for the Ukrainians in the struggle of war and guide them to safety! 🙏
Fake news. I didn't see any fireball.

The Ukraine’s President is a nasty man. Sex trade and crime all as he takes a cut.
humans are out of their minds
And what Biden do ? Nothing People says China implemented Biden as president in USA to get all this planned with Russia to a huge war
If its so dangerous ,why all reporters stays with suits and non protected clothes?
Genuine question: Why do reporters keep calling the capital 
Send them to Europe and America and Canada we probably will take on more refugees
The BBC is hardly the most reliable source of information.
If you bend a branch until it snaps beware of the backlash and all its force
Your all taking the piss outa putin to be honest. Stop feeding people absolute rubbish and tell them what putin really says
Praying 🙏 for Ukraine against this madman
Where is Biden now.??....he gave a big talk before....now he is the first one to runaway....
Lies...
Putin is as full of shit as Trump.They just can't stop lying.
This is very sad my prayers are for Ukraine and the innocent civilians living in there homes this is horrible. Pray to the most high  and turn to God.
Сподіваюсь, вся Україна безпечна, сподіваюся, що вся Україна безпечна, я з вами.
What a shame, i thought Putin would be better than that, how can you do that to innocent people...shame on you Putin..your a waste of time...you think this stuff makes you a big man..your just  good for nothing...a waste of space...
Well, here's hoping Putin has secured his place in line for the 
my heart goes to all russian peoples. stay safe🇷🇺
More reasons why Putin has to be ousted. Sending his people on an invasion is just pure selfish. If he wanted Ukraine so bad then why not have a fist fight with Zolensky and prove his balls to his own people former KGB huh? I can attest the sheer will of Zolensky by that time. He will moped the floor with old man Putin.
HOAX 😂
Russian people should do a protest against the government of their own country to lessen the attacks.
Why why we civilians have to pay the price for some one else decision. All our life we work hard under the control of governments. Heavy taxes, expensive education and expensive health systems. Fed up with this nonsense! How many more countries will be damage. Syria, Afghanistan, iraq etc How many more kids need to be cry? How many more hearts need to be break. Why why? Land is enough for need but not for greed!
My thoughts is with the Ukrainian people and it's armed forces
Cowards
The Russian people know how destructive war is. They are crying for the Ukrainian people. And the world should too. We are in the verge of nuclear war and what is coming will come. This will be the end of our civilization,  but not the human race.
The maximum honor for a soldier is to die in combat .
Biden must be happy, so gigantic possibility to sell all army material and ammunition to Ukraine!!
8 лет Луганск и Донецк обстреливают, и всем по фиг.  А ... подождите.. там же в основном русские живут..  ну тогда можно... а теперь, когда получили ответный удар, внимание, не по людям, в отличие  от этих мразей, а по военным объектам, так сразу подняли шумиху. Не забуду Одессу, где мирных людей, вышедших на митинг, сожгли заживо. На что они рассчитывали, снова и снова провоцируя нас?
# War in the Ukraine is not good there will be WAR for all people on earth.
This war is just the beginning, taiwan is next knowing that america and nato cant do anything to help ukraine.
The Western nations are not going to do anything but watch as Russia carves Ukraine up. If they had stopped him in South Ossetia and Crimea he wouldn't feel so emboldened now. He knows the West won't stop him militarily because they fear escalating this into something much larger not to mention he has a massive nuclear deterrent which has been modernised and expanded thanks to that idiotic genius Trump. The only people who suffer in conflicts is civilians 😒
NUKE MOSCOW
the world was slow to react in 1939 with that other MAD MAN,i can not see any difference here,the yanks dont want to know no oil to gain
We all knew russians are terrible people...now they show us that.... hope this will end soon so Ukraine can come to NATO finnaly...Long live NATO
All the signs have been there for around a decade. Yet who suffers out of it the most? The innocent. I cry for the children and babies dying by a murderer who cannot look them in the eye. Fly high angels.
IF PUTIN did this to UKRAINE it can do it to any EUROPEAN COUNTRY !
Did we jump into an alternate universe?
So many fake cry from the women 🇺🇦
Where’s the help ? Stay safe Ukraine 🇺🇦 love ❤️ 🇬🇧
BBC loud-mouth of prostitute called EU. Keep up a good job you cockroaches!
Stay strong Ukraine. This is terrible
Now the world knows how the Syrians feel and what they are going through.  The US still has troops in Syria, WHY?  Russia should demand the withdraw of all US forces from Syria and for Israel stop all illegal military actions on Syria and Iran
Our existence on this paradise like planet is so fu#ked up.
Time for COVID Vs Russian troops
😥
I was born there and this is just sad 😢
Ukraine's liberation is happening!!
Shit news,for idiots special.
This HORRIBLE events should happen on the ground of UK & USA - the 2 most EVIL COUNTRIES in the world.
The western leaders where happy enough to condescendingly warn Ukraine about the invasion they already knew might happen but did absolutely nothing about it.
who saw that mustang👀
War never changes
Russia. Russia never changes.rrLove to Ukraine, from Finland. I wish we could help
We need to remember to support the Russian and Ukrainian people here.  Those are good people. It’s Putin’s fault, and his alone.
Puke-in is an evil, egomaniacal, lying, war mongerer .. thinking he's fooling someone when he vomits statements like 
This guy is guilty of invasion
bladimir putin is a comunist like fidel castro
Isn't this something we should dislike?
Stop spreading your propaganda... NATO is the one true enemy (voice from the UK)
why did Ukraine even start this USA friendship LUL They knew Russia dont like them why provoke them with that....
Iran has vowed to destroy Israel and arms proxy militias that target Israel. Iran is building up military capability in areas of Syria. If an enemy threatened to destroy you and did the same, what would you do? Your username is appropriate for someone who makes such comments.
Dont blame only one leader. Usa and eu leaders bear equal blame for their inability to do things diplomatically.All politicians of the world are the criminals that only care to have voters and money.This situation didnt happen over night.It all began with maidan in 2014
 @Анатолий К.  out of curiousity, what’s your perspective? I’m wondering if different media’s feed us different information?
😱
21BN OF ARMS INTO UKRAINE = RESULT [UKRAINE MILITARY SPLIT ALLEGIANCE]
See how this fake news media . Does the hole 
This has been going on in Palestine and Kashmir over 60 years where were the champions of peace and democracy   nowhere to be seen let the world take its course sit back and relax...
This is 2022 and we still having a war for no good reason makes me wanna puke 😭
Russia is an old country with a steep and fascinating history. The birth of Russia as a nation state cannot be explained without Ukraine. Ukraine constitutes the epicentre of the formation of Russia politically, culturally, philosophically and religiously. Putin has a powerful case to restore the territorial integrity of old Russia especially in circumstances when Ukraine pose a constant threat to the security and survival of Russia. Any astute leader who has studied the work of the great Machiavelli would take a similar decision.
That’s what happens when DICTATORS REFUSE TO GIVE UP THEIR POWER ..
Summary : This is pretty fucked up.
I am a hacker I was right  That Russia was invading Ukraine in Beginning
This is bad
Looks like I'll be trading in my USPS uniform for a US Army Uniform.
Help us, I from Ukraine
This guy is actually the worst human being ever he’s probably worse than hitler he just doesn’t care about anyone
These are just regular people. Putin is directly responsible for each and every one of their deaths. He will burn in hell for this
These people are so brave.
Why is Putin being such a clown?
Put in needs to be arrested and tried in the world court. And pay restitution
So Russia has invaded Ukraine. Putin is going in to protect people who have had to deal with bullying and genocide. Also to basically drain the swamp to bring to Justice those who committed bloody crimes against civilians and Russian people. Biden,Turdope and the other countries owned by the deep state are going to denounce Putin and rail against him. They hate Putin and want everyone to hate Putin. These sanctions they are putting in against Russia?  The only people who will be hurt is all of us because we’re going to pay the price in rising fuel costs and living costs. Deep state puppets like Biden don’t give a rats ass about the American people or the Ukraine people. This is about Biden protecting his own assets and corruption in Ukraine along with the corrupt UN. This is a war of dark against light. We are not dealing with flesh and bones but principalities of darkness and pure evil.
And how does the Ukraine threaten the security and survival of Russia? You must be a paid troll.
Metro Last Light becoming reality.
Blah blah...most will run away!
I my prayers go to the Ukrainian people 🙏
invasion? seems like NATO is about to fully infiltrate ukraine. I can see russia politics have no choice left. Use your brain to think about what western politics did before accusing Putin. NATO and Russia politicians are making their business out of the line to innocent people
What a CROCK OF SHIT .. BBC bias at is worst .. I hope one day the BBC and those who back it get what they deserve
Flaying alive is too good for Putin.Where's Roose Bolton when you need him?
Love from US 🇺🇸 ❤️ 🇺🇦
Yeah, i don't know. This is a Russophobic BBC video afterall. Chances are that we're watching something they filmed back when they were getting their asses handed to them in Iraq.
I woke up to this.
Small countries are helpless to the big countries.It is as if' might is right'.
Putin is a modern day hitler horrible man
What's the problem? It's a stagged event for asylum seekers.
I  no longer beleave in God, but there was one I  would wish they will all be watched over. Putin the poisonous!
this is mostly for what Ukraine did to Russian citizens, Odessa 2014 (they closed the building and set fire to living people) and of course revenge for shelling the areas in Ukraine where the Russian people live,Putin should have done that a long time ago in 2014, but even now it is not too late
This is utterly devastating and heartbreaking. No one in their right mind would ever want a war. What threats can the Ukraine really present to Russia??  We are still trapped in a 20th century aggressor paradigm...like WW2. China may also take advantage of this situation too as the west is distracted by Russia. We need to stop Putin now.
Prayers for Ukraine
Why they all running away stay and fuckin fight, oh yh don't worry us British will fight your war for u
Disgusting
How much money has the UK government accepted over the last years from Russian investors? Again it’s over oil/gas pipelines. Money. Man on the street with flak jacket, man on roof with a nice warm scarf. Study the reporting folks. Politicians should sort this without growing conflict. Fuel prices will increase. We are the losers for all the politicians manipulations.
yeah lets sit in traffic instead of going to ur local bomb shelter.
we should choose animals as our leaders humans only doing damage to each other.my heart is devastated because they waged war on such a beautiful country n people just for their own benefits.
The USA doesn't care about Ukrainians, make no mistake the USA and NATO will eventually come in and clean it up if Russia fully takes over Ukraine, however the USA and NATO are waiting for the war to pick up and for the Ukrainians to take the initial brunt force of the Russian attack, naturally the Ukrainians despite having decent military forces will lose, because the Russian force is just much larger. That's the point when the USA and NATO would step in, when the war won't be as hard, they can still pose as the saviours, and even better yet they can easily take control of Ukraine themselves as it will be in ruins.
Putting needs to be taken out.
Russia should do the same israel did to palestine
The west is a good teacher. The Russians learned from the west
Stop coning people. !!!! All  is just  propaganda for West
Russia has one of the largest land armies in the world, and with their military build up since Putin came to power they are definitely not going to give up anytime soon. It feels hopeless for Ukraine, though I definitely hope that is not the case.
What ever in defence, who's bombing your (Putin) country. I smell a warmonger once again. R.I.P TO ALL UKRAINIANS THAT HAVE PAST THOUGHTS ARE WITH YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS. MAY GOD BE WITH US ALL  🙏
let it happen to Europe  you all sponsor wars in Africa and middle east but you people say nothing, i hope one day USA goes under occupation
And so… it begins
God made the Heavens and the Earth. Satan created Russia. And Putin.
Laydown your firearms and talk to putin in peace and save your people.
Why is nobody helping them nato
Where's NATO and it's army to fight the Russians
Why does war still happen? Haven't we learned anything after all these years and all those lives lost? Wealth and narcissism continues to rule the world. Isn't it time for brains?
I hope the people of Ukraine give them a bloody nose, make it a damn hard fight for Russia.  If only to embarrass Putin and show him even small countries won’t just back down to a bully.
And Trump congratulated him.
time to start learning russian
Just like what Hitler did 😒
NATO giving training to civilians guns and missiles where are they ? looks like that was publicity stunt it's 21'st century and they are not fighting against terrorist groups or militias. NATO left ukrain buring in war. God bless innocent people in Ukrain.
5:14 r u sure about that
First the nazis had to attack Europeans now Russia again wanna Attack 🤯it not fair for anyone even citizens living in both Russia and Ukraine
Nice shot
May my Lord God keep you all safe from this war...I pray Lord hear ours prayers
My heart absolutely bleeds for the citizens Ukraine. God Blessings to you
Let's give each other some love and peace

Sad but the missiles the media is firing in hyping this war is far more deadly than a few strategic missiles launched at military targets.
We should be hitting them now.
I'm 1/3 Ukrainian 1/3 German and 1/3 English. I'm canadian. I think theres A LOT of people looking to be liberated right now, hint hint.
1 leader commanding millions of soldiers! I probably turn that missile to wards that leader to save the innocent!
if anything, US and UK has been provoking Russia, just as guilty!
3rd world war is coming. just wait
So there’s only 1 family in the “Bomb Shelter”? Great bias reporting
Only suffer innocents people around the world from few leaders control the world  that's not democracy,  the people will not living in peace until dissolve weapons and armies around the world and only police forces allowed for governments around the world,  establishing one universal force multinational to protect the world overseas and etc , the security council shouldn't limited for US, UK, France, China and Russia,  it should be by majority votes only , no one should has the veto right , it's some kind of racist and discrimination policy
What about the hospitals
2022 and we still have wars.....god, where is that promised meteor?
Who the fock is this old man think he is.Which have to eat when he,s hungry.Drink water when he,s thirsty.Putin you have your turn to.
^^^^^^^^^^^^r   Understand Your Existence
I've just been seen putting some spiders eggs and vanilla candy cherries on my Christmas 🌲 tree 🎄🧎🏼‍♀️
BBC British Bullshit Co op
TOTALLY A PSYCHIATRIC WAR CRIMINAL. SHOULD BE DEALT WITH SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES. BRING HIM TO NURNBERG FOR HIS WAR CRIMES.
Why did this happen from a war monger whose been baiting for this for years ,will the world stand by and allow this to happen, how can a country that's on its knees ,being a threat to Russia , this Putin is a lunatic, he's sponsored attacks on foreign countries namely using nuclear poisons on anti putin policy opponents , which he's denied with a smile he's a rogue gangster running a country , to me Hitler comes into mind if he's not stopped ,
In the name of the father the son and the holy spirit..help these people in Ukraine.Man will destroy the world..
We need to pray may god help them
I hope nato and the UN decide to get involved, justice for Ukraine!
Putin has lost it, he's insane, he's a goddamn dictator!!!
Lucifer looking for blood to suck.. so sorry for them  in chock ,die,last n lost any family member. What a scary world we r living in right now no one are safe in this evil world control by blood sucker.
Putin: it was only self defense Proceeds to bomb a airport and civilians
This country doesn't stand any more of a chance than a snowball in hell. It's like a lion fighting a mouse. And not one western country will send them troops, weapons, air support, or ammunition. They all just stand there saying 'woe is me,' and ringing their hands.
Can you imagine all of the innocent people and kids that lost their lives at the airport ?
Thanks to Dr Qadir khan for Making Pakistan nuclear charged country Allahu akbar
He blames Putin   this Ukarian leader fits the profile of being in Bill Gates pocket.
Totally, totally unacceptable. Russia seems to be trying to overturn the international order using the might of it's military industrial complex. Setting Ukraine on fire will set much of Central and Eastern Europe on fire. European Union (Germany and France) as a superpower should use diplomacy to staunch a prolonged calamity.World should pay attention to impoverished Hindu fundamentalist India ruled by RSS BJP cabal from Gujarat (financed by remittances and donations from immigrants in America, UK, Europe, Kenya, Uganda, UAE, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudia Arabia..). India is planting chaos, oppression of Christians, Buddhists, Muslims, 400million Dalit Untouchables and calamity in inside patchwork ragged India; and also South Asia. Hindu Nepal, Buddhist Sikkim, Buddhist Bhutan, secular Muslim majority Bangladesh, Buddhist-Hindu Sri Lanka...
Ladies and gentlemen this is a fraction of how all the Islamic Countries felt when the west invaded and dismantled their countries.
It’s weird how NATO makes a big deal out of it though. What about the millions of kids they have bombed?
 @Trips  you keep trying to switch the attention off from what Russia has done. Classic move 😂
 @autofilms atf  What’s wrong with exposing the blatant hypocracy? Not that Russia’s actions today even remotely compares to what NATO has done.
 @Trips  NATO will destroy your will leader Putin! Remember that little man wears high heels! Little man Putin will get stomped by NATO!
 @Trips  Your leader is a little balding prick
 @Trips  When he starts world war 3 what will you say?
 @Trips  Putin is 70 and realizes that he has about 10-15 years left before he dies. So he want to cause as much trouble before he’s forgotten. That little Devil is working for world destruction
 @Trips  millions of kids? Your over exaggerating
 @autofilms atf  I think we all know who’s military is filled with gays and wears high heels here bro... Don’t fuck with Russians, or Colombus is gonna have to discover you again.
And of course no media gave them stage to air their problems, so tell me how does it feel?
I am from Afghanistan, I can understand the pain of getting torn by war and super powers Like Russia and USA, my heart is shattered for the people of Ukraine 😭😭😭, the world should not let this happen, this should be stopped.
Ukraine Britain stands with you❤️
go ahead my lord Putin, not a step back.
Must be one of those “peacekeeping” missiles.
Sooner or later Karma  will find Putin
See! Russian civilians don't want war
🇷🇺🚀🇷🇺🚀🇷🇺🚀🇷🇺
Down with Russia or die 🤷🏽‍♂️
Puttin is a Nazi what he did after ww2 was worse than what Himmler did to the people.
Will stupid humans ever just stop being brainless and heartless and be nice to one another. I hate this world. What did those people who live there every do to deserve that.
Seems like Putin isn't able to handle his power.Hope it gets taken forcefully from him, by Humanity.Next is China with their concentration camps.
Buckle up it's about to get worse. Way worse
They should have thought of that yesterday getting out of the city. Little slow in the head
Noice
more russian civilians will oppose war once the dead bodies of their sons start coming back in closed coffins
Just how naive is the ”western world”..???
Reminiscent of the start of WWII
الله جل جلاله دزمونګ په افغانستان باند رحم فظل اوکر امين ثمه امين
How? If NATO gets involved millitarily then WW3 begins. Even if Russia is truly beaten by conventional warfare, Putin would launch every nuke he has to take us out with him. Our only hope is the people of Russia. They are the silent majority, if they stood against putin they could remove him and his henchmen.
The US didn’t start shit with Afghanistan. The taliban did by killing innocent people in our country.
 @Justin L  the US funded and armed a group of fighters against the Soviet union during the Soviet invasion in Afghanistan. Those freedom fighters turned into what is known now as the Taliban. So yes it is America's fault for not minding their own business and always getting themselves involved in every countries affairs.
 @Justin L  wooosaaa. America didn't do nothing? Ummm were you born last night?
Why did Afghanistan bomb NY.  You declare the war first
 @miso ito  because USA founded Taliban to against Russia invasion,  So there is no unjustified for you of Taliban’s  Killings of innocent Americans
 @miso ito  nice tin foil hat 😆
Y'all are lost
 @Southern- -Red  how?
 @miso ito  As opposed to Russia invading Afghanistan? A true view of history shows insanity on all sides. Maybe we don’t deserve this planet. If we don’t stop this partisan behavior, we are all done. On a radioactive planet, none survive.  Not the US, not Russia, not Afghanistan. No one.
 @Whoami691  How will the people of Russian stop Putin and his 
 @Miguel Servetus  Not all the planet will be radioactive and definitely NOT all of Russia. :) I say launch the bloody nukes and to Hell with all you parasites!
Noice
Poor mustang
De nazification, look in the mirror putin lad.
I pray for Ukraine innocent citizens .
man this is really scary it's horrible I hope the people will be ok and evacuate already. man I hope ww3 will not happen
How dare Russia has the cheek to invade Ukraine there are lit people there who wants to live 😡🤯
If we don't do something now every country in the world will be waking up too bombs wake up world
Destroy ukraine fully God bless russia they have te right to protect them self
Ww3 will be the end of humanity.. theory to be proven..no intelligent life passes a certain threshold.. they ultimately destroy themselves
Why NATO is not helping ukraine? Just blah blah blah. It seems they are afraid of russia! Smh
Nazis are in Ukraine?.......
These are FAKE MASONIC NEWS. As usual. These are Ukrainian forces attacking Donetsk and Lugansk (containing over 80% russuan population) because those republic declared themselfs independent, and Russia recongnised their infependece, Ukraine believing in possible future steps of those 2 republics go over to Russia, thus Ukraine see this as a Ulrainian teritory steing by Russia. Un short, these are Ukrainan attacks within those 2 rebels republics, considered by Ukraine as 
for all you people that feel sorry in the commentsgo help them then
Did Russia really do that??
De nazification???
I hope more people there are willing to fight. A Russian woman who was interviewed said she thinks it’s terrible and the Ukrainian troops should just surrender… Absolutely not.Fight for what’s yours. If it’s truly what you consider to be “home” you should defend it with your dying breath if necessary.
🇺🇦
Pray for Ukraine 🙏🏻🙏🏻
Russia is killing in Ukraine, how are they protecting themselves?
easy for you to say sat behind your keyboard.  best thing for ukraine to do now is surrender and accept they were just being used by america all along to antagonize Russia.  you are not qualified to tell ukrainians to commit suicide - do you know how easily Russia could squash ukraine?  no you don't - you think some guy in a hole with a gun is 'fighting' - it's not, war is mechanized now.
I feel angry at what she's saying. It really frustrated me that she dared to said that, cause why should Ukrainian surrender? It's their Leader that started this war and yet she want Ukrainian to surrender? Does she understand what would happened if Ukrainian surrender? Does she think if Ukrainian did surrender, will the war stopped? It's absolutely idiotic to start a war especially with the covid situation, it will definitely worsening their economy and overall made an impact on the world in the worst case.Absolutely no, Ukrainian should not surrender. Please hold on a little more longer Ukrainian, just a while more longer. You will getting the help that you deserved.
Putin is so pathetic he needs to grow a pair 😡🤬
Wow that is horrible god bless Ukraine 🇺🇦 and why is US not helping I don’t understand
What are we waiting for we need to hit Moscow and all the Russian cities teach putin a lesson sanctions are not good enough
Don't go in NATO and it's over
I feel bad being in a country allied with russia
you must be ignorant if you believe russia and china.. when they say they won't attack you and yet you see the signs they are coming... and if you don't prepare then your doomed it would be just like this..
Bless all the people
F$ck off BBC! You are the national news outlet for the country that promised Ukraine protection if they gave up nukes and now you get a story that should have not existed if you weren't liars and cowards. Eat sh&t
@7:39 Don't worry sister your part of world is coming to Peace & Happiness .
This is all balls
In time of troubles no one can help you but your self alone, other people showing their support nothing but pity😢😢
Learn about the illumati, learn about VRILL, learn what our world once was TARTARIA, he is removing ILLUMATI strong holds. BBC is nothing more than pure propaganda ! Ask why there are thousands of earthquakes @ 10 meters deep all over the world. You are seeing the biggest military takeover removing deepstate illumati.
Like in Belgrade 1999 when NATO was bombing.
Is anybody crying when NATO attacks Serbia 1999 shame you
Half the population want to go back to being a part of Russia, why not Interview them? Why one sided? And if Ukrainians think they will defeat Russia… yeah no.. that’s not going to happen. If Russia really wants to take over Ukraine, they would do it within a months time.
🙏🙏🙏 to the Ukrainian people   from 🇬🇧
Where is NATO now?
Thank's Biden supporters
As a parent I cannot imagine the feeling of helplessness these parents are feeling prayers to everyone in Ukraine! 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽 Fuck Putin!!!
if the PEOPLE want to belong to Russia, let them decide democratically, don't force a war on a whole nation
NATO and Russia have nukes NATO needs to be careful to avoid all out Nuclear War which could kill everyone on Earth. Ukraine are not in NATO so they have 0 obligation
 @Colonel Sanders  West is the trouble causer
Russian people do not support war!
Western world are sitting ducks all lip service and nothing but sanctions with no affect. Slava Ukraine
the fact that i was in school when this shit happened and i was complaining because i had a test, this is much worser. Imagine all those kids in school and a random rocket fire just comes.

Covid hasn't ended and now this... 😥😭
Please block RT main Russian propaganda TV station in Europe and USA!!  They glorify the WAR against Ukraine!!
that short haired blonde, absolutly delusional
Unprovoked and unjustified violence.  This is mass scale murder. Pootin is evil.
---THERE IS NO SMOKE WITHOUT FIRE!!! THE UKRAINIANS MALTREATED THE RUSSIAN POPULATION LIVING IN UKRAINE AND PUTIN WILL NOT TAKE IT ANYMORE. UKRAINE CAN PLAY THE INNOCENT ALL THEY WANT BUT UKRAINE IS FULLY RESPONSIBLE OF RUSSIA'S STRONG REACTION TO UKRAINE'S ATTEMPTED GENOCIDE AGAINST THE RUSSIAN POPULATION LIVING IN UKRAINE. PUTIN IS TO BE COMMENDED TO SHOW SUCH A STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE, WHEREVER THEY LIVE, BE IT IN UKRAINE OR ELSEWHERE. ---WHO COULD SAY THAT IN THE WEST? WHO COULD SAY THAT THEY ARE READY TO FIGHT FOR THEIR OWN PEOPLE WHEN THEY ARE IN PERIL?!!! WHO??!! I HAVE A HARD TIME NAMING A COUNTRY IN EUROPE OR EVEN THE US!!! ---JOE BIDEN ABANDONED MANY AMERICANS IN AFGHANISTAN AND INSTEAD HE BROUGHT BACK AFGHANS WHILE AMERICANS WERE NOT REPATRIATED IN THE US!!! CORRUPT JOE BIDEN NOW WANTS TO TELL PUTIN WHAT TO DO IN UKRAINE WHEN THE LIVES OF MANY RUSSIANS LIVING IN UKRAINE ARE AT STAKE??!!! JOE BIDEN IS A PIECE OF SH-T, NOTHING LESS.---JOE BIDEN IS A USELESS, AND ESPECIALLY CORRUPT PRESIDENT WHO WAS BOUGHT BY UKRAINE WHEN HIS SON HUNTER BIDEN WAS PAID TO 
Better let Nato to Ocuppy everything on earth, fuck bbc bs.
Shame on All of You !
The sad reality of today's world is that the superpowers can  disregard international laws  at will. They  invade and crush smaller  nations  without  any  strong  opposition. The World  couldn't stop US invading  and dismantling Iraq in 2003 and now  is the same  for Russia.
I am hoping for the best safety for the children, please protect the children.
How sad. And how disappointing for Russia. The world will not trust you guys anymore.
Call Trump
It would be nice if the army just decided to NOT participate. Such puppets! How can someone agree to participate in war and be fine with collateral casualties. Go dish it out where there’s no civilians instead!
I simply,can not watch this crime ,peacefully .West Democracy...where are you ?Will you defend Ukraine only with sanctions ????
US and EU are barking over the wall :))))
You don't?
 @Jasonite _Gaming  i don't
 @Арина Накарякова  you live in Russia? How is it there with all this happening
 @Jasonite _Gaming  yes, I'm Russian. Most of people are against war. Many people are protesting against it and being arrested for that.
 @Арина Накарякова  I'm so sorry... your president is like a Hitler
 @Арина Накарякова  Can you teach me Russian?
lol so many false in tears....why you dont cry 2014-2022 where all time been atack Donbass LNR and DNR....You dont want peace, and scream ITS RUSSIA ATACK... NOW Russia atack and you bork like a dog/ Its disguasting...
I agree War is completely wrong and killings of innocent people is wrong , but yet here we are all saying it's wrong and that but what about Palestine, Afghanistan,Iraq,Libya, etc the list goes on .....why ain't any of the countries or NATO help them but instead they let the US and UK send there troops for a war that had no meaning to it ,Ppl are dying in Palestine everyday because Israel is attacking and no one helps, it's the same thing but why give this more coverage because it's closer to the US and UK , I am against all Wars, best solution is peace .( I won't reply to no comments so goodluck and I will stay with my opinion)
I'm praying for the kids :( imagine how they feel
That's bullshit that Ukraine is any threat
Russia just made the biggest mistake for its country and people. Dictator Putin, you are a coward and not a leader. Russia is weak and only looks strong next to a country that is weaker than it's own.
this is terrible and horrific everything is fine until 1 one person needs to prove himself he is powerful but all kings always fall
Well FUCK
Wow..👀 it's sad 😭😭😭💔 God show your strength with that war
I think it's time to attack our own government if they do stupid sh!t like this. They're the only people who wants war. Not the citizens. Sheesh.
BBC wanna asking do you remember when US troops and Uk attack iraq without manded from UN?This is the way US and UK show to the world in the name of WMD!And USA keep interfere by sending money to support  opposition parti in any country they don't like.yes US send money to Russian opposition parti! Not only Russia ,look at arab nation we all knew who's behind the collapse of arab countries like Syria,libya and others..look at Malaysia today..the old government collapse because of hiding hidden hand! We knew america behind! We knew that money come from US for a dacade ..Look at Malaysia today! No political stability, economy down because of misleading and corrupt new government.. they're more corrupt from previous governmentand the people of Malaysia today became a victim!This is because of America policy ..
Russia just wants everyone to be as sad and depressed as them
Only indian prime minister can make a change
As an American, my heart hurts for the people of Ukraine. My prayers go out to you for safety and peace. As for my President and every other international political leader, maybe if you were on the front lines then you would think twice about the selfishness and greed you're showing. Think about your actions beforehand!
Lol!! Where's the popcorn!!
So much propaganda from the west, UK, and EU it’s not even funny. How do you guys believe everything you’re told from government’s who clearly don’t give AF about y’all and in the end they will be the ones profiting from a war while the peasants have it the worst. And still knowing all that y’all still blindly support the ELITE Globalists that are behind pushing a war when it isn’t how they say it is. In the end your kids and daughters will be the one giving their life for leaders who don’t care about them, let alone you. Ignorance tss tss tss.
SUPPRESSED COMMENTS!!!
Good luck Ukraine.  I hope you do not have to stand alone.
This is heartbreaking to watch prayers from the Philippines
Praying for Ukraine 🇺🇦❤️🙏🏻
It was a bit reassuring back then when Putin said Russia wouldn't attack Ukraine... I felt something was off, and now... Idk why's this still happening in 21st century... We had no reason to... Even if there were a reason, shouldn't resolve to this... 😥
Same
What about people of Iraq, Afghanistan,Siria,Livia??????
 @traser75  hmm...ten years in Afghanistan, two wars in Chechnya, Georgia, Crimea and now Ukraine. No wonder all of Russia's neighbors want to join NATO.
 @jcoolG19 2  Like Americans says 
 @traser75  nope! Same thing.
 @jcoolG19 2  Explain that USA government
Bible prophecy coming to pass
That's no Russia, thst's Amarcan's attacking  pretending to br Russia, FACKING BIDEN!!!
all because some world leaders have an ego
Putin should think twice. War is not the solution. We the ordinary citizens suffered, much more old and children.  Our kids deserve peace. May peace prevail 🙏🏽😢
Put Putin said he was going to do this, and yet everyone is surprised...really?
La muerte al presidente de Ucrania   El es culpable por querer darse el culo a otro países
War is a Waste. End the madness
If the USA gets involved watch China do the same.
The 2 buildings are buildings where there was a gas pipe explosion and not with missiles.My friends in Kiev are happy to see Russia destroy the Nazi army
What about the children
YOU NEED TO STOP THE BIDEN FAMILY FROM GETTING RICH OFF OF UKRAINE !
When will the media ever tell the truth, there is no takeover of ukraine. It is a specialised military operation targeting far right extremists who flaunt nazi flags. The real criminals are the mainstream media who once again lie, distract and keep people living in fear with WW3 claims
1. The symbols used by Ukraine or forces are ancient pagan symbols not far right or nazi related, in Eastern Europe these symbols are not taboo like in the west. 2. Russia has always done things like this to its neighbors. Throughout Russia's history there's never been a period of 
Kinda weird how every time Russia tries to “liberate” a country, the people there don’t want to be liberated. Odd…
Horror, pure horror. My support from canada goese out to the ukrainians and the russians who are bravely protesting against this war.
Putin is a liar like his pal Trump.
Im glad i live im the Philippines, we're peaceful here.. War doesnt exist here. This is sad news.
Ukraine has no chance i jope i m WRONG
Praying for all the civilians for their safety. May God keep you safe.
😒
Ameen !!! And I put allah in to this !! CUZZ I know that allah gonna make it good like all ways !!
Hey Diane how are you doing today
Not gonna happen.!
Soooo sorry to say... God must be busy with other pressing matters 😩
 @Crystal Lee  God is not responsible for the actions of man. This is a corrupt and evil world. Bad things happen.
This is a bad dreaM!
Putin needs to be taken out asap or he will bomb more country in the future
Adolph Putin Interesting he uses a word like 
They only attacked Military sites. Stop the bs
My heart goes to ukraine may God be with them🙏🙏🖤🖤❤️❤️❤️💛💛💛💜💜💜
unverifired? german tv sells them as legit?
i am ukraine ， I'm ready to be Russian
So sad, praying for all the ukraine 🇺🇦 people.
This is just because of the ego of one person Putin. Russian people doesnt have anything to do with this.
It’s almost impossible to imagine how the russian soldiers could be motivated to invade their neighbour country and to kill their Ukraine brothers and sisters… there must be serious brainwashing going on in that army/country….
Putin you mean “Hitler the second”.I feel so bad for the innocent people.Try and be in their shoes ,on how scary it must be.
Fears for his job, Putin will execute you
Russia is a police state.The entire Russian government  and all the insiders should be terminated.Starting with Putin.
These things are prophecied in the Holy Bible. Those who pay attention to Biblical prophecy are not suprised. I know I’m not, I heard about this years ago. “You will hear of wars and rumours of wars”.
Well the Clintons dream of a war with Russia seem much more like a possibility/probability.
Make love, not war. I'm crying.

“This is the Kremlins war”. So painful to watch. My heart is breaking for the Ukrainians and for the Russian people who don’t want this either but will suffer under the sanctions. 💔
Protect Ukraine to become like Syria,...iraq
What coward nato doing?? Morons rush for help or can show manhood. In middle east only
https://youtu.be/L0G9WRRWIuM.
😒
Try to be in a shoes of people from lugansk and donetsk who had to go through all that for 8 years, being attacked by their own country
 @Анатолий К.  and that justifies war on the rest of the people in Ukraine? why not punish the ones who made the decisions and leave others alone?
They deserve the sanctions. If they are truly opposed to this war, they will stand up to their government. If they do not, every Russian will be responsible for every death in Ukraine.
The Russian people overwhelmingly support Putin and his war. So I have no sympathy for the Russian people.
​ @Matthew Huszarik  its lie.Are u provocateur
This so sad so of you can come over to Dubai UAE
 @Matthew Huszarik  im Russian but I live in the UK and most Russians have been tricked by propaganda and it is unfair that you say all of them are responsible. You also can’t do anything to stop Putin as you will die
 @North  how do you stand up to Putin dumbass
What's putin without suporters
 @Alyx  The Russians overwhelmingly support Putin is directly from friends and relatives living in Russia. I haven’t seen millions taking to the streets and over throwing Putin’s criminal regime so I have to assume what I was told, by trust worthy sources is the truth.
 @North  you’re slow bud
 @Hazed Synth.  The Russians who believe the propaganda are responsible. Just as all Germans except those that actually fought against the Nazi were responsible. You can be responsible by directly supporting or by acquiescing to the criminal acts committed in your name. If Russians don’t support Putin’s war then rise up and overthrow him. Yes you will be risking your live, but don’t you owe at least that much to Putin’s innocent victims in Ukraine?
 @North  don't say Russians, say Russian government, civilians have nothing to do with it.
 @SoLoGLidez  how so?
 @Manu0179  well they're not doing anything to stop it.
 @Matthew Huszarik  Have you guys protested against NATO bombing other countries? no you don't
It's time for the world to wake up and invade Russia and remove Putin and his regime. Nuclear war or not let's put an end to this bullshit,
Putin wants all offensive weapons that can be used against Russia be removed. They have no more buffer states. NATO works diliently to ever expand its influences further and further east. Should they wait until the Iron Dome is parked in Moscow?  How would the USA feel is Russia installed ICBMs in Cuba, Venezuela, and Guatemala?  Ukraine needs to the Switzerland of the East. No foreign weapons from eaither side.
Wow just wow why do that when they did nothing to u my heart is broken
We need Peace not war
Why people react soo much 🤣 r u serious know anything or just saw some fake interview
Putin the war criminal, his people will rise against him after this
Biden is a disgrace
Be strong Ukrainians! you're welcome in my home.
We keep hearing what Russia are doing but what had Ukrainian military doing against Russia's military? Might be another case of Afghanistan where the military just hand it over to Russia.
How about you all google Ukraine human rights and freedoms.
Weak washy NATO coalition and gutless Biden
god bless the whole world we are all human but we have lost respect for others the battle is being won by the devil the powerful there will always be more power
USA went apeshit over sovjet union in cuba and setting up militairy bases.... Now we are confused Russia is having the same sentiment when Ukraine is being used by NATO/USA to get them into EU/NATO and thus also putting militairy bases right on the doorstep of russia ?! This whole situation was either planned for or the west is just incredibly incompetent/blind/naïve when it comes to matters of geopolitics. Ukraine should have been neutral at most and EU should not have tried to get them into EU/NATO even if their population wanted it. Now Ukraine will suffer because of EU/NATO's incompetence. They wanted to see how far they could go with russia and russia is now showing it has limits. Now NATO has to help ukraine because of the declaration they made some years ago or else they will lose face big time, if they have not already. Which, mind you, is not the best situation. Either NATO backs down/not help ukraine and declares it will not try to get ukraine into EU/NATO and lose allot of prestige and trust or they will fight for Ukraine and things will escalate even further which ofc Ukrainian people have to suffer the most for.
Crazy world
This man is stuck in the past, why would you want to bring back Russian imperialism, like.. you have so much land so much to keep, Ukraine is it's own place, the fact he says 
Putin say's Ukraine is controlled by Nazis. Just an excuses so when Russians start coming home in body bags he can tell the people of Russia 
Trump has conveniently left out that his first impeachment was, in part, due to the fact he withheld roughly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine while pressuring it to launch an investigation into Biden and his son Hunter over bogus allegations of corruption. Ukraine has heavily relied on US assistance while fighting a war against Kremlin-backed rebels, the war Putin claims to now be entering on behalf of Russian speakers....
Denazified? Sounds like a bunch of American liberals talking! Lol
God Bless Ukraine🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
I pray to Ukraine, but this is what happened in Arab countries such as Iraq, Libya, Syria, etc., but the world did not care, i hate the duplicity of people,  i do not believe in humanity
Because he’s an insecure dictator who wants to be feared or loved by all and can’t handle the fact there’s a democratic country on his doorstep saying mean things about him.
Yes bro. Freedom an democracy hipocrecy
Putin personifies “judge me by my actions not by my words.”
Mariupol only has a small private-type airport. It is not for airliners and the like.
I'm finding it hard to believe that we are seeing full time Army. Unless they don't train proper combat formation/movement in Russia anymore
💕🇷🇺#StandWithRussia🇷🇺💕
But when the west goes to war.. they are heroes
Ukraine has to surrender, the russian army is very powerful to battle with, ukrain cant
Like the Bible said, 
War is not acceptable at all , please respect humanity
When Iraq bombarded Kuwait,  US intervened quickly I understand why US or Britain can't interven in this case
Ukraine pushed her luck beyond even the most dumb mind common sense. Well... MOTHER RUSSIA is here to teach her some lessons.
God please help Ukraine and it's citizens
Collateral damage?
Ohh God. Russians are great people, like all the other nations. It is the gangster politicians all over the world creating wars.
Another case for rubbish elections not working.  Ribbish such as  Zelensky keep getting elected who is responsible for the attack.  Rubbish such Biden are responsible for NATO agression that push Putin over the brink.
get sarah out there. get her out of there now!
BBC is fakenews
What a cruel act of war by Russia leader. He should be bring to justice for his act.
This is SAD man
You could probably say that about most Russian politicians.
KILLPUTIN...
Videos look like old footage.   Knowing Biden and the other spooks , I’m sitting here thinking this is not real.    Wag the Dog bull💩!!
Biden and the EU are to blame for this...trying to encircle the Russian bear and keep poking it...Russia is defending its borders ..that's the truth of it...
Isto é de loucos, não acredito que estou a ver uma guerra na europa sem sentido nenhum. Um povo a matar o outro a mando de um louco, que vê o próprio povo a morrer e a matar outro povo inocente por ideias parvas e sem sentido nenhum. Mais uma guerra estúpida. Alguém que pare aquele louco.
Biden and UK  needs to initiate drone attacks to destroy putin and stop this madness.
He’s not a human being. He’s SATAN.
2 Esdras 15:46-56 46 And thou, Asia, that art partaker of the hope of Babylon, and art the glory of her person: 47 Woe be unto thee, thou wretch, because thou hast made thyself like unto her; and hast decked thy daughters in whoredom, that they might please and glory in thy lovers, which have always desired to commit whoredom with thee. 48 Thou hast followed her that is hated in all her works and inventions: therefore saith God, 49 I will send plagues upon thee; widowhood, poverty, famine, sword, and pestilence, to waste thy houses with destruction and death. 50 And the glory of thy Power shall be dried up as a flower, the heat shall arise that is sent over thee. 51 Thou shalt be weakened as a poor woman with stripes, and as one chastised with wounds, so that the mighty and lovers shall not be able to receive thee. 52 Would I with jealousy have so proceeded against thee, saith the Lord, 53 If thou hadst not always slain my chosen, exalting the stroke of thine hands, and saying over their dead, when thou wast drunken, 54 Set forth the beauty of thy countenance? 55 The reward of thy whoredom shall be in thy bosom, therefore shalt thou receive recompence. 56 Like as thou hast done unto my chosen, saith the Lord, even so shall God do unto thee, and shall deliver thee into mischief
Usyk won’t be happy
So sad, God bless and save all those people. 😥
Killputinnow...
Seems they can't b trusted
I hate to say this but Ukraine should just give Putin what he wants. He will kill civilians and doesn’t care. NATO will not punish with war rather with sanctions which Putin clearly doesn’t care about Liz
I’m just crying 😭 God please save them
Secret message starting at 08.21? Sounds like someone wispering
Take out Putin!
WhereisuñandNatonow??????
I hope Chernobyl dust falls on the russian war machine.
Where us the footage of all the damage that Russia has supposedly done?
I Hate war, I hate war.I'd rather 1 single shot hadn't been fired. Zelenzky, the Ukranian president must feel betrayed, abandoned, by the West
Sanctions will not stop Putin. The west said the same thing after Crimea. The only way, sadly, is to demonstrate NATO muscle vs his aggression. Force needs to be met with force. I pray for all the people in Ukraine
which god? vishnu?
 @myfoodishere lord jashin 🗿
 @cheemterastrial  i'll give it a whirl
Nato should shove its muscle up the place with no sunlight. Provoking russia with expansion towards russian borders and its blatant antirussian agenda are one of the reasons why all this conflict is a thing. And why ukraine shouldhave stayed a neutral state instead of adopting antirussian behavior
Thats remind me exactly to what happened to Iraq in 2003 it was beautiful country before War.War is the worst thing Can happen to a country.
I have a friend the but I guess we can call her ex friend there that I had a arguement with the last time I saw her but even to we don't like each other very much anymore I still hope that she and her whole family is okay and have had the luck to escapde the country. Of course I hope that to every civilians to. This is truly horrible and scary.
Vladimir 
Poor Ukraine belives NATO,  Zelensky is a idiot.
Damn their already asking for those blood donates
does anybody even know why Russia is invading ukraine?
I've been politically aware for 50 of my 70 years, and make no mistake about it the BBC is abolutely a state propaganda machine.
I hope they stay away from the Netherlands
Adolf Putin/ we remember the last time that the invasion started in Europe ww3 you started it Russia
All it would take is one drone strike to end things
1:20 are you shitting me? What defence? What nazism? He's the portrayal of those two things though more Stalin instead of nazism.
I Really can not believe this. It legit looks like im looking at the news in a dream.this is unreal Bless,Love,give,heart,to, Ukraine  My entire heart and everything goes to Ukraine 2:43 Everyone was leaving Ukraine. Ukraine is a wonderfull place... only if russia was never next to them all those buildings would have been up still.
I love Russia so much 🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺💪💪💪
Amit Sengupta youtube channel explains well the modern hiatory of Ukraine and why this conflict happening!
The Republican Party owns this. Fascist hate-driven anti-American Republican traitors sucking Putin for four years, every republican is a traitor. Putin waited for his people to be scraped out of the White House, now he attacks because Republicans are traitors.
My heart cries for Ukraine. Hope this war will end soon.
I've been politically aware for 50 of my 70 years, and make no mistake about it the BBC is abolutely a state propaganda machine.
https://youtu.be/L0G9WRRWIuM<
why is it a dream ? we literally did the same and worse for 20 years in Afghanistan
Hahahaha Ukraine is lost already, they dared to attack first.This war will have a happy ending if just Ukraine is destroyed. The worst scenario would be a nuclear war.
 @Luis Garcia Garcia  Go cry Russian supporter.
I just hope it’s over, if Ukraine submits or not I don’t want the rest of the world dragged into this and I really don’t want a nuclear war
Ukrainian destroy meny Russian tank, helicopter and jets
It is like a bully beating a toddler with a baseball bat. Terrible.
Не смей стрелять по Киеву! Лучше вместе ебанём по Пекину!
God be with the Ukrainians
Why the civilian reference nazi occupation and not previous Russian occupations?
The most powerful and smartest species on this planet.... However, the truth is...
Just admit it's ww3 and let's bring down this disgusting human nazi 😤
Nato employs financial sanctions. I’ve never seen a more limp wristed response. Appeasement by any other name but appeasement nonetheless less.
This is what Russian peace looks like
Bloody prayers/God, won’t do anything, haven’t you learnt that from history either? Please escape the religious plague of the mind. Putin is a testosterone fuelled, homophobic, greedy, insecure pig with a grudge stuck in the Cold War era who needs to be assassinated for the peace of so many more superior people. The bible’s homophonic too, now do you see the relation.
I know this sounds, I know this feeling, but from 24 years ago...
The sound of those air raid sirens makes my blood go cold.
putin is crazy. Stop him please.
when nobody stopped hitler, we saw what happened..its happening again.  crimea, belarus, ukraine, etc. who is next☹
When will the Falklands RETURN? To Argentina 🇦🇷
Putins lost the plot gone full war mode
God Bless all the people in there city,I’m scary for the innocent people🥺
Ukraine has insignificant forces compared to Russia. How could anybody think Russia feels threatened by Ukraine? One thing is to invade, another is to hold, as Russia and the US have painfully found out in Afghanistan.This will turn into dirty guerilla urban warfare that will drag on for years. The Ukraine will turn into a field of ruins.
Putin is evil
Упс, у вас кажется флот сгорел, авиация на замле тлеет и базы военные разрушены🤡Допрыгались, дети шлюх, за нацистскую шваль
Why are you monetizing these videos? Quite rude really..
Please  stop the war .love each other  . I'm from Philippines.🇵🇭
God damn the American traitors who support Putin and Russia...Trump Traitors.
I hope Brandon got his money out of the Ukranian banks
You can see a person stop walking as soon as the explosions happened in the first clip.
Russia is ofcourse attack Ukraine, but it won't take long because russian economy is weak (ukrainian economy is much weaker) and demographic picture is bad, so they can't have a long war. Only country with strong economy in this moment is china.
One man without mind wants to destroy one depended country, what is going on with this world people?? #freeUkraine🇺🇦
Putin sucks
Seriously stop the i feel bad and god bless them…..They are destroying a country killing infants and unborn children along with their mothers,it’s called terrorism in global scale
I hope Russia falls one day!!!!!!!!
Russia an L
Where is NATO now? Do you want starts a new world war USA and UK ?  Remembers Cuba Pig's bay  in reverse way.
Time for someone to be a hero and stamp their name in the history books. Who’s going to take out one to save potentially millions. All I know is that Putin needs to go
Thank you BBC , excellent report !My take out is that the world wants peace yet Gangsters are taking control and the people on the ground suffer!Please keep reportingStuart in Ireland
When will the Falklands RETURN? To Argentina 🇦🇷
Nobody wants War except America!
Putin is another blind ignorant power obsessed Hitler in the making as of now. It is well.
Why do they reward what's evil for goo,,they misuse thear power
Ukraine bombs also
Putin=Hitler
This really broke my heart. all those Innocent people, i really hope this wont be something really really bad,
For someone who says the Ukrainian’s were one people with Russia, Putin sure doesn’t mind blowing them up.
If it`s to end in fire , then be it so , btch...this life or the other you gonna pay for this...
Where is UNO????? What's the meaning of it's existing?..... These so called all Organisation should cease or stop being exist.. Just taking salaries, advantages and leaving out from the name of these so called Organisation is shameful if it doesn't function and gives any help for the world.
And civilians suffer
Fk you putin my girlfriend is Ukrainian
once you cross a border its war!!!
Fuck Russia
Russia think they will win! But it’s going to turn into a gorilla War which they can never win ever.Hope they are prepared for the bodies to come back.So sad.
Who is Putin talking to when he says Ukraine is a threat to Russia?  Who really believes that?  Certainly not Putin.
God bless you Ukraine 🙏
Thoughts , prayers and heart emojis don't win wars people.
I just want to give props to that reporter he has nuts of steel. Can't imagine what they are going through 🙏🙏
Dear Jesus we pray for an end to this conflict. Amen.
Lord Please Protect those who have nothing to do with this! ❤
Ah is this the peaceful military operation?
No words.
All these people saying they can't believe this is happening have been blind to Syria, to Israel and Palestine and all the other countries where war rages.
America must stop this Hypocrisy!
That is so sad about the Russian invasion of Ukraine and my prayers are with the people there and may their enemy go to Hell.
Babushkas : Make ROSSIYA Great Again 💪🦾
Nato is a threat to russia. Ukraine is a threat for its antirussian direction and desire to get into nato and bring it straight to the russian borders
https://youtu.be/L0G9WRRWIuM
The reporter ??? How about the civilians who live in the Ukraine !!! They are the ones we hve to be concerned about
Not nuts of steel lol
Really?😄
 @peter hansa  the reporter actually chose to go
wow youre naive
 @Internet Safety  exactly. its his job. he gets something in return for taking risks. the civilians who are afraid of their lives do not get heard at all
Ukraine today, who is next???
Wow that’s crazy sad. This is all that guy Putin’s fault 🤨 Prayers 🙏 to everyone. It’s like he is blowing up his own people. This is just wrong 👎
How humans have become evil like dogs, killing each other for no reason,,, it's strange they start a war but they don't go and fight, whilst other people fighting battles they don't know, then those who is responsible are busy eating and living large,,, one day God will punish you all for this innocent blood shedding
When everyone finds out and educates themselves on why Russia decided to do this, all will come apparent and then you'll see how upside down the narrative has been fed to us... Unfortunately the Civilians are taking the brunt of this and with life changing consequences 💔Remember - This is The BBC... When do they ever tell the full truth? Coughs Jimmy Saville
How many other countries, he going to take?
What if they just kill Putin and get it over with
Also Russian citizens are not far from their idiot leader...
Putin, you pathetic little man !
One of the worst day in europes history...
Some body give Ukraine B-52s and some cargo
When a comedian becomes President ,this happens. Sheer madness of the president of Ukraine. You're responsible for putting your legs in the trap of USA and now putting ppl in danger .
Hmm 21st century war broadcast and wo drone cams???  Pssttt
Putin will fall, the Ukrainians will prevail
Shame on Putin for creating war
Russia is going after the little man first, they are allied with china and this plan has been in motion for decades. The biggest, baddest duo of the century, russia and china. The USA must embrace it's 2nd amendment rights now more than ever, we gonna need it lmao
Ukraine president are look more like puppet clown to the U.S...if Ukrainian wanted peace they have to put down theirs weopens..and put down the president.. then Russian not need to use force..
Sorry but y’all dismissed the 14000+ life lost inside your country as number
Nicely arranged piece of propaganda orchestrated by the Ukrainian military
If it comes down to it im willing to fight for u 💙
😂 I’m sure they’ll be calling you
#3thwar?
Respect to all the soldiers and military member’s involved in this situation. My sister and her boyfriend, are part of the US Navy and are currently on seas. Her boyfriend is on a much higher rank and his job involves war. Which means that if Ukraine or Russia decides to throw a bomb to North America, then her boyfriend is sent automatically in the front row to fight. Meanwhile my sister, would only get sent near where it’s happening just to be a “wittiness”.
One day this planet will get sick of this. The movie The Happening says it all.
There’s at least 10 people in this world that need to go missing never to be seen again…then we might end up living a better life
So the reaction of the western world is as expected by Putin. They do nothing. Don't forget Russia is already 6 years, since the annexation of Crimea,  under  heavy sanctions. She don't care, the trade with China and India is unhindered. The gas for North Stream 2 is already sold to China.New sanctions will have exactly zero impact on Russia.Russia don't need the west and this war proves that compelling.Get used to expensive Freedom-gas with a double CO2 footprint as Pipeline gas... Bad news for the climate and your wallet.
International TREBUNAL for Putin regime ---nesessary .!
While america was busy destroying Iraq and Afghanistan nobody stood with the civilians but know everybody is praying for Ukraine
You mean Western of Ukraine? Russia's missile passed through East of Ukraine to West? What is Ukraine's air defense composed of?
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□The whole population of #Luhansk & #Donestsk celebrate their independence. The will of the people of these states MUST #PREVAIL over what Zelensky, #UnitedStates #UnitedKingdom #France or any other nation want & the #InternationalCommunity MUST #RESPECT THE CHOICE OF THE PEOPLE IN THE #DONBASS REGION ---- AND PERIOD!
I hope Civilians are Saved
Russia is The modern day nazi,
I don't blame. Russia. Ukraine is the victim of west. I support Putin for he is doing a good job. Putin is just a man he did what he wants and keep the great job.
America back OFF ,the world will be a peaceful place.
Send in the Apache helicopters
When #US destroyed #Iraq under the pretext of a #WeaponsOfMassDestruction which was later foubd out to be false,  the #UnitedNation  said nothing.  Now, they are so mouthful about #Russia defending #Luhansk #Donestsks.  What a #hypocrite.
I cried for the children and women's God protect them
Is it cause the 9/11 umm airplane attack? 911 energy line... ummm... lol up plane crashes at the Pentagon and Kobe  Bryant and Cook Airlines and maybe started with Southwest Airlines when I took a trip to Cancun with Erik 666 man... theyhave had a jinx since we had to take out all system for our trip to take American Airlines muah Putin, Red Dragon YHWH
It's Putin's war, he is the one giving out the orders. Madman, dictator and Murderer 100% going to hell. The good Russian people who want to live life to the full in peace with all their neighbor's need to do something quick and get rid. One man responsible for actions which is affecting millions. Navalny is a good man and should be President!
GO. RUSSIA
Unfortunately there is always someone to fill their place and sometimes they are worse.
If things were so easy. You are probably referring to the people 'in power' . If it was that easy. You dont seem to understand that there is a whole bunch of people behind them. They are the ones who pull the strings. They are the ones responsible for the strategies that lead to the outcome we are witnessing now.One of the main problems is that the public is too easily manipulated by governments through the media. Nothing much has changed since the 1930s in this respect. We are still seeing 'popular opinion' backing actions that are inhuman and cruel. In fact it is the preparation for these consequences that the majority does not see. Those few people that warn about it do not get heard. They are outside of popular opinion. It happened in the past and has led to numerous atrocities and wars.
ruSSia needs to GO home
To the man who said he's scared for his boy why the hell did you not join the military and be there fighting for your country instead of running with your kids and wife you should leave them and go fight
Pls help us beg boris not to get uk involved it’s Russia we are talking about
Ukraine can not defeat the Russian military.  It's a simple choice; either quickly negotiate a ceasefire and save a great many Ukrainian lives, or fight and be forced to accept unconditional surrender with a great many deaths.
Us authorities should be ashamed of themselves . Hypocrites at their best .
It’s all going to end sometime ‼️‼️ sadly for us the human race only knows war  power and money‼️‼️ and that will never change as shown here in 2022‼️‼️‼️
Putin needs to be taken out.  And nato should not just stand by and let that murderer do this.  Sad.
Tell me. Did you still love russia?
Where is the world? Where is the rest of the world? It will be Ukraine first. Then who next?
Why Russia, why?
Nato can try this game at belarus also after Ukerien!
Wonder how Putin children will see him now. A father who goes down to history by causing war for no reason !!
Father god hear our cry and prayers we ask you to stop this war ....
I genuinely feel so so scared for them. Putin is a absolute nut case. I can’t even think of how the young children feel right now
I wonder what time the nuclear clock is right now?
Hits first. 
I can hear whispering it’s really wired ahhaha

Mercy ABBBA FATHER !!!!!!
Catch a flight and go fight your self
Putin is a nutcase? Lol bush wasn’t a nutcase who literally bombed civilian homes
Nato is the bad people Puttin is fighting evil the kabal history get out
Let's not ignore the real reason this has happened. The so called 'conspiracy theorists' were RIGHT! The weakness of Biden and his fellow globalist puppets Western politicians and the consequent breakdown of the West is TOTALLY responsible for this. I laugh at the comment made about Russians not being allowed to PROTEST!! Where were the MAIN STREAM MEDIA during the assaults on peaceful protests in every country in the West. The media are hypocrits, the Western Govts are hypocrits and now you wonder why Putin thinks he can get away with this. Watch for China next. The Western govts have been so busy taking away our freedoms they missed the boat. PUTIN has been bated by Biden and Western leaders because he's ANTI GLOBALISM AND RESET. Ironically he may be the Western peoples saviour!!!
ow dare that kind of human
Playing the wrong cards by a president is one of the worst things that can happen to a nation. The problem in this case it's the weaker nation... Sorry for the loss of lives though.
The Ukraine men look like a bunch of cowards.. put your boots on and go to war!
PEACE ........NOT....... WAR.......
This isn’t Russia. This is Putin. The muppet must be taken out. Preferably by the Russian people
ITS SOON TO COME HERE, ITS PROPHESY
Unfortunately Ukraine is on its own , this could of been prevented years ago but the West and Ukraine have poked Russia to much
Putin should start wearing a small moustache ...for his de nazification campaign
This is so sad my heart goes out for Ukraine feel so bad about this I just feel like crying for the people of Ukraine God bless and protect Ukraine
canada too.
Shhh, don't mention that Volodymyr Zelensky has been raining down missiles on the ethnic Russian sectors of Ukraine, along with supporting neo-Nazi warlords in Kyiv.
This is so disheartening 💔 I hope the casualties remain low. Sad to know that many innocents will be killed by Putin
We need peace cz we are brotha n sista.
Time has arrived to get rid of Putin' s regime and autocracy.
That's beautiful 😍😍😍😍😍😍
First NATO has to convince the Chinese to not get involved. Then NATO can go in and kick some Russian Butt. Where is a super Hero when you need one.
its ok guys, twitter will cancel putin, we win
Putin and Russia are pathetic
Which god?

🤡
I can imagine how horrible it is being in the country bombarded with missiles everywhere, the fear of the people and the pain of losing your love0nes because of the war.
it is obvious that the West will do nothing as always. Putin can only be stopped by a solid defense of the Ukrainian Army and partisans.
And Trump thinks Putin is smart.  Well Trump supporters do you?
They're trying to rip up eastern Europe for their belt and road initiatives and agreements with China and Israel. NATO is also in a bad place where Russia can cut the gas to Europe and freeze us into surrendering. We're incapable of engaging Russia at this point without Russia being able to retaliate in greater force. The denazification means Putin wants to put Ukrainians in Eisenhower's death camps while Russia rebuilds the country into their own image. Very esoteric and suspicious activity in the east these days.
God bless the Ukrainian s an good luck.
Please Putine so be cool Stop war ...
I pray for peace 🙏🙏🙏...this is sad
“peace keeping”

We are coming for you putts pooton
https://youtu.be/CvdSURbmTig🇺🇦😢😢
Fuck Russia
Good and brave reporting, using subway stations as bomb shelters is like London during WW2. Putski  is going to have pretty crowded jails, filled with protesters. When Russian soldiers star coming home in body bags. Things will get worse for him. There was a run on Russian banks today, people trying to withdraw as much as possible.
I'd like to apologize of all my heart to the Ukrainian people I am sorry but we have a weak piece of shit president if we still had a man in charge this wouldn't happen
Madness ignorance and patriarchal mindset without heart
https://youtu.be/hybh45hNvxYStop the war in Ukraine 🇺🇦❤️.
It is not everywhere... just some military targets, if Russia wants to kill civilians, it would not be only 100+ death reported.
This is a very sad day......Putin should be held accountable
Putin, after having committed a Crimeanicide, is now carrying out a Ukrainicide , and remembers so much a German dictator with the mania of ethnic cleansing and invasions. All my affection and my solidarity to the Ukrainian sisters and brothers. Heaven would like to cry, but no more tears.
if u haven't looked into the nazi's putin is referring to, i suggest u do ur homework.
Sanction to be put permanently to bring Russia to a third world country where a dog would not live...
💔🤬 no words
Common bully Putin, give some nuke to that Ukraine, if you think you're powerful.
THEY DIDN'T HAVE A MEDIA VOICE AND IT WAS A PENTAGON MASSACRE* United States. IRAQ, SYRIA, LIBYA, AFGHANISTAN. YUGOSLAVIA.YEMEN. KUWAIT. JAPAN. AND the next year who will be., MALVINAS ALL BOMBED BY THEIR BOSS. AND HIS GROUP OF MAFIOSOS.
Sscen al kabal esta escpndido
When US enters the war, thats it. Ya'll better dig down deep for nuke fallout.
Putin is the new Hitler. They are killing innocent civilians.
And yet biden thinks sanctions will work
Only 
I thought NATO was paid a lot of money by Kyiv to have a military that could not be attacked by Russia at all, let alone what appears to be mostly unopposed.
i hope Putin stay with out food 2 weeks after his family one by one be cooking and have full stomac after!!
SO SAD  INNOCENT PEOPLE BEING FOUL PLAYED BY THEIR LEADERS AND MEDIA WORKERS OF SATAN
Honestly what is Russia's problem like leave Ukraine alone they did nothing Russia always causing trouble silly people🙄
What the fuck is the billions of dollars of military budget for other than this shit right here? We gotta get in there and stop Russia NOW
this is self defense for putin, huh? so by his exact logic, now ukraine can invade russia and kill its innocent people too. since when has ukraine interfered with russia, their government, military, their people? do the math on it, russia vastly outnumbers and outpowers them. this is not even a close match-up with the two isolated from outside factors, how could ukraine start this? putin needs to be reprimanded in front of a war tribunal and executed. his actions today alone have taken dozens, if not hundreds, of lives. fighting has broken out everywhere in ukraine, ukrainians are getting caught in the middle of useless war. FUCK PUTIN
Communist is real
Guys I have to ask my mom before we invade Ukraine idk if she’ll say yes
I am sorry what Crimeancide? Living in Crimea the only bad thing that happened to us is Ukraine shutting down electricity and cutting of water supply. Well and hypocricy of USA calling crimea an ukrainian region but at same time applying sanctions against crimean people.
 @Анатолий К.  I've a dear friend who was born and raised in the Crimea, and she had to flee her homeland and family and roots, and take refuge in a country where democracy reigns.Putin is on the wrong side of history.
The Ukraine is and was not a member of NATO so: (1) why would NATO guarantee military assistance, (2) why would the Ukraine pay for something when they aren't a member?
Listen at 8:21
It might be a big f.t lie and main stream medias force this script down to our heads so they can validate their main global goal
My heart is sad today de all Africa is sad fr dis my all country Zambia is sad abt dis war we are in prayers fr dis to stop sooner God is with u all
What is the purpose of all this I never got the point of bombing someone contry it make me sick..
Is this really happening
I thought the ukrainians have anti rocket rockets?
If you won't fight for your own country then you don't deserve it.Ukraine should learn from their history the USSR and Stalin.Tell your Ukrainian Men to grow some balls.
Fuck of nato usa 🤏🥚🇺🇸
Good lord be with the people 🙏. People stop running and get in the fight
fuck u russia
How long til they start heading for Washington DC???? Wonder how those ANTI GUN ACTIVISTS WOULD FEEL THEN
get ready america ,bidens involving us.
Holy sheat from UK
One side mentions a de-nazification and the other side mentions Nazi occupation, what the hell is going on here?
🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺❤❤❤❤❤💪💪💪💪💪👍👍👍👍👍
shame yourself rusia
It's not because of the Ukraine that the Russian s have attacked but only because of NATO' s foolishness that made the Russian' s have attacked. The European media house is a hypocrite just like the PM of Britain.
Stop war
Why does NATO not Offer a Trial membership to NATO for Ukraine and show Putin and the Ukraine how NATO works for each of its Members
Faaak jukrain
MH 17.THE GOD PAYBACK IN CASH.
putin is killing the innocent
Umm those were Russian jets.
This is crazy
The world is paying the price for democrats bull shit
It's only good when the West is bombing cities (Iraq etc)  Gfy
Disgusting!! What a big bully!
It's interesting how the media are not talking about the attacks of the Ukrainian army on the regions that declared independence. Most importantly, USA and NATO are reaching their first level goal of causing the reaction of Russian to attack Russia. Why cannot they respect human to life by just seat down, discuss and respect all their agreements for the sake of peace? Of course, peace is not as much profitable as as in time of war.
Why would they attack innocent people? They have nothing to do with this.
1:20 
I m crying
It’s already hard enough with Covid-19, why must they start another problem?  I’m sorry to all the civilians that are having to face this  🙏🏽
is it legal to target and kill civilians? Is this bosnia???
God please do something! Now!
😥Praying for Ukraine🙏🙏🙏
My best advice to Ukraine would be to lay down their arms and accept their fate. Fighting now will only increase civilian deaths. NATO nor the US will be sending any troops to help them and they are surrounded on all sides and outnumbered by Russia.
BBC is a joke honestly
Damn he said take out Nazis
Where did you read that, Wikipedia?
great observation comrade 🤝🤝
How can you even make that comparison? Is absurd.
All caused by joe Biden and democrats messing with other countries it’s really disgusting
My endless support for people of Ukraine !
Be a comedian again!
The reason why aliens don't talk to us
Putin is turning my country into a global outcast. Putin is killing Ukrainians. I am ashamed of my country. Putin burn in hell!!!
Self defense?? Ukraine never attacked Russia in the first place how is that self defense??? It seems more like paranoia of an attack that anything else, but Ukraine is less powerful than Russia why would they attack a country they knew they have chance of winning with? Because they didn't attack in the first place it's all a force narrative being created to justify their attack, after Ukraine then who's next?
You don't die for your country, you make the other guy die for his country.
Russia STOP. Like fr Russia STOP ITT
Why are we calling Kyiv, 'Keev'?
Marriages with the USA always end like this.
Ukraine fuck u I go Ukraine OT then bomb u instead with my fellow Russian brothers who I sold my soul to yesss Russia my brothers
The kabbahlist international bankers planned this a hundred years ago. You think it all beginning on 2-22-2022 on a 2'sDay is just a strange coincidence? These people under the power and prince of the air do EVERYTHING by the numbers. You should research how many 11's there were with the 9-11 
Lest we forget. It looks like Putin has forgotten.
remember how vietnam,iraq and afghanistan were the 
It’s time to free the Russian people from there Autocratic Rulers
Nazis have been attacking civilians in Lugansk and Donetsk, Zelensky did nothing to stop them, now this is the Russian retaliation. Fair? No!There are civilians in both sides.War is the defeat of humanity
you are afraid to retell Putin correctly and put his speech on paper with the CORRECT translation.it was convenient for you not to notice how in Ukraine for 8 years the Ukrainian army killed its inhabitants in the Donbass.And of course, no one knows that Zelensky PROMISED before the elections that he would give peace to the Donbass. Residents of eastern Ukraine voted for him, believing in his promises, but he turned their lives into hell on earth.Western Ukrainians did not want him for the presidency, because they knew that a clown would never make a head of state. But no one expected that the clown is also a puppet.
Blame biden if he left your country alone this would not have happend
If Biden wasent trying to make them a member of the UN this would not happen plus ucraine had nukes democrats removed them and said they would protect them but democrats never live up to there word there only concern is them selfs and how much money they can launder out of ucraine now you got this well good luck they pushed Putin and he does not fuck around
How much where you paid?
The sneering Putin, that's a fearsome sight of a hideous dictator.
Hmmm? Strange how this is kicking off after Co.vid.
He accused ukranians as nazi’s ??? How???
I want to see,end of Putin carrier .I hope so .He is one evil Man .This is something,what for sure, people of Russia not need..at all !And,I’m sure,most of Russians ,not support this  crime !F..k that Putin !
Western fake propaganda news. No civilian houses were targeted. This is footage from 2014 of some ukrainians hit in Donetsk.
Dialog are best for everyone may god Peace ✌️ both county's
Putin was lieing the whole time no body will ever take whatever  he says as the truth
Putin’s invasion will accomplish nothing good for him and Russia. Instead, this invasion will make Putin the most hated man in the world. Perhaps that is what he wants.
The Ukrainian president is just as bad as Putin. He got to power by screwing with elections like Putin does to keep power. It’s sad the people need to suffer from two maniacs.
Y'all remember saying 2020 is the worst year? 🥴🥴
I pray for the safety of all Ukrainian people, lots of love from Pakistan 🇵🇰
So US was right about the invasion.
Haha.Russians aren't attacking any civilians you f. idiots
War crimes. Someone needs to kill Hitler.
I pray God himself to stop this war .I feel pain to the community . please my lord answer my prayer
I see so many people praying for Ukrainian people. I'm just not sure: are you praying for the people from Donbass or for the western Ukranian people, who have been bombing Donbass for 8 years? Just curious...for 8 years civilians from Donbass have been dying and nobody cared.
Shame on such reporting. Just portraying putin as some maniac diactator while totally hiding the role of USA and Europe in this who have been fueling this war all along
Politicians war. This could have been avoided if the politicians didn't align themselves with NATO. They knew very well that intimidation and provocation by NATO will start war. Stupid Ukrainian government. Well wishes to the innocent citizens.
Everyone is falling for the propaganda hook line and sinker. Where's the live footage of these targets getting hit? All we see is aftermath images and footage. Where's the dead bodies? Where's the footage from the ordinary civilians? Let me guess, the Internet is down over there...
This is a war, not a dating party until Putin is looking for love
 @زهراء الزهراء  Not sure of what you mean. Your comment makes no sense to me.
Ukrainian gov has been a puppet of usa ever since the coup in 2014
 @Анатолий К.   I believe so. Puppet Politicians are laughing to the banks with American incentive aids and support while their people feel the consequences. They should have remained nuetral or invited economic relations with EU and co.

Putin lion
Is something BIG coming up????
BBC has to stop interviewing Russian citizens, they’re going to get innocent people arrested just so they have a sound bite. Guarantee everyone you saw in the video from Russia will be arrested and possibly killed by the state.
Just one word of NATO that Ukraine will not join NATO stoped Putin much earlier but NO they said our NATO doors are always opened...where are those doors??? USA framed Ukraine very good friend)
The fear now… is the west is all talk
Iblame Biden .  Thank God I'm Trump is not in office cause they would have blamed him .This is what the democrats the media , Hollywood , news , net works , the view , Rosie O'Donnell , mexico , England , Canada , the pope .Where are all of Biden supporters .Take that democrats .
Media are going into a frenzy with this to get everyone to go against Russia cmon people wake the fuck up.
Fire ball?
for mother russia!!! ukrainians, give up and your loans and mortgages will be erased like in crimea!!rза Родину!!! Украинцы, сдавайтесь, и ваши кредиты и ипотека будут обнулены как в Крыму!!
a corrupted savage nation invades another savage corrupted one. I bet Ukrainians will surrender as easily as the afghans. If the Westerners did not step into this savagery many lives would have been spared (Ukrainians did not resist the last Russian invasion, and they aren't different, if they could they would invade Russia). My point is just: war is stupid and terrible, Russia is an uncivilized nation, but that doesn't make Ukraine better.
Do y'all know that something more horrible than this has been going on in Western Cameroon (Ambazonia) as well as South Eastern Nigeria (Biafra) for over 5 years now yet the world media turned a blind eye.Hypocrisy!!!!
At this point the mentally ill Putin who was trained by KGB and have only blood in his mind he must never ever talk about GOD again because he is evil for this world right now. This man is Hitler of our time ! Even most of the  russian citizens don't want war  only the mentally ill as Putin want war on this time.
Ahhhh, seems like only days ago these forums were full of people saying how the West was all but making these tensions up and being hysterical eyc etc.They've suddenly shut up.....
This is horrible bless all the people in danger
It is very scary but I hope everyone the best luck. I hope everyone in the buildings good luck. There were lots of people dying that didn’t to anything. I wish you good luck and hope people in Ukraine are okay.
Can’t say we didn’t see it coming.  Very strategic timing from Putin.   Attack once America has a weak leader and weak energy sector.
Prayed for Afghanistan, prayed for Syria.. there is no GOD , only the world leaders are acting like god.. and now Ukraine.. if there was God world would have been a better place.. you stupid fools ! Lets see how far your Prayers work
only difference is that in Russia you are dragged to jail immediately  and disappear
 @john Van Asten   Still, the line of distinction is too thin.
Thats how manipulated media works. Only what can bring benefit to the higher ups is being shown. No one truly cares about peace, only interests.
Look at Putin’s 1988 phone collection. He must be fierce when on a distorted speakerphone.
Bye bye to Putin and any support he thought he had. He miscalculated how people would perceive this action.
We aren't going to do shit this is obvious to China and Russia ..
They poked the bear. Now they will pay. God bless Russia
#teamRussia #teamPutin
This is not in self defense. This is war.
Where's the NATO in all this????? They are the ones who provoked Russia by their Eastern expansion, and now they are quiet??????
Give up your nukes you don’t need them
America, this is your time to shine💁🏽‍♂️
Putin is the best. You will understand soon ❤️❤️❤️
This is what happens when a German passes of Russia by closing the gas pipe.
This wouldn't of happened with a tougher president
They should have joined NATO
Ukraine will surrender quickly....
Putin is a goddamned MURDERER and he needs to pay. How DARE he attack innocent people without provocation like this. Any decent nation should stand by Ukraine.Not only has he dragged a country to war for no good reason, but he’s dragging ALL of us from Europe and the U.K. in too. We only just came through pandemic ffs, we don’t need this shit. Find Putin, and string him up. Warmongering is not welcome in this world.
I'm really afraid that there will be a world war. And a nuclear one too
Y’all deal with that stop trying to act like this is going to lead to world war lll
Where’s the United Nations when you need them
Wow, we did not hear this when the United States invaded Afghanistan. We did not hear it when Britain and America also invaded Iraq. We did not hear when Israel invaded Palestine and killed a people... I hope that the Ukrainians will not be harmed, but let the world know that America and its allies are just nonsense defending their interests only, but even that their interests  They are unable to defend it, they are only fighting weak countries
 @زهراء الزهراء  I don’t run this country. If I did you’d hear this a lot more. We can’t help what our leaders do. Like Iraq, I was dead against war then, but the people around me weren’t, and war happened anyway. War is NOT the answer, and just because bad things have happened in the last, doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try to stop them this time. And don’t confuse compassion with weakness. Diplomacy is a strength too you know.
All your thoughts are prayers mean shit btw. These people need actual help.
It must be so frightening ! My heart goes out to Ukraine and their people 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
No one should be surprised… Putin hasn’t changed one bit since he’s been in power, he should of never been able to have so much power and free control
He won’t stop at Ukraine
This is not how a democracy country resolve. My prayers to families of Ukraine😓😢😭
Putin is a Liar and a Little man.
Praying for Peace. Praying for Ukrainians and Russians. Seems that this could have been prevented. But the War drums were being beat by same shadow groups behind the scenes of the coup d'etat in Ukraine 2014 of their democratically-elected President. (It's not simply Ukraine vs Russia). We will all suffer if this War isn't stopped! Join thousands globally praying tonight for Peace in Europe.🙏
shit..why do this Russia??
So what happened to hitting just military targets!
And America can't do shit about it.
The Russian are sick of the bullshit the democrats in the usa want war they are feeding the people bullshit The usa has ist owns problems this is not world war lll
So okay for the US, UK & NATO to attack & bomb Serbia back in the late 90s, then start the illegal war in Iraq, then the attack & occupation  of Syria, Libya, Afghanistan by the US, UK NATO, Russia do the same to protect their borders & the world condemnation blames Russia, the west are a bunch of Hippocrates, Russia has done the exact same as NATO in recognising Doneztz & Luthansk  as indépendant states, they do not want to annex them, just give them their freedom from a potentially genocidal situation  committed by Ukraine, long live Russia  !
US and UK are so good in propaganda...
Awful, just absolutely awful. Putin must be stopped now
If Ukraine was in NATO Russia would be destroyed by now
America invades iraqThe world : meh Russia invades UkraineThe world : WW3
Looks like California fiers
No one’s comment gonna help the people of Ukraine, therefore please just watch and don’t fkn comment , people don’t need your pity words they need physical help.. fkn they should’ve bombed the kremlin where putin is hiding
Wtf u talking about, how does ukraine even think of committin a genocide. Russia is using east ukraine origin and indépendance as an excuse to expand to crimea and out of fear from NATO  only.
 @GRIZIUS  yeah, okay, you just get back to watching the BBC, the company that shielded J.Saville & his mates for over 40 years from prosecution for paedophillia , thats obviously where your loyalties lay instead of the truth !
The whole worlds trying to rebuild itself, and these dogs only seek to destroy.
This happened to my country Croatia when Serbia invaded us, Ukraine was one of the first  to accept us a Country...Very sorry that this is happening, I wish they stay strong and I wish to tell them that they are a resilient people and will get through this.
Remember Yugoslavia, Iraq, Syria, Afgan!
Putin has a communist mentality, and this will never change. He will always be a dictator.
Other countries should stop listening to US advice
Sanctions? NOT THE UNITED STATES, THE UK, FRANCE, GERMANY, NO ONE IS GOING TO DO ANYTHING TO RUSSIA! And you people with your, “diplomaticrapproach!”  “Let’s talk it out!” Doesn’t work against a bully! THE BULLY ONLY UNDERSTANDS FORCE! Sanctions, what a JOKE!  (A good worrier never starts a fight but herprepares for one and hope it never comes!)
Putin and Russia have my full support. Much love from Texas. Take down all Ukrainian Neo Nazis.   By punishing Russia we're punishing ourselves global collapse incoming
I hope this is a limited conflict but the Ukrainian will fight on. A very disturbing situation.
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷
I can't recall this many comments combined when anglos were bombingIraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Lybia, Yugoslavia,Yemen and so on.Hypocrat governments and Hypocrat population
PUTIN …. Totally lost his mind… just an idiot human… so sad…why
IT'S TIME FOR THE UNITED STATES to face the aggressive action of Russia.
#Nowar
bbc.....ah alot of old video.....
Jesus won't save Ukrainians, only action
Looks like ole glad of mear is reilly gettin it on baby's.
Well, Ukraines ex comedian of a President is not barking threats at Russia now. What an Idiot
But what about the covid crisis
The stupidity of the Ukrainian president is the main raison of this war... he thought Europe and USA will fight with his country against Russia, he was so stupid to believe that
Rusi su sad ko što su naše 
Croatia was in Civil War, I don't know about what 
 @Blaide  people ignorant as you amaze me , thinking you know more than a person who has lived through the war, how self intitled are you?
It’s time for the United States to but the fuck out of the mess they started (as with every war shitty america is involved in)
Omg! Please God protect all of those innocent people there. This is so bad and so not right
If nato is so United go in there all together and help them!
imagine this putin boi was takin his time and now ukraine wanna join nato and he mad. wat an immature brat he is
I don't know what will happens if Russia and China Put missiles at mexico, Cuba, Canada, Pasific Us Border and Atrantic Us Border
Xenophobia country south African
Almost 1 million uprooted from their home, families with children sleeping in the metro
The world is at war! This is real, ladies and Gentlemen! Glory to God!
Praying for ukrain 🙏 stop  doing waarr rusha putin shyam on you
Fuck you people for south African racisme xenophobia country south African
The World now knows Putin is a liar, if his people support him they are no better.
Yah this may lead to 3rd world war
I'm an Australian and I cry for the people of Russia and Ukraine. So many good, and honest people are going to die... and for what?I also cry because I never imagined that I could see WW3 in my lifetime. If NATO intervenes it will become a world war. If NATO does not intervene Ukraine suffers and loses everything the people have fought for.I think the only hope of de-escalation at this point, is if the Russian people overthrow Putin. He clearly doesn't care about the welfare of his people, and the children who could lose their parents
Whispering at 8:21. Secret message?
I hope that there is no nuclear warfare
All after saying he wasn't going to attack. He's a grimey one, that Putin. This could almost definitely be the beginning on WWIII
The poor citizens of Ukraine. Scary and heartbreaking.
I wish filipinos in rusia or Ukraine  well be safe
this is the result of dealing with the USA 😒 WHY is the Ukraine president calling the USA? it's part of the Europe! I guess Russia is in the right to do so, fearing a USA military bass near them if they joined the nato, putin alerted them, I'm sorry for the civilians but it's the Ukraine politics that led to this if they just stayed neutral and didn't demand to join the nato. and what about Palestine? what about Burma? what about Iraq? what about Afghanistan?
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChxOwPMNOFR9w2Yjz6kXAkg
Interesting. Both girls at the end of the interview look like have major problems.
Believe me, not all support him, and most people in Russia are in shock! There were anti-war protests today and 600 arrested so far..
It's like Hitler's lies before he invaded Poland and starting WW2. It's so sad
Long live Putin
How? He said he's fighting Nazis. That's what y'all wanted. You can do anything now. Just say that.
Ms.Twisted Sister i have no doubt in my mind this the beginning of World War
 @Zyme !  How did Hitler lie? He said he wanted German people's and lands back. The Danzig corridor was part of Germany. Chamberlain and Western media lied and said he would stop. The West knew that Germany and Russia were going to divided Poland up in 1938.
It’s a military airport FFS BBC
Thank you for voting Biden ... now we have to deal with this crap 😒
Putin is a modern day Hitler who doesn't allow freedom of speech..... God bless Ukraine 🇺🇦
🇩🇪🇷🇺🇺🇦
Finally Corona virus has been  replaced in our headlines with Russia vs Ukraine.Wth this people were distributing Covid-19 vaccines for? They were producing vaccines and producing weapons of mass destruction at the same time. I think One of the biggest threat to humanity is a politician!
I want to know how killing civilians is necessary. They are innocent human beings. This is a grave injustice!
What the hell does he mean by de-nazify Putin is the one who's being aggressive. Correct me if I'm wrong but Ukraine has not done anything wrong and Putin is acting in 
This is so sad that one person has to control by doing this when we should all live happy how can people sleep at night when even children loose their lives. So sad
Great,now we can charge you 5 dollars for a gallon of gas
Fear for his job?! 😂🤣 that's the least in his mind at this moment! Support for Russia defeat those Nazis!
Putin is acting like  Dictatorship!
Putin is a liar just like his buddy trump...
Slava Ukraini! Heroiam slava!
Russia should go find some females to go fk n stop this war look at what's going on already in the world
Stay safe all Ukrainians 🇺🇦 Watch out for Russian bots in the comments. I see a few potential ones already.
Can we have just 1 normal year?!Remembering Ukraine in Prayers!
За Донбасс и Луганск!!!
WW3 is inevitable that why west is acting like deaf and blind that is why they are always  looking for one to blame (Russia)
Germany still supply Russia with money from Nord Stream and SWIFT.
This is so unnecessary. Can't we just grow up and be kind to one another?
Hell yea, about times the game begin.
Prayers to you Ukraine.I feel so sad, angry and helpless.
I don’t like the way this going . I believe this could turn to a world war
Go fight for your country!!!! Stop running no one can do it .. but you!!
America and Neto is fully responsible for this attack
Exactly what Biden wants
And Putin sits comfortably and safely on his fat arse behind the Kremlin walls...
So Ukraine was part of Russia once? And now are independent? Was this independence given with the conditions over never joining the EU or nato? Just trying to understand what is going on. In understand Russia fear of having nato missles right on their border. Yanks would never allow Russian missiles on theirs. I know putin is sound and isn't a maniac, so can someone try explain to me what is going on? It's obviously money driven again as always but I can't connect the dots.
Prayers to Ukrainians 🙏 🇺🇦❤❤🇲🇽
PUTIN WANTS UKRAINE  ...SO BLOW UP AND DESTROY  IT FIRST  ....WHAT A IDIOT  AND ULTIMATE STUPIDITY
I hope that world ban him from the world and that Country gos down what they did
One can't help oneself thinking, if Ukrain didn't side with Nato and the west in general, what are/were they hiding? Hidden agenda's etc. I don't think the Russians are doing this just because... it's just. Two sides to the coin and also, this has been going on for quite some time already.
As Russia to Ukraine, China to Taiwan
Let's not forget that Russia has enormous stores of nuclear weapons.  So do we.  Just one mishandling, one mistake can wipe out every organic being, plant, animal & human.  We have to figure out how toprevent this.  It is not Ukraine's problem or Russia's.  It is our problem.  All of ours.  This is much worse than the Cuban Missle Crisis.
UKRAINE FOR THE WIN!!!!🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏...fly high to the people who has lost lives or people in there family or people they know🕊🕊
Shocking.
Inside job
Putler go to hell
https://youtu.be/L0G9WRRWIuM<
My sister is in Ukraine. This is how I feel
Come to Ukraine and fight on our side, only this way we will feel your support 😔
When you say your angry I see the media has gotten to you!
No, Ukraine wasn't part of Russia, (Crymia was until 1954 but was gifted
too bad they don't have rocket launchers just firing at each tank as it enters their country. smh.
putin will pay huge for this, that it will be an example to all.
F*ck Russia. I stand with Ukraine.
You have to stop doing it!!!! It’s innocent people hurt, military people are sick. Какая нахрен защита? Кто трогал Донбасс- он хочет ее поглотить … всю Украину и Белоруссию,И воссоздаст ссср
This shows that Russian is powerful enough because even western are scared to intervene
Pakistan ka support karoge to yehi hoga Ukrain
No one wants another Soviet occupation.
God Give them courage and Guidance to make things good for the sake of Humanity🙏
Dosnt look like its been attacked to me
Can't believe it's happening it must be hard for the people bless them.
Kind of pathetic that the BBC has only reported on this for the last 2 weeks only, a shame you thought reporting around the clock on Number 10 parties was more important; you should consider what's happening in China as-well now you caught up.
Putun day us coming...what goes around .....💥
And all of that for what? Ukraine  doesn't matter, it's all about US and Russia  showing  off .
Putin is a modern day Hitler. A liar and a war-monger, and most of us know how Hitler's efforts ended up.This looks awfully like the beginning of WW3.No wonder ordinary Russians don't support Putin.They know how Germany ended up in WW11.
Putin you rat. Justice will get you.
This is so sad!
Stay calm not like said presenters. Remember has  men think of so shall they be so don't by the right wing attack on you in this devisive presentation we do not need the worry any more of the folk they dealt with to mutch it's not a worry for me but I may worry if I allow my self I to be persuaded by yous gossips were not rushing were british 🙂
WHERE IS YOUR FIGHTING JET EUKRAIN..?? REPLY NOW...
I know somebody is going to cry about why I’m even making the comparison but Idc, it is infuriating to be hit in the face without how little Palestinian life is valued, Israel wiped out entire families in Gaza multiple times and nothing even close to this reaction
Moron
Welcome to the reality of manipulated media. If you are on a wrong side your voice wont be heard.And given how similar the majority of comments here is i tend to think bots are involved in this too
This makes me so sad 😞 😢
So this is what it’s like to live through a World War…
NOBODY LIKES WAR .MY HEART IS OUT TO ALL THE CITIZENS WHO ARE HURT AND INJURED MAY YOU REST IN PEACE.
Where have you been during last 8 years when Ucranian government was doing genocide on it's own land against people in Donbass !??
No more love 💔 in the humans left 💔
Barbaric
Stand and fight Ukraine!! Civilians pick up arms to defend your country, do not let another country take your God given liberty.
It breaks me to know that ukraine had to call upon the personal military reserve. Every abled-bodied man aged 18-60 years old now stand to defend their country. Seems surreal because, had this been in my country, I would be fighting right now..... I cannot believe this is happening  :o
Criminal !!!
please when translating the speech please put up subtitles and don't overlap a segment of a speech so those who do understand the language can comprehend what was misinterpreted. US took over the UN a long time ago we all know it. And anti-propaganda campaign over the last 50 years had reached its bottom line.I hope that it will not be a repeat of the culture purge that happened before ww2.
My anxiety is through the roof 📈📈
Good to see they're showing some of the Russian public disvowing it. It's expected but people can get very riled up and forget. Countries aren't inherently bad, but there are bad goverments. Taboo subject but a lot of nazis deserted, defected, refused orders, tried to help people too. Heard of some Russian soldiers surrendering today. They didn't think they were going there to kill people. Well we know that's nonsense but the main thing is that they stood down.
why to show there faces .... risk them for nothing
dont forget china is with russia  its all been a planned does not happen by chance and old joe gave russia the oil this is outa hand
I don't understand the Russia Ucrane situation ,  one thing I heard is that Ucrane has Nuclear reacters to make electricity , and all Putin needs to do is to order their bomming and the rest will be history.
Cmon why does this have to happen? Why can't the whole world just be in peace and stop starting wars?
The beginning of WW3 folks…
POO tin
The fate of every single person on this planet  is decided by one man, how does that work?
Time to stock up on tissues, because there will be more horror to come😥
 @Mizer Mustard  yes :( its so sad.  The whole world is going bad :(
 @Mizer Mustard  i knownits been like this, but i feel it gets worse and worse. And yes, not only crying but praying too. I know things are going to happen anyway, its just so sad to see all this happening.
 @Presly Tanus  Yes, it is indeed getting worse and worse all over the world at every minute, and this is why I have already lost hope for this world a long time ago. For this reason I wear a big protective emotional shield over my heart, mind y soul. All we can do to survive this chaotic world of evil, is to do our best in each moment. Rezo por el mundo…como siempre🙏
https://youtu.be/L0G9WRRWIuM.
They're horribly outnumbered personnel wise by the Russians, even after calling up their reserves. NATO should step up and help with personnel. Putin and the Russians must be stopped or it may not stop with the Ukraine.
No you wouldn't have, you would be the first person to be run off and evacuate, anyone can be a keyboard warrior.
I see many able body running away instead of defending their country.
 @Rafael Torres  They don’t want to die. Don’t blame them.
 @Leon   I wouldn't be allowed to run. That's the point of the personal reserve. You don't have a choice 👌
If there’s a WW3 you guys can fight with me and betray China :)
8:21 Someone is whispering in the audio.  Anyone able to isolatet/translate?
The US invaded over 30 countries since 1980 and selling their weapons everywhere.Just stay on your own continent and manage your own problems (you have enough of them)The complete US economy is war based.
Yes mate, taking out the deep state X
love her logic,war is bad so just surrender.as a Finn my heart is with Ukraine,stay strong
Biden better shut the fuck up and stay out of it, Putin attacked to prove he’s not afraid of week-ass Biden, it’s not our business and our children are going to die because of our week-ass government and woke-ass military
Wtf self defence Putin is talking about? My prayer goes out to the people of Ukraine, 🙏 so the world is gonna sit and watch Putin kill innocent Ukrainian including women and children?
The father with his young son got me, as parents you fiercely protect your children , being left with little options and being powerless is terrible. I hope this gets sorted out quickly.
Attack on US insurgents and US Nazi criminals, god bless Russia stay strong God Bless President Putin ❤👌
This is so sad and heart breaking these people have kids, oh my God put a hand
Fake news
This war created by Boris Johnson and Biden given fake promises to ukraine president.  Ukraine president thought NATO , UK , US will help , however he made a blunder by provoking russia by this fake promise
Other than freezing Bank accounts who have hid there bulk wealth what is anyone actually doing,Unless USA does anything nobody will fact.....
Did anyone notice the sequence of the Russian correspondent opening statement? I bet he fears for his life despite being incognito
Prayers for Ukraine from Slovakia. 🇺🇦🇸🇰
Fake news
putin is funny, he's telling the people not to worry thats he's just destroying their military defenses..... duh... that's why theyre worried..  😂
The US and NATO have been massacring Afghans in Afghanistan for 20 years and Iraq has been destroyed in the name of chemical weapons.  Destroyed in order to bring the government of their choice in Syria and Libya ...  Will the US and NATO admit their crimes against humanity?
RICH GRAB MONEY FROM MUNITION
This makes me so scared for the future.
By God I know God will do justice.
I hope so man, I know I’m far away from all of it but I feel for the people over there. We all take for granted just simply coming home to relax after a long day, among other things.
Condolence to our Ukrainian brothers & sisters from Bangladesh. .. Civilians are paying the price for the incompetent leadership of Ukraine . .. seems like Ukrainian leaders chose to be on the wrong side of the game. .. if a cat think it's become tiger just because a wolf is provoking it is to be that the cat would definitely be mauled by the real annoyed tiger sooner or later. .. stay strong my Ukrainians brothers & sisters your corrupt government is totally responsible for this mess & misery.
THATS WHERE I LOST IT TOO!!! I feel so bad for them and I'm praying to God that he will somehow make it all stop over there!!!  I know God can do anything!!!! May he protect all those innocent people and be with them!!!  May he keep his hands on them all!!! 🙏🙏🙏😘❤️💞💕
 @Cindy  Yeah seeing that and imagining being in that position… very sad . Can physically see the worry on that fathers face .
It will only get worse. You can thank Spoon-fed-Biden and US demoncRATS
 @Hi Hi  oh how easy life would be if that were true
Out of question, what do democrats and Biden have to do with this? I’m genuinely curious
 @eee Itisme  everything.  Instead of trying to come to an understanding they're pushing the US into war with Russia . Biden can't even answer a question from the press without his handlers kicking them out .
 @eee Itisme  he's even going as far as using 30 million tax dollars to distribute crack pipes to crack feigns like his son during hard times like these. Anyone who voted for him is a living joke.
How about they leave the country with any means necessary like getting in a boat or something.
No matter what I'm stickin'with TOYOTA Cars 💯-Scotty Kilmer
NATO should NUKE russia before its too late, this is just the start of world domination
 @Akhandd Bangladesh  in what way is Ukraine responsible for this? It's either Russia or the US.
 @Hairy Rokeke  no
 @entertainment 4fun  They most likely didn't have a boat to flee in. Russia is attacking from all sides of the country, so they're probably afraid to even go outside on the streets.
 @Michael Vargas  You sound like a particularly stupid person.
 @Michael Vargas  
That father should enlist with the Ukrainian military right away and fight to defend the country for his son.
 @Akhandd Bangladesh  shut up troll
 @Pete Davis  you obviously don't have half a brain to even look up anything I said so you're dumbass is so quick to be in denial. Sad your liberal mother didn't abort you.
 @Hi Hi  the time they launch the nuke.. your god is no more 🙏
I cried when I saw that. Those poor people
I wonder if he fought when obama overthrew the ukranian gov in 2014, set up chocolate king poroshenko as leader.  Then plundered the wealth and installed pelosi, biden, schiff, schummer, etc sons/daughters as heads of ukranian corporations laundering drug money.  Putins kicking them out.
​ @I'm sorry, its immaturity  Never think god is not aware of the transgressor he only wait until there eye will stare into horror.Head gushing up, Heart hollow (because of fear and etc) Every soul will earn what it earned none will be wronged not even an atom weight.
I hope so to✌️
Zelensky is too naive and are barking at the wrong door. Be like Afghans, they defeated Russia, the US, and NATO.
Sitting looking at my young son now and thinking there isn't anything I wouldn't do to protect him, the free world needs to get together and annihilate this threat.
 @SCPython  Ukranians saw their gov overthrown, foreign rulers issuing orders for them to kill fellow Ukranians in the east.  Pretty sure they won't take up arms.
He means that they should not worry because the people will be under the protection of Russia
Because they only want their own interest, there is wisdom (a common proverb) that states: The father is able to hit the mother only because she is often weak... This applies to America and its allies, as it is only able to defeat the weak state, but the big one knows that their end is at her hand
Respect for Mark, ready to sacrifice and protect his country and its civilians
Fuck this guy has no heart he dint even think abt the kids
Just wait till its the usa under attack... By every country there is
Power and money corrupt most people. Putin has been in power for 18 years. The Russian people must kick him out of office. 💕 ☮ 🌎 🌌

Just let them be! Ukraine got their independence in 1991. It hasn't even passed 50 years!! Come on! Horrible Putin, terrible Russian government. This is so stupid!!!!
Does anyone remember the WMD. That destroyed Iraq.  All lies.  BLAIR AND BUSH ARE WARMONGERS MILLIONS OF PEOPLE INCLUDING CHILDREN ARE DEAD.  NO MENTION OF THE FAKE Weapons of mass destruction
Random pedestrians in Ukraine speak such clear English?
I can't imagine how happy the American politicians are.
Ukraine is Russia property not country.  West should stop playing games with Ukraine people.
All these people asking where is nato to help them while they just sit there.  Grab a gun, help yourself.
This video is a sales pitch for war
NATO played a dangerous game for decades. This was inevitable. Putin has been way too patient in my opinion.
God please help them please
I hope our cock head president sends missiles at Russia to protect Ukraine...He started this.
Russia is puttin a lot of tension that might escalate into something worse. Its not the war of the people but the war of the leaders and their egoes...
Ukraine should stop being a puppet for the US... They should be neutral and not align themselves with the West
use log lol
Yes, they occupied my country with false deceptions, and now they denounce Russia's occupation of Ukraine, even though Russia entered Ukraine according to the independence query that the Ukrainians voted on.
Yea
Moron
 @Alan B  The truth is bitter.  America provoked this invasion. Putin is bad but the US is far worse.
 @Jim Bocho  yawn 🥱
Using empty words to this idiot heading Russia is useless. Let there be military intervension from NATO and all nations accross the world including use of atomic bombs on these satan Putin!!
This is a pillow fight compared to uk an us invasion of Iraq
the west brought this on wanting ukraine to join nato.
Thank America this is their script, Putin is not a killer.
Will pay back to Russia...... Putin you are good men  anymore.......  YOU ARE BAD MEN.......
All Putin needs is not a war. He just needs a good psychiatrist. Once he finds a good one, he can him also to Xin Ping and Kim Jong Un too are badly in need of one.
This makes no sense. Bro you knew your country was going to be invaded yet your military wasn’t in standby? Hmmmmmm…. Something is off here.
This is so sad
Teroristt Turkey and Azrbejan 👌👌👌👌👌
Mother Russia 🇷🇺 will rule Europe 💪
Why do we continue to allow suits to control us

We are such a primitive species for doing this to each other.
Bullies need to be dealt with in such a way that they no longer can bully anyone.
Every said
The people should beat these politicians for all the stupid trouble around the world
yes this war is horrible but everyone needs to calm down and turn to God about this, This is only the beginning of the end and is explained In the bible where it talks about this invasion of Ukraine (Gomer) in Daniel 11:40-45 Where it talks about the Great King of the North(Russia) will try to invade several nations including Urkraine but will not succeed. After this is over you will see the Prophecy of Psalm 83 open where it that talks about The Great Bear of the North (Russia) moving to invade the Holy Land when the (Holy Lamb) Israel is at rest but when the Russians come to take over. The Great Bear will be pleaded with by the West but all they will do is talk. The Bear will not listen and move into Israel but God will move the Palestinians to stand with the Lamb and push the Bear to Siberia (Matthew 24:36 and Ezekiel 38:18-19) when God steps in and puts the Great Bear down once and for all and then the Great War or WW3 will take place in Revelations 16:14
You could tell by the negotiation talks that he was going to do it its really no shock 😑
The Russian government wants that.  The Russian people do not want people to be refugees.  The 366th Russian Regiment, which expelled, displaced and killed Azerbaijanis from Karabakh, still does not allow Ukrainians to live comfortably at home.  What do you want, Russian leaders?
No, we are sinners and that is why these type of things happen.
2020-2022 has been something else
Putin is a criminal
Putin would never have done this if Trump was our President
puk n wants this area but is going to blow it up  what a dumb fuck
guys trust me it´s really bad
NATO at russian border this is what u get...
Just when you thought the days of invading another country were over..
NATO should send troops to fight because next war we will have to fight either in Poland, Baltic States or Finland you are absolute naive if you believe Putin will stop with Ukraine, he will stop there where we will stop him
Trouble makers of thevworld
WTF IS PUTIN TRYING TO DO? DOES HE WANT A WAR? WHY WOULD HE WANT A WAR?
Love, Love, Love, Peace , Peace , Peace, on Earth!🙏🙏🙏🙏 Forevermore! 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Need to come to USA nd do the same remove these evil.nwo mf
Just dont kill people with this bullshit please. We just came out of a pandemic.
If the Russians hate Putin, why not just throw him out of office??
I'm from Turkey, I've known many Ukrainians, God forbid, civilians will not be harmed, I hope these armies are watching the war with concern from Turkey. My heart is with you.i know from history russia has a dream of invading eastern europe after ukraine and istanbul
Killing civilians you big fuckin hero.
Crooks shameless politicians
This is so wrong on all sides period these people do not deserve this
Not nice in 2022people are educated but behaving lik crooks of the olden days times
the most sad war.
It will never be over. Never.
Don't be naive. Those days never ended and never will.
I don't understand why he would target the people though? How can that be advantageous?
As long as evil prevail war is always near
Bro wasn't the U.S in the middle east not to long ago
You can set your calendar to war breaking out in this region of the world. It's been this way for 1700 years.
What made you think it was over?
Putin was sad he couldn't defeat the Mid easterners so now he is going for even weaker enemies.

Breh do you live in a box?? Russia has been in and out of Ukraine and surrounding territories since the early 1990s
We just invaded Iraq in 2003, just left Afghanistan last year. America is always at war or invading somewhere.
People just dont change at all.. this killings and fighting for power has been going on for decades smh. Only a big a** asteriod will end all of this human conflicts.
What about Serbia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria ...?
Never underestimate your opponent . Hitler was not the only nut thiers hundreds of them . When one gets power it's sad. I don't think this will end it's just the beginning. I hope America is ready because I think it's the actual target . I think our military should be on alert to defend it planes should be loaded at ready . Putin more than likely will find justification. China sided with Russia I think we need to be tracking thier movement's as well I'm sure we or. I don't think world should buy any more products from them as well.
 @Home steading Tennessee river  America cannot be defeated in a conventional war. The only attack on America would have to be nuclear and if that happens we’re all cooked.
 @James DeMarr  from what ive heard russia are actually defending themselves, i arent certain because i dont follow any of this shit and if if russia is defending itself it definetly isnt going the right way about it
It only showed that it never stops , and that it is even faster now than back in the day
Quite the opposite.Scriptures say that things will progress from bad to worse. True peace will only be accomplished when Jesus returns. Until then, the intensity will only increase like the birth pangs of a woman. (Matthew 24:6-8)
 @old bloke stranded  its Russian invasion. Russia enters Ukraine. Because Putin is sad old man thinks Ukraine belongs to Russia His citizens dont agree with him.
 @J P  That is the problem with  humanity! Our own self destruction
 @Dark Rising  More like the first time a 1st world country invaded another 1st world country in a long time.
 @Dark Rising  they thought the 
 @manic hairdo  you are such a positive person
 @Fyn Kozari  fair enough I don't really know shit about it but Russia is definitely handling it completely wrong, I heard something about Ukraine building weapons or something on the border of Russia almost asking for a war but idk if its true, either way I agree putin is an idiot and he's taking it way too far
 @James DeMarr  why? Because Russia wants Ukraine   Their land to be Russia and people in Ukraine will stand and fight but they have no chance.  Some will run and some will stay to fight.  I hope someone stops it tho because when Russia wins. They will run the world for awhile then us will get tired of it then China and you know where Iam going with this.
 @Zeus  why we need or armed services out at sea lots of them. Don't put all yours eggs in one basket.
When has anyone ever thought that? You seem disconnected from the world based on this comment.
 @Unkn0wn22  I am not advocate of war and crime but go read the main cause of war thoroughly and you will see ego and hypocrisy from both NATO and Russian side
Clearly you don't know what china's been upto.
Do you mean, white countries invading white countries? Invasions haven’t stopped.
People of Iraq & Libya are saying the same thing.
 @James DeMarr  he isn't targeting people
 @MrDJCue  the bible says so many things that dont make sense and it has been used as a tool to gain power and manipulate people so i dont know as i trust it at all
And the invasion of communism and cancel culture
You mean invading white European countries? Western countries never stopped invading 3rd world, specifically black and brown countries. No one gave a sh!& when Biden bombed Syria two weeks after being in office.
You guys should always understand how propaganda works in almost any situations1) Sad music in the background ☝️2) Crying child so it adds more drama to the situation ☝️3) Scary intonation for more effect ☝️Basically, propaganda always works and hits through the emotions, not real factsSo, please, show more crying children during 8 years of the war on the Donbass as well, show people being burned alive in Odessa in 2014, show many Russians people in Ukraine being killed during last years in the 
 @old bloke stranded  a concept not making sense to you as an individual is a very subjective way of looking at things. A computer science syllabus makes no sense to a 6 year old.
 @MrDJCue  what christian denomination do you belong to btw
Lol you were asleep for the last 20 years when America invaded Iraq and Afghanistan?
Good thing you're not a president. Welcome to the real world
What gave you that idea?
History repeats itself
 @B Ever  why would china invade anyone? 😂😂😂
 @Mystery Man  no not that it doesnt make sense to me, the fact that it doesnt make sense, and also this, youre all so condescending and almighty
You do realize that there are 24 US military baises inside Syria as we speak. Of course that's not prime time news in western media. And also NATO staff left Ukraine last week according to Reuters. What was NATO doing in Ukraine in the first place?
When did you think that? You speak English, chances are our western goverment has  been involved for decades in doing this 😂
Tell that to the U.S. !
I don't think anyone has ever or will ever think that.
Take your face out of your computer and you might SEE
How can the days of invading other countries be over? Have you forgotten America's history of invading other countries? America has provided the lead. Iraq, Libya, Syria, Afghanistan, etc.
they will never be over.
 @MrDJCue  birth pangs of a woman?
Russia tried in 2015 too.
 @Zeus  You are right. If America could invade countries at will and no block cares, why not Russia?
Well..
So u just gonna ignore the middle east
 @old bloke stranded  is your profile pic from Russia?
History always repeats itself.
 @Dark Rising  you get me! They wanted all the smoke then but don't want any of it now... I wonder why
ya but it was in the background of our consious
 @MrDJCue  those man were talkin and writing letters amongst themselves the Bible aint got nothing to do with anything that's going on here
Have you not heard of Iraq or Syria?
 @Wei Tai Cheng  you tried invading Taiwan and Hong Kong
 @Eoin McDonnell  Russia is a Eurasian country, it lies between many geographic spheres
 @old bloke stranded  what you've said means nothing. You literally declared a book people live by, a book that drives the purpose of a significant number of people as making no sense. You reduced it to nothing. It doesn't get more condescending than that, my friend. Many atheists, Bible-haters, etc all feed on viewing Christians as stupid people who just view a story book as a source of wisdom, and if you have that view and want to keep it, that's fine, but we'll see how it all ends
 @Mystery Man  now you are putting words into my mouth, i never said the book doesnt make sense, there are parts that do make sense, i said there are THINGS IN THERE that dont make sense, i am entitled to my opinion. and no you throwing insults for no reason was just condescending. im not a bible hater i just think there are parts to it that seem strange like throwing foreskin onto someones feet and i think some of the things in there are abit far fetched and alot of christians etc always seem to look down on people with different beliefs, and you say we will see how it all ends as if you KNOW how it will end, which is impossible you are as clueless as i am
 @Gaz the jaz  not a clue tbh i think it might be it has been my picture for over 7 years or so
 @old bloke stranded  throwing insults? How? I simply said 
 @Mystery Man  no I took the insult as you comparing me as a kid not understanding somethin I can't remember what you said but it came across as unnecessarily insulting when I was just saying I find some of it hard to believe and that I don't think it makes sense, I know I didn't specify that it's my opinion but i thought that would be kind of obvious tbh all this kind of shit is based on opinions and viewpoints, and you don't need to apologise I was abit of a dick in my response
Techniklee ukraine is not a country it has no borders will revert back to Russia anyway...
Vladimir Putin is not right in the head. He has lost every bit of sanity he had left by going forward with the invasion. I absolutely cannot believe there are people following the orders to invade another country unprovoked.The rest of the world should give 100% military support and all possible resources to Ukraine to fight the Russians.
Isn't this a liberal supporting media platform? Just makes a difference since it's hard to tell if this is fake or real. So much lies and deceit can't really tell if there is truth from the media anymore.
Right Kyjiv!!!!! Kiev says russians!
Dictators have continued ploughing the face of this Globe for personal and nepotic sanctification. Btw, if a nation can attack the other for whatever dubious reason in this era and age,then the roles of international bodies like UN need to be revised.WTF..
All because of a weak ass push over geriatric puppet in office. What the hell is a liberal gonna do about it? Oh that's right... profit off more dead people.
Can you imagine how the  Iraq people felt when America destroyed the lives of millions of people including children    So  putin knows America is behind the trouble in the Ukraine
This is horrific. My thoughts and prayers are with the people of Ukraine please try to stay safe 🙏🏽
Russia and china are the world terrorist groups which prooves now they think they are more powerful then anyone . We need peace not a war do table talk not a war this is our world we want peace its not your world russia
Get the truth out, dont listen to the media
It's official now! Putin is a looney!
Omg this is horrible
So how many troops did Nato place in the border countries of Russia for Putin to loose it and pull their bluff?
Selfish politicians everywhere torturing people the common people
Wise Old Man is probably right, Putin goes unchecked....he could go for more territory. Then you got Taiwan and China....
Please tell me I'm not watching this please tell me 😥
This move will eventually change the global currency. What good are sanctions when the whole economy of another country is being annexed?
this is why philippines(my country) dont want to be a part of nato . they are useless taiwan beware of china . US will not help you in the time of war
I hope the escalation you are thinking up into existence are towned down    people you are not foolish do not buy the pendulum.
Well apparently the economy is good for Russia. USD keeps falling and Rubbles are gaining value.
Media is so biased. They spreading a cooked up narrative. Every honest person knows that the Russians loves their country. If Ukraine is allowed to join Nato, every single Russian knows what that means for them. The west is trying to blindfold people. They didnt even show Ukrainian soldiers once. What happen BBC they hiding? So it's the Kremlin vs Ukrainian civilians right? You guys can't fool us. Peace be with the Ukrainian people but your leader is putting your life at risk by trying to join NATO. You don't do stupid sh!t like that when you know Russia is such powerhouse. America can't save you. That is a nuclear war the world has to avoid. Zelenskyy is dumb and they need to get rid of him for putting his country in this awkward position.
We can’t let China and Russia push other counties around. The world needs to stand up to these two countries and stop there aggressions. I stand with Taiwan a free democratic independent country and I stand with Ukraine a free independent democratic country.
Where is NATO?
No sign of a Ukrainian resistance yet?
The people SUFFERING all the time because of nonsense of politicians
https://youtu.be/LZFFOcVIrac news report
MoSCoW method explained https://youtu.be/q4vwg9QpMnI
So finally US dump Ukraine. What madness, issuing mouth condemnations and economy sanctions for a Country that's using practical weapons to killing civilians. Better to be an ally to Satan than US after all as weekend as Satan he'll be with you in hell.
The Ukrainian gov isn’t a democracy and full of corruption. It sucks for the people but going to war over them is like fighting over two heroin addicts
dapat mgtulong tulong lahat bansa sa Europe o UK .Dahil kpg nakuha nila ang bansa UKRAINE issunod mga katabi bansa..hngng masakop na nila lahat ng bansa sa Europe
The usa needs to stay out of it
im probably gonna get bombed next because russia is a big victim of georgia cya in heaven guys
The war is not Enough,We need a Warsays a small group people in the world.
You both Ukraine and Russia GOVERNMENT must go to another planet and fight there leave the prove alone

Death to Russia
putin go to hell.
U can’t stop Putin if anything just listen to him … it’s not like he did not warn them well in advance. The News hates Russia this is sugar for them
Ukraine is no part of the nato
 @Silas Schmidt  NATO promised to stay with them, because like this promise they are under attack now. This is why no one in this world has trust in US
I Understand Putin desiring to Protect His Country! I Also Understand the Ukraine Leader Desires to Protect His Country!! What I Don't Understand is, how is it ANY DIFFERENT than America living different than Russia, or Japan, or Poland, or Mexico, or Canada!! We have ALL LIVED IN PEACE ALL THESE YEARS!! UKRAINE ONLY WANTS TO LIVE IN PEACE & Independence!! How is this WRONG!! THIS IS TERRIBLE!! PLEASE MAKE SENSE!! PLEASE 🙏 PROTECT YHE INNOCENT PPL!! Y SHOULD PPL SUFFER!! ALL MEN SHOULD LIVE IN PEACE!!
Shitty government
Fake news
The USA's only interest is to put nuclear ballistic missiles on the borders of Russia. Putin is absolutely not paranoiac, he just knows history: this process has been going on for 30 years now and my words are backed up by quite a lot of evidence. The USA and the UK don't give a rat's ass about Ukrainian lives, they just declare they do. The latest proof is Mr Biden's declaration: 
Look what the western allies (mostly USA) and NATO did. They pulled Ukraine into a war knowing that they can’t defend themselves. All they had to say was Ukraine do not qualify to join NATO. NATO have already said they will not fight Russia if Ukraine was to ever go into war with them but the US continue to fuel that propaganda insisting that it’s possible for Ukraine to join. Now that Ukraine is in a war who is helping them or who is going to help them fight Russia? Where are the war tanks, fighter jets, and war ships of the Western Allies? Biden already said he don’t want no smoke with Russia because that would bring a swift ww3 crisis. Shame on the U.S for bamboozling Ukraine into this war and shame on the President of Ukraine for putting his people lives at risk.
Clickbait
Shit unnecessary tension for the people ,Putin has no problem all politicians travel In style and no worry
Better that no one gets involved. Sucks balls that civilians suffer men are stupid enough to kill other men on command from other idiots. Nobody deserves to be killed from some political bullshit, media fucks shit up too. Fuck war.
Don,t Fight Like A Animal You Are Human Being Not A Animal But Why You Fight Like Animal 🥺
It’s the wests fault they should not have given the Ukraine arms.
This is why we don’t need leaders! How dumb it is that one person decides the fate of many. Why are we still doing this in 2022 ???? Why ??
Hello, I live in Bucharest, it's not far from you. I invite as many refugees I can keep in my house (around 3-4 people). It's not a joke, I just want to help.
@2:40 actually  it does look pretty calm more like heavy traffic at the end of a work day
Where is nato good question to the poor guy there good 4 nothing
We can all witness what an evil, power hungary,  autocrat Putin is.  I am happy to hear the people in Russia and showing their disdain and taking to the streers.  Unfortunately, they will pay a price with Putin.
Where’s nato ??? British French Germany this is on your continent!!
EXPLANATION OF THIS ENTIRE CONFLICT👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻West - do you wanna join NATO?Ukraine - yes plzWest - good boyRussia - not in my backyardUkraine - nopeRussia - boom boomUkraine - help NATO, Russia is attacking usNATO - sych that's your problem now.Moral - don't trust US and EU they only care about their interest and profits they're not gonna fight for anything else
May the Lord have mercy on us 😔🙏
The churches in my town,  we give all our blessings to the children, families and people of Ukraine. God bless you from Paul and Charles 2 of the pastors who give you strength.🙏💪🙏
Shame shame on u Putin greedy politicians
god and bless means nothing, it don't change reality,  real life is not magic god will not make a spell to stop the missiles middle air or something, the help should come from other countrys providing shelter and support that makes a difference praying to magic is the same as doing nothing.
god bless you all abundantly
Better run Ukraine president haha like in Afghanistan that mutherfuker took off leaving his people telling them to stay calm you will be the same Mr lol
Let's hope there is this coverage and condemnation the next time America invades a country.
We, peoples of the world, expect an offensive, attacking style from both sides
putin the modern day hitler???
Nice propaganda.
Hypocrisy bullshit always from media. Stay calm, try critical thinking.
The Europeans does this every 2yrs so at least Putin cares about his people. We should as BIDEN can he say the same. We americans know he doesn't.
Russia is doing this for China they’re working hand-in-hand. Ukraine is rich in minerals needed for technology. We’re being played by the one world government as usual
That President of Ukraine is nothing more than just a f**** comedian he could have stopped all this if he agreed to Putin demand simply don't join NATO don't put missiles pointed at Russia and everything will be over but no he had to listen to America how does America feel if China with muscles in Mexico  pointed at American city
Let's not kid ourselvesIf Trump was President, Putin wouldn't be so confidentDonald won't sanction you, he'll kill you dead
You journalists aren't safe either. Putin will roll over you as if your a Ukrainian. Time will prove me right.
If people think Putin will stop at Ukraine then you’ll find something else …..
General Patton said to take over Russia years ago before we have to worry about them,he was correct
Is this the beginning of the world war three?
The only hope now is that there is a coup d'état in Russia to remove Putin and his allies from power. This however, is highly unlikely. If it did happen, it would be the safest, quickest and most effective way of deescalating this situation rapidly.
This is horrible! Why can’t we live peacefully in this world and just mind our own business!!
I imagine this is what afghnistan, iraq, ibya, palestine, Yemen all felt.
Ukrainians amazed me with the footage from their civil war and they amaze me now. Such a resilient people. Have to go through so much for their own freedom. I hope they never fall!
Imagine that… the Russian POS lied. Let’s pretend to be surprised
Go Russian democracy. Greetings from Sweden.
He is like that because Russia backs seperatists in Ukraine eastern region
Greedy and godless people in power
snarling lol haven't heard that word in a long time .
So Russia feels threatened by Ukraine. That's like saying a great white shark is threatened by a goldfish. What an attention seaker nazi Putin is!
The UK schooling Russia not to invade another country is laughable. Remind me who colonized half the world.
God have mercy on these people and take his judgement out on Putin!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAXWAA5GnEI&ab_channel=Dr.SteveTurley
This is why you should never give up nuclear arsenals and sigh any documents with west! Lessons learned for other country's
Putin has for sure mental health issues, just put him on the terrorist list!
No people want war, it's always the governments that want war.
Putin is a f*cling nutter! Someone needs to put him out of his misery for good!! 🤬🤬🤬🤬
This is wrong , my heart goes out to you all 🇬🇧😔
i am no proputin but i also dont trust that fakenews BBC, Bild, and so on. They mix old wavideos , also there is no real proof videos since attack
i'm from Ukraine.🇺🇦 We are scared, but we believe in our army. and we believe in foreign partners to help stop the Russian madness. Thank everybody for support. Peace all of us. 🙏
How is Biden working out for you? Last night was the start of World War 3. The world knows Biden is weak,  Democrat policies are destroying the US and the world and Americans are more divided than ever and they are taking advantage of it. China is watching
NOT LIKE HE DIDN'T WARN THEM...
I feel for the Ukrainian people who have to go through this war, and later we'll lose lose their freedoms
Where in NATO, not only sanctions they need army in field.
Rus höküməti  bunu isəyir. Rus xalqmı insanların qaçqın olmasınımı isdəyir? Bizi Azərbaycanlılar Qarabağdan qovan, didərgin və köçkün edən, öldürən 366 - cı rus alayı idi. İndi də Ukraynlıları evində rahat yaşamağa qoymur. Siz nə isdəyirsiz, ey rusyanı idarə edənlər?
The brink of WW3 is upon us people, Putin has been planning this for years
Ukraine is just no longer gonna be a country now huh
That' history.  Hopefully we have come a long way from there.
 @Susanne  Well to Russia history is important.  The last time western powers  came close to Russian borders ( ww2 ) 20 million russians died. And instead of protesting against NATO's relentless eastward expansion you are blaming Russia. Why didn't you protest when American and British forces toppled and destabilized countries like Iran and Iraq, where was the BBC then ? Where were you when NATO preemptively invaded Serbia ? And now when Putin is using the same exact reason and precedent for invading Ukraine, you are against it. Isn't this hypocrisy of the highest order ? If western countries do it,its to liberate and bring democracy, if Russia does it, its aggression.And I must say, what an excuse you guys have, whenever the UK is reminded of its colonial crimes, their response is 
 @Anwit Mondal  Because you are talking about countries that think its ok to sell 7 year old child brides and dehumanize females.  They can't drive or leave their home without a man.  Ukraine is trying to bring a better state of living to its people.  There's a difference, sorry you can't or won't see that.  I don't care what the reasons are they SAY, but if the result is a better way of life for its people.
 @Susanne  Well are those countries any better after your government's intervention? Look at Iraq now , its worse. Just admit it , western countries have a nature of deciding what's best for others and making a mess
 @Anwit Mondal  It was better, now that the Taliban has taken over its back to where it was.  The peoples life was better with us there, now the women are living in fear again and the baby girls are being sold as brides again.
On Putin and USA! ✊🙏🏻
On USA
Amen
On putin. Ignore the bots
LES GO BOMB UKRAINE
 @Ana  Your attitude is why we may not deserve the planet. If Russia and the US go at it, the world will be uninhabitable.  Your life will end too.
 @Ana  well if I die atleast ill die knowing I didn't do anything to anyone lol but in all seriousness i wish all of the citizens of Ukraine nothing but the best.
 @Miguel Servetus  you right...unfortunately the world still has to deal with people like that...with a terrible attitude and a poverty mentality...hence the comments they made after that too. Pathetic humans
Stay strong - greetings from Russian Israeli.
Putin, stop with the accusation of nazification! You are just a totalitarian tyrant after all.
All nations must be prayer for the world peace to Almighty God!
The dead from Iraq, Libya, Syria, Afghanistan, Palestine, Kashmir send their respect.Welcome to the party and see you all very soon.
Perhaps the coward European countries ought to defend themselves. Why does the US always have to bail them out?
China is watching this. Anytime soon while the international community is busy in Ukraine. China will attack Taiwan.
nato talks a lot, chicken out in reality
The reporter sits with armor while 2 guys chill with tshirts beside him 🤣
💯🇷🇺 great job Russia kill those neo-nazis I wonder US sending military help 🙄🤔
How Biden is still in office is beyond me!
Finally all are humans..pls stop the war..if it's not happen..one day we all will going to face the same situation what Ukraine is facing now..
Fuck Russia
Excellent Propaganda, something the BBC does best, I feel sorry for those without the cognitive ability to critically think and not get sucked in the globalist hive mind narrative..  Bloody idiots.
Not allowed to be FREE = Very sad
1:29 Self defense of what? Their egos, cause they cant back down after creating the situation?
Please don't kill the poor civilians. 😢
If every citizen takes a gun in the hands, imagine what will we get by demilitarization...
😰
wait Putin  is actually using the twitter  SJW 
Why don't they just go bomb them
Her before ww3
Ukraine, say goodbye to some of the freedoms you enjoyed
Lord watch over the civilians. Keep them safe.
I am so sorry that is happening to Ukraine and the entire world.  My prayers and thoughts are with all PEOPLE.  How one person can dictate to invade a country and take innocent lives is beyond my belief.
HI you what do you mean 
I call a killer any leader who is able to do things to protect people but he doesn't do that.
Go Putin.
Stay strong the people of Ukraine. But I know that as our Slavic brothers you will. We never give up without a fight. We will help every Ukrainian in need. Love from Poland 🇵🇱
Putin is the best president in the world take back what's yours Russia ...
My heart hurts and I feel helpless. I just feel like the whole world is slowly but quickly falling apart.
An aging dictator.  A violent ex that can't  accept an old partner has moved on and wants nothing to do with him and his corrupt hole that once contained a heart.
Lying broadcasters being shut down will be a start , lying pigs BBC and every other broadcasters. Free Palestine fuxk you motherfuxkers pigs.
The failure of Ukraine should be blamed on Nato and their friends..... This could of been avoided but good old American democracy fucked it up as usual. Good old Uncle Sam 🙄
Bull shit all of NATO should be boots on the ground in Ukraine why are we making them stan alone ??
Head west, get your families save, then fight like crazed animals. Make the Communist liars pay. Shame on Russia. Your arrogance will doom you all.
Humans are so stupid killing each other over dumb shit. You'd thing after thousands of years of killing each other like this we would've learned how wrong this sort of thing. Fuck putin.
Really stupid put. You lost your mind, no
They dont hurt civilians, right?

 @Olivers Klay  wtf is wrong with you
Yeah what would they do without your thoughts and prayers
 @Olivers Klay  da fuck was that stupid shit
when nato and america does it... it's justified though right????
You say that how one person can dictate and invade a country and take innocent lives as if Russia is the only one done it, all the countries that condemn this move have themselves invaded and taken innocent lives in the past take for example France napoleons invasion,uk invasion of India and colonialism of other countries, USA invasion of Iraq and never found any weapons. All countries condemning this move by Russia have a dark past and can’t judge Russia when they themselves have done worse things on past. This is wrong of Russia yes but doesn’t change the fact that all countries have blood on their hands from their past and shouldn’t fudge Russia as evil when they themselves have done evil.
 @Rorschach T  exactly🤣🤣😅😅 these comments are useless.
 @Yorick Brown 355  doesn’t mean it’s ok to go on and on.
NATO should NUKE russia before its too late, this is just the start of world domination
 @Rorschach T   There is nothing bad about prayer. Creating positive vibrations within ourselves, hurts no one.  You yourself may doubt that prayed does any good. If that is true of you, you are not alone in your belief. I am not faulting you. But the person you were replying to, has a different belief system, and they mean no harm. They are just being a good hearted person. Wouldn`t we prefer good hearted people be left to their positive thoughts?  Prayer helps the people who hold that system of belief, not to feel helpless.   Sweet dreams.
Ukraine accepted NATO without Putin knowledge. They gets what they deserved. Putin said that he attack only military bases.
Putin its  the one are accountable for a people lives
Totally
 @RichSKL  war is like thanos would say inevitable it’s in our human nature to destroy our selves it’s written in our dna 🧬 as bad as it is it brings change. I don’t approve of war but just see the whole picture and the truth which is war is inevitable.
 @Yorick Brown 355  you want war to continue or what?
 @marjorie goodwin  prayers may mean well but they are completely useless
 @Niklas Vilhelm  What we want is irrelevant. War is eternal and inevitable.
It's not beyond belief and well documented. But as long as you keep letting the media do the thinking for you then you will never understand. But hey, you're doing your part by praying to some 'god' right? 😑
America has been doing that for decades
Pathetic 🤡
Crimea is Ukraine
 @Vichkarus  and Ukraine is a sovereign nation 🇺🇦
 @Vichkarus  no it's not.
 @Vichkarus  they want be sovereign.
 @Shegott Dat_ill_NaNa  ah, so that's why they've been annexed by Russia
Putin became insane, and I think that is a sign of an end for his regime
I just wanna say - 
Жыве Украïна! 🇰🇿🇺🇦🇰🇿🇺🇦Fuck Russia
Hitler behind u
​ @Akiyoshi Saitō  Nobody can trust the media. Even the western media is deeply biased and infiltrated by people in power. Look at the NY Times and Times Magazine what they wrote about Russian influence in the US elections. pages and pages of propaganda without any facts at all. That happened just before the midterm elections in the US. The US has done everything they could do undermine relationship improvement between Russia and US. This is just one reason for the situation with the result we are seeing now. So if you look at the media - true you cannot trust Russian media as they are not objective nor critical. But dont think for one minute that western media is different. Just question everything you read. I wish that this war will stop quickly to avoid any more civilian live being lost. This is a great tragedy we are witnessing.
On the other hand, you poles will leave your pants 👖 behind if that had happened to you guys
Because America and nato are the destroyers of this war, look at what has happened before, America is a coward who dares to attack, America is the destroyer of this world, facts, Read the history first. Ukraine used to be, what in Ukraine were mostly ethnic Russians, Russia had to protect its people from western Europeans, Mamarika and Natos
TOYOTA Trucker Lives Matter 💯 -Scotty Kilmer
NATO should NUKE russia before its too late, this is just the start of world domination
 @peter hansa  that's because of the us forbids censorship of private companies, you can trust the official federal news outlets
 @Wildan permana  Americans aren’t cowards it’s the idiot running this country
stoimy razem, Polska i Ukraina 🇵🇱🇺🇦🇺🇲
 @Hairy Rokeke  great idea, start a nuclear war lol. Then the whole planet is dead
Poles were hoping for Caucasian immigrants .. good news you got them now.
Meanwhile. Russia helps thousands of civilians and refugees from another part of Ukraine which have been bombed and shelled for 8 years. This medal has two sides. But BBC wants you to see only one.
 @Akiyoshi Saitō  oh what a perfect Ukr bot
hes coming for Poland too
It is a sovereign nation and was never rightly Russian
Unfortunately, this is how the world has always been, tragedies, sickness, and wars.
Yes, as long as US continues its policy of exceptionalism, meddling in others affairs, inciting wars, sponsoring terrorism, colour revolutions, separatism, effecting regime changes, committing and covering up war crimes, this world will never find peace.
Yes always has for thousands of years.
Russia are bombing Ukraine not the US
Not my part of the world.  We know better.
These things have happened in the past. History repeats itself mate
If you have anyone is Ukraine get into contact with me and we can evacuate them to poland
with just one country?
 @FactsMatter  blame the world. they're the ones rejecting the freedom we're brining to them
 @FactsMatter  Dude, Putin has wanted this since before he even took office. Stop blaming the US just because you're some anti-American propagandist and look at the proper facts for once.
Its really sad because there was so many people who lost their lives durring this. And this is just the beggining.  i hope its just this and it'll end but its very unlikely. I pray for the Ukraines.
We need trump back
Yep, look what's happening in Palestine.... The Jews don't give a fuck
Yup blame it on humans
The world has really turned to shit the last few years
 @Girl Power  you think that
Exactly! I feel the same! Portals of hell have opened wide all over 💔
 @Luigi Puzzle  Hahahaha you’re saying that the world is rejecting the freedom that is brought by the USofAss?US has brought nothing but death and destruction since its founding. Since then, it has been at war for over 220 years! In fact the land it sits on is stolen land and land gained from genocide of the indigenous. Then how about slavery? If you think slavery is a thing of the past, you’re a f$&king 1d1ot. There is modern day slavery still happening as we speak!How much freedom did US bring to the Marshall Islands, Libya, Syria, Vietnam, Iraq, Yemen, Yugoslavia, Serbia and Afghanistan. As if it’s not enough to invade, occupy and commit war crimes against a sovereign nation for 20 years, US has now stolen (S T O L E N) Afghan money while women and children are freezing and starving to death. How free do they feel?Everytime Americans run out of rhetoric they always throw in the ultimate bullshit, which is, we are defending “democracy” and “freeeeedoooom” 🙄
 @FactsMatter  ye it’s definitely just always the US, US do this and that, US is responsible for everything
 @You  I dont think that I know.
 @Johari Aez Soriao  You are absolutely right
 @xFrosty Resonance  Dude, really? How do you know that Putin has wanted this since even before he took power? Where is the evidence or do we just rely on US “intelligence”?I am looking at the “proper” facts. Perhaps you should as well.US has wanted war since its founding. The Ukraine crisis is no different and is a direct result of US meddling. NATO has expanded eastward against the protestations of Russia and is continuing to do so. A sovereign nation has the right to national security but not at the expense of another.US instigated a coup in 2014 and installed a US nazi puppet regime. Since then, Ukraine has ignored the Minsk Agreement and has killed over 14,000 Russian ethnics in eastern Ukraine. In the past six months, US and UK have sent an armada of warships to the Black Sea, 5,000 miles away from Washington, and have flown nuclear capable bombers near Russia’s airspace. US and UK have sent troops and weapons to Ukraine and have ignored Putin’s request to stop NATO’s eastward expansion. Ukraine has deployed troops and military equipment on Russia’s border. They even have US missiles aimed at Moscow. Last week, Ukraine was talking about developing nuclear capability.One cannot be accused of being an anti-American propagandist when one is speaking the truth. US IS the biggest warmongering criminal in modern history. A little fact checking would confirm that fact.Just to help you out, look up Yugoslavia, Iraq, Serbia, Libya, Syria and Afghanistan.
 @Luigi Puzzle  Freedom huh? That's coming from a country that was built on the slavery, sweat, blood and tears of so-called black people, as well as the betrayal of the native and true Americans. Your foreign policy till this day is still coated in lies and deceit. The United Snakes will fall harder than any World power in history. Mark my words.
NATO should NUKE russia before its too late, this is just the start of world domination
 @Hairy Rokeke  yeah just nuke millions of innocents that makes perfect sense.
 @FactsMatter  right so how did that lead to Russia invading Ukraine again?
 @Girl Power  where are you from?
That's humans for you
 @Ânyà Štár ✨  yeh it sucks
America doesn’t care, so as long as it keeps expanding and wanting to dominate and interfere with other countries affair and use its dominant media network to spread propaganda and brainwashing, it will continue until Russia and China wiped out.Then when the resource becomes so scarce, this will all happen again
 @FactsMatter  the world will never find peace. Only one that will be able to save us is Jehovah
 @xFrosty Resonance  US interfered with Ukraine political system and led to orange revolution - after which Ukraine is just a tool of America , I will leave the rest of thinking to you
@raininthespringtime exactly how I feel
 @Fors3s  yes it is
 @FactsMatter  Putin has literally said he believes the fall of the USSR was the greatest tragedy of the 20th century. He has literally said that he wants to rebuild Russia to its former glory. Whether or not he has said if he wants to invade Ukraine, doesn't matter. Because Ukraine is part of what the USSR used to be, and he wants the Soviet Union back.
 @Hairy Rokeke  Then they lauch their nukes and the world becomes an apocalyptic hellhole. I still remember the cold war, so learn duck and cover.
 @Johari Aez Soriao  But in the past people we weren’t put in classes to learn about the consequences that comes from war. After all those classes we still haven’t learned. History doesn’t repeat itself if learn to prevent it from happening in the first place and understand what leads to war.
 @xFrosty Resonance  🤣🤣🤣America created the Ukraine crisis by putting missiles in silos on Russia’s door step.America has been to blame for every war since 1776. Learn your history.
 @imCracked  if I have to spell it out any more than I have, then there’s no point.
I love that the first thing everyone goes to is that America was built on slavery, the whole fn world was built on slavery and wore mongering, not saying what happend in our past was the way to go but to go as far back as history goes there has always been slavery, war, civil war and double crossing for all countries advantage over each other..........ffsake.
This is horrible, My heart goes out to the civilians.
you should seriously get out more often...
 @Lew LC  if that happened the nukes are getting sent
Your heart didn't fall apart when nazis do their marshes in Kiev? When battalion Azov torched Russian people in Donbass - your heart didn't fall apart? Or you just didn't know about nazis marshes in Ukrain. They make nazis criminal Benders their hero. Grandfathers who participated in the WWII on the side of nazis - arrange parades on the Kiev's streets.
 @xFrosty Resonance   dude, keep up with real news NOT propaganda. He has asked Zelensky for 2 things,1. Move foreign weapons out of Ukraine, and2. Guarantee that Ukraine will remain neutral, non-aligned,and the conflict will be over.2 simple and reasonable requests that are consistent with what Putin has been saying for months.
 @FactsMatter  this is literally between UKRAINE and RUSSIA yet you still find a way to blame the US LMAO
 @FactsMatter  although very true. I find it odd that the US doesn’t want any part in this
russia is run by a delusional old man, maybe it's time to finally put an end to his reign. it's scary, everyone is scared of their 'power,' but no country can live and prosper while being run by a selfish madman.
At least we stopped the mean tweets of Donald Trump. 45 would have prevented the world from crumbling with an iron fist of American might and know-how.
It’s just we know how to do it faster and with more distruction
 @FactsMatter  what an ignorant statement. Please stfu. The us has been around for a little over a couple hundred years and countries where still descimating eachother before, just stfu
 @Girl Power  no governmemt 
 @Jhhshsh Ushehhe  you’re obviously a western media propaganda fed ign0ramus. Are you aware that this all started because US sent warships to the Black Sea, 5,000 miles away from Washington, and was flying nuclear capable bombers near Russian airspace? Are you aware that US has been sending weapons and “advisors” to Ukraine? Are you aware that NATO is obsolete but yet is used by the US to push Russia into a corner?Yea, it’s US’s doing like so many other conflicts around the world.
 @paulthorpee  FUCK TRUMP and Biden!! Trump wouldn't do shit either.
 @beano  you mean in the last 200 years
 @Tesla Bot  US never intended to help Ukraine. They were using Ukraine as a pawn to push Russia into a corner. Now that that’s been achieved, US will wash its hands, walk away, and impose sanctions on Russia.It’s all about arms sales, containing Russia, distracting Americans from the problems at home and an attempt to lift Biden’s ratings.
 @imCracked  facts!!
 @Alberto R  hahahaha well, f$&k U too. You’re so f$&king $tupid. Yea, US has been around for about 250 years, but yet it’s been at war for over 220 years. That is a fact and it might give you a clue about your $hithole country. Stay ignorant, ya f$&king muppet 🤡
Not a single headline on Palestine whilst people die daily , funny how they’re all up Ukraines arse. And oh yeah putins just taking his land back fuxk yous. Yeah

How can it be 
Is it me or does putin look like dobby the house elf from Harry Potter !!
Excuse my language but....fuck Putin andbhis army up!
Oho Lord
im thinking 1 nuke would take care of putin
Well boys it has begun⚔
Can this affect the USA ?
The delusional western media has zero credibility with the public because they have repeatedly lied to us for decades. They no concept of what is happening.
Gislaine Maxwell can provide even more insight into why Emergency Powers is a cudgel. If Canada didn’t repeal it Ukraine would not be blowing up right now. Why did Mussolini shake Alistair Crowley upside down? To see why he always lands on his feet.
Putin is psychotic . Ukraine president is an idiot
PUTIN KHUYLO!!! 🇺🇦
War is coming for all of us. He won't stop with Ukraine. Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania or Moldova will be next. We will have to take a stand at some point. You should all prepare yourselves.
How about israel - palestine.? They war.. And nothing to do for that.
And Trump thinks Putin's moves are brilliant
Are you sure is wasn’t a man in a cave
Putin , Make love not war. Ukraine president ,Make war not love
So tell me why. Politics is the issue. Nato needs to back off, simple.
as biden sits by and watches, he doesnt even know where Ukraine is
Why is there no footage of the conflict ???
I know that was about to happen Ukraine is not behave
My heart goes out to all muslim countries that's been damaged by Amerika and all other snakes that killed innocent children
🇺🇦🇦🇿
Biden handed Russia and China the keys for a full scale invasion on Ukraine and Taiwan. He's depending on that. He is making an attempt to hide his and his crackhead son's business deals. Coming up next. WWII. And the world thought Trump was going to start it. Well here's all the proof that you need that is wasn't Trump.
As much as I hate to say it, this is the price of playing neutral, you have no friends but yourself, I hope in the modern day this serves as an example of why you can’t play both sides.
Ireland back Russia 100% Fuck the UK and the US the people of Donetsk and Luhansk have the right not to be bombed by the Ukraine army and to choose their future!!
After this, It'll be Germany's turn to be Europe's boogieman.
wow i felt this one hey why does Governments fights each other?
This is so bad for the entire world.
Fuck all these countrys that have so called 
Apparently Vladi forgot that times has changed and he's only making things worse for him and his people. Especially the fact that he's harming civilians
The BBC is so crap
chill bro
Meanwhile Western beta male leaders continue to yip yap
I also want to clarify I in no way think any of this is good, my heart goes out to all the Ukrainians suffering from this horrible mess
I think the man is evil and cares not that civilians are being harmed.
What a self defense when you are the aggressor and you re attacking  helpless people..
Hitler invaded Poland 1939. History repeating itself over in some way
Putin devil
I wish people would pronounce the name of the capital   (Ki  Ev) Key & Ev as in ever.  My rant on that, but because our government drug their feet & the ineptitude is absolutely gold star level....!!
Putin explains...and the fake news say he's lying...jeez.
Iv been brain storming, how can the Ukrainian s fight back effectively. And how they be helped to counter the Russians. Every one/army has a weak point.
My support to all the people. But, There is no way putin can let nato closer in eastern ukraine because he fear that.  this is beyond being a civillian. The world has only one option now : let putin get three provinces and close the conflict soon as possible, putting sanctions on china wont help either cuz they have outside support. Other ways are lost.... you cant attack a nuclear power...
Prayers for everyone,so sorry you have to go through the madness
The people of Ukraine are leaving in droves. their getting the military pounded because the Ukraine military can't  defend itself.  And what gets me is, the so called world, is going to step in where the Ukraine people will not... F**K'em. The Russians deserve a people like that and via-versa.
Nope russia wont control the air long before US canada and the UK start to use thier supior 22s
1939 Second war started when Hitler attacked Poland and now 2022
Russia using leftie tactics lol
This is what happens when the leader of the free world is a stuttering feeble senile weak old man.
wars start, innocents kill, politicians make money
This is possibly the beginning of world war III
Leaders and people behind this are all EVIL.
Russia dosnt strike civilian housing
It’s always the civilians that pay the price of wars it’s a shame they can’t talk it out on the table
This is a war America and Nato wanted Ukraine to fight know they wouldn't help. Poor Ukraine they should of gone natural but they listed to America.
If Ukraine was a part of NATO they would be protected unfortunately the president of Ukraine didn’t want to join NATO so you can’t be mad at NATO. I get fighting for what you believe in but when you’re going against power hungry individuals that have more military power it’s best to just come to some type of agreement or withdraw/ceasefire to prevent all out war. Unfortunately the Ukrainian president has this false idea they can win this battle when they can’t. Unfortunate series of events, very bad leadership on both Ukraine/Russia. No solutions, no peace.
They did
enjoy as youve pushed russians too far for 8 yrs - always guilty,one thing ill say sad to see from both countries none the less - keep you western noses out or you are totally stupid,than continue to intimidate bear with a stick
This isn’t new news what happening with Israel 🇮🇱 bombing Palestine 🇵🇸 no one talking about that no one even cares this is a joke
Western country especially like 🇬🇧 and 🇺🇸,they are trouble maker and always confuse the right and wrong
All cause of literally 1 guy. Can musk send over a falcon 9 on this guys house?
Man Putin is seriously flexing his muscles and doesn’t seem like the world can do anything but cry and complain. I never thought Russia would be able to do the things they do without really any resistance.  NATO and United States might be done policing the world. It’s pretty much a done deal. Russia can do anything and all we can do is watch or not watch and get on with our lives. Absolutely nothing anyone can do against Russia. Praying for all those effected by this war. Hopefully Russia can play nice but without any resistance I think we’re going to just see more of this.
Bbc in full bullshit mode
Where are NATO and US when you need them? Russian military should have not entered easily. If you are not a rich country I guess there is no urgency for help from other nations.
Sanctions against Russia !!!
Isn't Putin,Destroying his own country,In accordance to his,Own thinking?Why would he destroy,His own Soviet nation?He did claim it as his,Along with other people's lives.There is only one reason,Why Putin would destroy,What he already assumes to own,Ukraine and its people,As well as Belarus.Why?A house divided,Between itself is known to fall,But not well known,As Satan's buiding plans.Only a possessed man,Would enslave,Kill and destroy his own nation,Claiming to save it.Astyroth owns Putin now.Putin must be rebaptized,Because he has committed Schism,The highest crime in Orthodoxy.Schism?Yes,Ukraine has its own Orthodox Church,Which,'Putin the Possessed,'Degraded during his speech,As a possessed man would.
Russia want a peace!
Yes Putin denazify Ukraine 🇷🇺🙌🏼
Why almost every comment here people talking about praying for Ukraine. Don't you see that prayers are BS. With all those praying I want to see if Russia gonna stop.
That building wasn’t hit by a rocket. The was no structural damage, just a random fire. The Media is whipping up a frenzy as a justification for the west to intervene. Could have something to do with gas pipes IDK 🤷
False Flag Anyone????
Let us pray seriously
comrade trump supports this. Maga
Guess Ukraine giving up it's nuclear weapons was a bad decision
This is an UNACCEPTABLE!
To much talk where is the USA and EU ?
Let the world go to hell
Ukraine was nazified in the first place 🤡
Putin is the only nazi in this
 @Sam Jones  Azov Battalion is a Neo Nazi military group.
 @Sam Jones  Putin is against Nazis hence he’s going to denazify Ukraine. He said it himself. Stop being a Nazi shill.
What??
dont fuck with putin..... cabalist
We band together to fight warlords in underdeveloped countries, why do we shy away from fighting warlords in developed countries. The longer you wait, the more powerful they get.
Remember MSM lie, they can tell you anything and forge pictures. Or use old pics, Russia only after military installations . Not civilians.Not like west that murder for fun with their bombs.
Ukraine shouldn't have let them get set up and surround there country. Never would that happen here.  Should have gotten ready
Sorry for them but if it was Pakistan all the people go out to the front line no matter what happened to them but never lost hope
In 1954( 70 yrs back) Albert Einstein was asked to share his instincts on world war III. This was his response: 
WowMr Putin Teach them.Ukraine president was bragging few days back saying there's no war en his army are so well trained ready to defend the country. Where are they now😀😀😀😀😀
Is there nazis in Ukraine?  How bad is it.Whos this Azov guys?
Get ready for millions of refugees
lollllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll Ops
World War III has begun, I'm afraid...and Putin has warned that he has a huge nuclear arsenal
Wait For Nato ?Your Country Is Not Member Of NatoUS & UK Only Defend Their Nato Organism
This is bad #saveukraine
Naja, diese Asow Brigaden welche für die Massaker in Odessa verantwortlich waren, endlich auszulöschen kann so verkehrt eigentlich garnicht sein.
The embattled Ukrainian President who now fears for his job....Is this Station now completely out of touch with the realities of this world?? If the Russians take the Ukrainian President, he will not be allowed to live. Propaganda station this one... leave mainstream media all of you
They show the 'scary Russian police' peacefully putting a person in a van, and call it horrible. Did these people not watch US police beating the absolute shit out of BLM protestors????????
Tell-a-vision. Be careful what you believe.
Ohhh come on where is your nato and your American  wtf thy said and what they are doing ??? Fk off America to push Ukrainian in war
No its you that started war on the world wich will never be yours democrate scum
It was unprovoked
No, the only nazi is putin
ITS TERRIBLE AND HORRIBLE...............  IS JUST THE ICEBERG PEAK
Are we at the brink of WW3?
I am Russian and I am terrified of what is happening. Know that none of us wants war. Many of my friends have relatives in Ukraine. We have always been friendly nations.
Dirty animals
Once KGB always KGB
Just when the world is getting back to normal after corona 😒😒
Anybody expecting US to save Ukraine your out of luck !!!!Biden only good at bullying his own people.Let this be a lesson to the world what happens with weakness abound in leaders like Biden,
Russian say Ukraine are back stabber they did in past an last 15 year ben doing it blacking their access to black water . now pay back time.  Russian no moor trick and treat.
Where is sleepy Joe
As we know only NATO can make surgical attacks.
Heartbreaking💔 for the ppl of Ukraine and their ancestors for what Independence their country accomplished now this bs...
this reminds me of the lead up to ww 2 i bet the west will keep its santion talk and putin will keep testing there resolve until he is fully confident they are as weak willed as he suspects and try another country and champerlin or biden will keep trying to find a diplomatic solution forgeting he is in a completely different game that was played in the cold war and with hitler he needs putin to believe he is willing to launch a nuclear war and he lost that opportunity by taking out american troops. so long as ground is given ww3 is inevitable unfortunatly youd think lessons from the failure with hitler would be known by our leaders it makes me very sad i just hope the people of ukraine get out ok and im wrong.
What go around come around
Срби и Руси братья навсегда!
This is stupid! It never should have happen if not for the west. They kept on wanting Ukraine to join NATO. wrong move. You know how important Ukraine for the Russians. Tsk.
Damn you Putin!
Russia 🇷🇺 pawor 💪💪💪💪🇷🇺🇷🇺💪💪💪💪💪🇷🇺Ukarina belong to Russia 🇷🇺🇷🇺💪💪
Inevitable and only one outcome.
Putin is the new HITLER and the world is letting him kill innocent people Sanctions are not going to work with a madman!!!!! Let’s go NATO     Put a stop to this    Look at all the people who are running Russian President is killing people
Do you think it will come to the US?
Get on the streets, protest against war
Thats always the case. Its hardly EVER the citizens of the nations campaigning for war. Its the govts! God bless both Ukrainian and Russian civilians
 @2023 LE  As the USA is in this thing in the background,there is a strong possibility..
 @butragenjo 007  that’s what I was thinking
 @butragenjo 007  You think putin would give a shit about some people protesting? He would probably just 
 @The Einzelganger  Agreed. Especially as we have such weak leadership
 @2023 LE  It's not the President that fights, it's it's people.  We have a strong military and if it came to it, I believe it would be the one thing that can band us together
 @L0ading4Ever  he said none of them wants war, so if all of them protest it would at least embarras him
 @Susanne  the military doesn't call the shots
 @butragenjo 007  Even if it did, he would still go on like nothing happened
 @2023 LE  Neither does the President in most cases. What does Biden know of war? except how to avoid the draft?
 @2023 LE Never. Unlike our last president, our current president is not one of Putin's fanboys.
I am an American. It is important to remember that no matter what happens, what wars come, how we feel about leaders and armies, we cannot hate each other.
@GoldenState  😂😂 if you knew anything you'd know you keep your enemies closer than your friends.. sleepy Joe doesn't know what he's a fan of or even where he is for that matter!!
 @Samuel W  this is true ❤
 @GoldenState  Biden is Putins puppet just like Obama was.
and to think there are American 🤡 support this Putin
The President of the Russia is a warfreak its getting Crazy🙄
There has been a treaty for years that the Ukraine will never be in Nato... it's the equivalent of Russia putting nukes on the Mexican boarder to the US.. Nato and the US know this.. they have been sending weapons and pushing for a war... vault 7 leak showed the CIA can hack and leave another countries 
The territory you seek to claim, you fire missiles upon destroying both infrastructure and killing civilians? In self defense no less, don’t think so.
Putin is evil, the Russian people must overthrow Putin.
Once KGB always KGB
USA push Ukrain in the war and now they are alone, now it show that Ukrain is on the mercy of Russia...Lolwhy Ukrain trust on USA.....
Mr.Trump just called Putin pretty smart and genius. OMG. I call him the new Hilter of the world. GOD help  Ukraine for its freedom.
I stand with russia
Bullshit   housing was hit by ukraine
This is madness. Playing games with peoples lives n destroying homes.is this putin guy ohk?
in Canada protests are illegal too apparently
bruh
fight
And at the very same time the Russian netmob youtube bot account has also assaulted the youtube.
❤️❤️❤️ my heart is breaking for these people
Our world peace is disrupted by the West and the US propaganda. Look at now, no one can stop this war immediately.
Europeans are educated and speaking English… Americans on the other hand can’t be helped to interest in leading any other language
Sending my love and prayers from the UK🙏💔
As long as Russia has China's support, they are untouchable.
Sadly Russian citizens dont know who the evil bully is. They are controled by propaganda. Russians are fed false information to get them on there government side. No different than what china or north korea does. Citizens just want to live and go about there everyday life. But some governments want to control and take more.Ukraine is no threat to Russia. But putin thinks so. People that are evil always fear the good.Stand tall Ukrainians and god bless you all. Even though you walk through the valley of the shadow of death fear no evil for god is with you.
!where is NATO and the USA...steups
Time to take Putin out
Typical spineless, hypocritical nato and west.
Why won't they show what was bombed
The truth is there is no war!
Is Ukraine an independant country? Or it is under Russia?
2022 OMG! What happened this V.Putin
So is ww3 about to finally start
Biden dont give a shit about Ukrainę
Honestly this is very bad from Russian military it’ll not only affect lives and properties if this escalate then the stock markets will be really affected crypto price rates are already fluctuating on the dip side. Say no to war, Pray for Ukraine 🇺🇦 .
😢
Nobody can mess around putik. Nuke cloud is beauty.
I wish my country would join them and fight .
They should stop fighting 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭.
Everyone’s hearts are breaking for Ukraine. Hope it did as well for Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and Syria.
NATO set Ukraine up to be knock down like bowling pins. Then run like NAZI COWARDS they are.???
BBC MIERS
Other way round dummy. What does Russia want with the west lol, he just does not want nato on its border yet the west keep pushing. That's the only reason he's been forced to push this invasion
You’ve got a deep vision thought.
Regardless of the current crisis an advice to everyone reading this comment. If you don't find a way to multiply the money, one day you will wake up and realize that the money you thought you had is gone. Investment is key.
Crypto currencies especially bitcoin is the future investing in it right now will be on every wise one's list and in a month you'll be ecstatic about the decision.
Yeah I'll still hold for long term I still got more than 12BTC and still scalping and holding more. Russia pls no war:))
The rich stay rich by spending like the poor and investing without stopping then the poor stay poor by spending like the rich yet not investing like the rich
Most people remain poor only because friends and relatives discouraged and advised them against investing and trading crypto  while the wise ones kept investing and growing higher financially.
Pls Guys How does this whole bitcoin thing work, I'm interested in it and I'm willing and ready to invest heavily but I need an assistant to properly guide me through on how to make a good start up and be successful in it without making mistakes...
[Bitcoin] is a very exciting development, it might lead to a world currency. I think over the next decade it will grow to become one of the most important ways to pay for things and transfer assets.
You have a brilliant cash flow idea.  After my crypto experience, I now believe that investing today is a simple logic that creates you a future where you don't need to work.  I invested in both stocks and cryptocurrencies, but now I can see that cryptocurrencies are more profitable and easier to invest than stocks.
Bitcoin is still the future for the wise who will understand what opportunities these current dips offer, now is the best time to get a portfolio manager and restrategize trading plans that only a few will do and understand that the dip still makes me profit from trading Don't just sit and hold bitcoin!
Exactly!!  Financial stability may or may not have a rich background anyway.  Most people think... Investing in *crypto is about buying coins and holding them, until it goes up, come on, it takes a lot of analysis to be a successful cryptocurrency trader.  I made £47k in just two weeks of trading.  Thank you Natasha Byam Jativa, a great example of a professional portfolio manager.
Ma'am, you have a good point here, ignorantly people don't know that the crypto world is more of a lucrative business and investment nowadays.
OMG!  you also trade with Mrs. Natasha!  I thought people didn't know her that well... she's really amazing!
Thanks to my crypto portfolio manager, natasha!  I just invested $20k in alcoins and $50k in Ethereum.  With the recent crash in Crypto, I was told that it is the right time to invest and establish myself and see me become a millionaire soon.
My first investment with Natasha Byam Jativa gave me a profit of $80,000 US dollars and since then she has never failed to deliver and I still say she is the most honest broker I have ever met.
I just made my first withdrawal last week and I wasn't happy with myself because I was skeptical which made me invest so law in the meantime I'm on my second trade with her and this time I invested big.
Natasha's strategies cannot be compared to others, she is very accurate and helped me grow my portfolio by over €39,000.
I am very happy to take the bold step of working and investing $12000 with her after one week I received $26468 in my bank.
I've never heard or seen any of her clients complain about losing... I think she's too perfect.
I met her last year for the first time at a conference in London, I invested £25,000 and traded in a month earning close to £200,000
I think she turned my 3 BTC into 9.1 BTC in just 3 weeks, she truly is the best, having my investment with her has been the best decision I have ever made.
Техт нег оп шндтs дрр ↓↓
十 ① •⑤•⓪•⑨•②•⑥•②•⑧•⑧•⑤•①
Thanks so much!
My previous trade with her gave me a total profit of €42,000, so I will definitely make a new trade this week.
No doubt Mrs Natasha Services is very good, I invested $20,000 and made a profit of $61,700 after 3 weeks.  I still wonder how he gets his analysis.
In fact, crypto currency is the best digital investment.  Earning 3 times my salary soon I won't have to work anymore, people should start participating in this kind of digital investment, it's the best.
I have seen different testimonials of natasha, she must be very exceptional for people to speak so highly of her services.
Dont start with this
Our hearts are always broken for the innocents lost in any conflict. Peoples whom are simply trying to live their lives only for governments to to destroy that.
 @Joa S  The truth hurts doesn’t it ?
 @AyAron  No
 @AyAron  it actually doesn't.
American destroyed democracy by supporting it's installed dictatorships or elected nazi fascism and now democracy is failing everywhere and not few weeks back stole money from poor Afghans who had no role in 9-11.
And its rider had a bow, and a crown was given to him, (Greek for crown is corona) and he came out conquering, and to conquer. When he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, 
Zelensky and his family need to get out NOW!
For 8 years, Ukraine bombed Russians in the LPR and DPR - where was the BBS?  ????
Let me know when will be another way around, Ukraine with all NATO entering in Russia when PUTIN is not there anymore... Russians should pray that in the Future will be another president like PUTIN.
D E N A Z I F I C A T I O N
Pray for Ukraine guys 🙏 hope it gets stopped by the earliest.
Biden and NATO handed you over to Russia!
He doesn't want your country, or to harm it, he wants what's best for you both really being so intricately and respectively geographically important to one another, mainly doesn't want a new NATO expansion anywhere east of Germany. Ukraine's nationalism is being exploited all around, NATO clearly didn't care and Ukraine should note that
Eish that terrible man Putin clawn premitive,creature, rascal a wicked man.A blood thirsty always thinks àbout the shadding of innocence blood.What is that where is America to avoid such a cruel act barbarism.We saw them distroying Iraq and lybia and now it is their match here .Go fight and stop Russia for further attacking on that country.
🙏🙏🙏
They voted for NATO. They opened their doors to USA and the UK. Now pay the price
Things are rarely what they initially appear to be. Personally I believe this has all to do with the 
You mean the 200k troops on the border were there for an attack ??My god, what a surprise  !!!!
i didn't actually think it would have to come to this, all because putin wanted everything to be how it was before the fall of the soviet union. i pray for the safety of all the civillians, children, parents/adults and everybody else. this is terrifying and even more terrifying for the people living there experiencing this..
this is soo sad
Why can't the one's that disagree fight to death, like Russian roulette or sum. Y involve/ kill innocent ppl over their pathetic little disagreements? Wars r so pointless, it takes ppl to build a country but if all the ppl r gone what will be left of the country? Ashes? What will be the point of all that bloodshed, the say it's for their ppl but have they actually considered or asked what their ppl want? Im sure it ain't war and bloodshed! The ppl that they r willing to start a war for just to protect will end up dead and their blood will be on the initiators hands
Let' s g o Bra n do n !
It's going to stop if the west gets involved but than it's literally WW3
It’s like pol pot in cambodia. You can force things back but the world has already moved on. Taking Ukraine won’t bring the Russia economy back to soviet days. Not that it was really good before anyways.
NATO should NUKE russia before its too late, this is just the start of world domination
 @Hairy Rokeke  What an utterly unintelligent thing to write. There is a limit to free speech you know. Nato should do exactly what they are doing - nothing more and nothing less. OMG
Putin only wants NATO not to accept Ukraine as their member.But the west ignore him.Russia and Ukraine is one people.Russia originated from KyivanRus.NATO and the US should stop moving east.Good for them,they are not facing this war,it's the Ukrainian.They can  say all they want that Kiev has their back.But the sad reality is,the armies of Ukraine and it's people will fight this war,not them.But,still,in a war,there is no winner.#notowar#
Putin wants access to the black sea
Why are you directing your blame towards Putin? NATO is the terrorist organisation here. USA and England are the biggest warmongers and satanists in history.
 @Trips  you are 100%right
No he wants everything to be the way it was before the communist took over, he blames them for destroying the Russian Empire that had been going strong for over 300 years.
 @シ︎★purplxs★ #losingsubs  putin like a spoiled kid with a loaded gun its all about i want me me me....
 @シ︎★purplxs★ #losingsubs  Not a single round was fired towards russia, it was a made up empty threat, Russia is and has always been the aggressor. I've always said that Russia was the true real enemy, I was proven right.
 @シ︎★purplxs★ #losingsubs  blame the west and nato because they intervened ....they force the Russia to act
 @Zyx  BRO THAT WAS MY DAD THATS NOT ME
 @Geovanne Isanan  kk
Putin's lies are as brazen and ridiculous are Republicans are in US.The idea of Ukraine being a threat to Russia is too stupid for words!!!
Zelinski please go to hell ukranian or UE people don't want war or nato
Don't worry, sanctions will sort that out.
this might escalate very badly.
Jesus!! Why can't we live live in peace? I just don't understand this meaningless war
The Russian Bear is doing exactly what Bible prophecies indicated. The Bear is in Daniel 7, Ezekiel 38, and Revelation 13. Gog and Magog. The feet of the Beast World Government, and the principal antagonist at Armageddon. Expect Russia to increase its presence and power on the global stage until Jesus returns. There is no cause to panic every time Russia moves. Fear God and nothing else. Prepare for Great Tribulation. Keep the Faith. God will see us through.-Bro Ken RaggioPlease go read acts chapter 2 in KJV Bible!!!  We may die in this life but to live with Jesus Christ eternally in heaven we must follow this plan of salvation!!
Face reality Ukraine. Surrender and negotiate the best deal you can with the Russians. NATO is too weak to help.
The NATO countries are a bunch of cowards for not standing up to a fascist Russia's aggression against Ukraine for aspiring to build a free democratic state! This is a repeat of the 1930s Munich betrayal:Before leaving Munich, Chamberlain and Hitler signed a paper declaring their mutual desire to resolve differences through consultation to assure peace. Both Daladier and Chamberlain returned home to jubilant welcoming crowds relieved that the threat of war had passed, and Chamberlain told the British public that he had achieved “peace with honour. I believe it is peace for our time.” His words were immediately challenged by his greatest critic, Winston Churchill, who declared, “You were given the choice between war and dishonour. You chose dishonour and you will have war.” Indeed, Chamberlain’s policies were discredited the following year, when Hitler annexed the remainder of Czechoslovakia in March and then precipitated World War II by invading Poland in September. The Munich Agreement became a byword for the futility of appeasing expansionist totalitarian states.Today, Germany sold security and stability in Europe for Putin's bloody gas. Ukrainians are paying with theirt freedom, their blood, and lives for your gas, Germans.You as well as the rest of Europe pay when millions of Ukrainian refugees fleeing Russian barbarian hoards will flood your countries!Russian trolls and propagandists openly laugh at the West: US, Germany and other EU and NATO countries as a whole as a bunch of cowardly 
A true leader
I support the white guys...damn that's both sides lol
You have been pouring mud and lies on Russia for so long that now there is no need to complain.rYou have been pushing Ukraine to war with Russia for 8 years, all for the sake of enriching your rich people who are trying to destroy a competitor in the face of Russia, you filled the world with lies, distracting people's attention from the true reasons. And the truth is one, the interests of traders. Keep pouring your lies into the ears of Western viewers, we will come to you, and you will pay for every word of lies.
I stand with Ukraine
May God see you through Ukraine people
Ukraine elected a comedian. What do you expect.
Whens the next Russia V Ukraine football match?
Exactly what Pootin is accusing Ukraine of being Nazism is exactly what Pootin & the Republic of Russia is..., Nazi's. KGB Commie tactics.. This is a perfect example of what communism is and does.
violence always seems to be the answer when other means of negotiation fail and it is pitiful to see
War was never a solutions people haven't learn anything from the past...
Never be fooled , War is not about ideology(its an excuse )it's always about resources.  Sadly, once again, on the worlds stage, we see this hostile attempt by an aggressor play out once again, in real time. It's time for Nato and it's allies to step the hell up!  God be with the peoples of Ukraine.
1:44 bullshit
поздраыляю всех с подавлением фашизма и предательство в  Украине. Надо уважать самоопределение людей. Зеленский знай Армяне первыми поздравят Русских с Победой над тобой и над твоими идиотами!!!
I’m hoping England don’t get involved we don’t need to do just let Russia do what they’ve got to do
Why every war start by USA ....
You fuckheads from england, france, germany and the US have brought this about! Your constant war mongering is like a cancer to the planet. Wherever your politicians go, there is destruction, whatever they say it is all lies!
What the f.
LET'SGOBRANDON.............
This is a nightmare. 😪
This is what the terrorists encounter in Gaza every year, with the support of the majority of countries in the world, with America at its head
As a American I can say I’m willing to fight on the front line with Ukrainian for there freedom for their kids for their family’s safety
stay strong Ukraine!! All these innocent people will die just because of Russia's self leader
This is horrible, I hope the NATO Nations will send troops over and help the Ukrainians with peace and freedom much love from Canada  stay safe my prayer are with you all.
Denazification???... Their democratically elected president, Zelensky, is Jewish. And Putin is saying that Ukraine needs Denazification? That's a reach, even for Putin!
we`ve been there ,&done that = 1939 ! 1950 ! and we were not prepared ,same now , never learn !!
They are so incredibly upset that people are shooting bombs at them. Humanity as a whole needs to be aware of Russia and Russian affairs like this is one world. Without violence,without negligence,  without fail.
All my support to the civilians
If this Is real how come the reporters are not worried considering flights are suspended
By the wy. So called journalists, you are a shame! You are not reporting the news or the truth. You are a propaganda machine, nothing more.
A month ago the world war III was a meme. Now it's reality.
Putin is pure evil
SHOCK AND AWE RUSSIAN STYLE. Western government's sit down, shut up and stand by.
Want somebody put a billion dollar bounty on pooping ,,,,,Putin 🤔.... This is just the beginning of the end of the Russian federation remember what you put out in the universe you should get back from the universe...
RIP to all lost soul I hope Ukraine stay strong 🇺🇦🇹🇳
Just imagine the agony and suffering of Iraqis , Syrians and Palestinians have gone throughout the years. No one really cared just because they were muslim countries and muslims died now that Ukraine is at war and Christians are dying the whole world is at notice. Such a shame how biased people in this world are. There should be peace all around the world or just an all out war! This two faced nature and biasing is just not acceptable. And yeah good luck stopping Putin , you just can't!!
Let's all attack Russia we could do with a world reset
Now Moscow has stick a wrecked thermonuclear plant in the Europe's rear end. It's called 
Can we  fix it with a bottle of vodka and a freindly  game of chess.
What's so Great about this Country? With all the crap we have to face worry where you live.
Vlad Putin has just started WW III.  The European appeasers will next move to a financial attack and a political isolation.
How does anyone really know if this is real. Like 9/11 was deemed real and building 5 fell demolition style without even being struck by a plane.
FUCK RUSSIA.
Always money for weapons of destruction, RIP those lost. So sad that after Covid the world enters madness again.
I just hope if they do use nukes, they use enough to kill us all.
Oh my god this is terrible, i feel super sorry for the people Who have died or got injured, i hope world war lll wont start it Will be terrible and a lot of people Would die, Putin is a evil man, he just wants power and doesnt think about the people getting atacked
We whole world now fighting against  Covid for save human being. Whereas, it's shame for us that in this situation now we are under war.Whatever right or wrong, must stop war.
F you BBC !
I'm 12 And I now know I will probably die by 2030 with all of that pollution that it let off Just unbelievable
Misles in Ukraine is a major threat to Russia no argument about that.NATO orchestrated and the west got their wish.Money money money 💸💸💸💸💸💸💸Got little white girls with signs of save Ukraine and a black reporter to counter neonazi claims.
Evryone caredThat's why they were given refuge in Europe while their Arab brothers left them alone To this day Palestinians are welcomed in 12 latin american nations ( Christian) Syrians and Iraqis went to Europe on massive amount and receive free welfare
 @DOOMER  Lol!!  why do that to them in the first place. So you're saying,  them leaving their homeland to take refuge some place else is a good thing? You're basically saying yeah butcher them all you want and when that's done we'll take them in. You need to get your facts right. You can't kill someone's whole family and let the survivors get free welfare and call that a good deed. All of this should should not happen in the first place! be it any country or any race or any religion. this is just cruel and inhumane!
 @StraightouttaKashmir  noThey started revolting against their own leaderSyria- protests against AssadLybia- al Qaeda kills Gaddafi Yemen-Saudi Iran proxy war and both are Muslim nationsAfghanistan- the exiled goverment asks for help from us and us invadesNow i don't know what America is nato did in these countries, but these are the justifications.
It's Started, OMG 😱
putin waited for a stupid US president, well thank you Biden for removing the US army in afganistan, else Putin wouldnt attack, he else get a 2 siden counter attack ..
Play don't worry by hakim sasha....
There’s going to be Terrorist attackes on Moscow soon and the west will be somewhat silent
Okay, Hitler.
NExt war is Taiwan  .. if the USA or nato don’t do something about this one . We need a strong leader .. not a fragile old shell sleepy joe
My message to putin is to mind hiss own buisnes
Am tired of hearing war everywhere, when will this bloodshed end? My country Ethiopia is also fighting with rebels within. Egypt is threatening to open war with us because of the Nile dam .what is happening? Why can't we live in peace?why?  My heart goes to the innocent civillians😪😪
So much for “demilitarization” Putin.
The big threat from Ukraine is that they are a functioning democracy. Putin wants everyone to believe such a thing is impossible. He also doesn't want anyone in Russia getting ideas.
NATO will not help because UKRAINE IS NOT A NATO MEMBER.Ukraine tried to become a nato member and this is the result.Ukraine was warned and they ignored the warnings.
Ukraines fault,,they should been more prepared...anti tank mines should have been set, strategy,etc
Putin must be stopped.
Why are we showing “unverified images”? Stick to what’s verified!
Wow Putin lied!? I never seen that coming he’s always been such an honest guy
🇷🇺🇷🇸💪
western are brook they don't have money to keep up with Afghanistan how come to fight against Russia. Its better for the US to not waste the TAX money on destabilizing other countries like Russia because its not Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq.
There’s still evil men in the world 🌎
This is what happens when you put a spineless pussy in the presidency of the United states it causes bullys to grow bigger balls
Lier lier pants on fire
This is horrible...all because of a bully ...this is not tolerable...
my heart goes out to the ukranians
Russia want take over to expand not the country but their army
News reporter called Putin the grimlin😂😂
Why are u all shocked literally us intelligence told you he was gunna do it
Putin is a murderer
Biden and Putin are a mad men...!
Finally BBC your reporting real news again!
Это видео показывает враньё! На самом деле мирные дома не тронуты русскими. Где дома горят это украинцы Донбасс обстреляли.
This is like watching a wolf hunt sheep. Its not cool. Ukraine is waiting for the Shepard to show up, but the Shepard has more sheep to worry about. These sheep need to attack these wolves back somehow. Whatever it is we will call it the Ukrainian buffalo jump
God bless Romania & Ucraina
Rip to the civilians. Why not these presidents arm wrestle eachother and decide the winner at once. One on one battle is better than putting many innocent lives at risk
0:36 gave me chills. To see Russia back at its old ways after so long.
They will be the cause for a nuclear war
It shouldn't be a surprise...Georgia, Crimea, and now the Ukraine.
Just like China, Turkey and Russia… when the leaders are Dictators … the outcome is never good at the end for the people!!!!
Fascist  Ukraine seems no problem for BBC!Shame on you guys!
Fuck Russia tho
🇺🇦 fuck putlerWar crimes zero
Why Russia attacking Ukraine why😐 we are human beings we all must be one people they must stop this war 😐
Znato zelinski boris and biden the arsonists
This is terrible. Cannot imagine what those people went through daily in places like Syria and Donbass because the mainstream media never truly reported those. Poor civilians.
Long live Russia 🇷🇺
Putalin and Xitler's Evil deeds must be punished. 😡😡😡😡
Vote for bjp ad for indians
Sorry 😭😭
Biden and Putin are evil and should be taken to international criminal court to face trial, weak evil and a political satanists...!
Imagine how palestine is suffering and for so many years and the world is quite🥺
I am so sorry this is happening. I pray for the Ukrainian people. The border of my country, Poland, is open to Ukrainian people, so anyone who is able can make their way over here, and we will look after you. Our border is currently able to process around 50,000 people per day.
🤣🤣🤣😭
I call people of Ukraine to remove your mad president from power
sad
One man's greed and quest for conquest. Such a monstrous individual.
Exactly. The occupation of the golan heights and the west Bank was illegal whilst America and Britain supported it. The hypocrisy from the west is fascinating.
Who Biden? Or Putin who doesn’t want to end up like Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Libya…and trying to defend Russia against an American massacre
Please help Ukraine agains Russian power... keep safe
‘An airport’ - BBC ‘A military airport’ - everyone else.
This are the last days, the age of Laodicea. My heart goes to the civilians, may the Lord God protect the civilians
Kamala will take control of this soon
Why does the Russian despot even want to destroy this nation?
I know it's not the right time but 1:10  antivirus software sound is undeniable.
Question is, will he stop here!
Middle East doesn't get this BBC attention does anyone know why.
1:01 was no kharkov it was donetsk those buildings got bombed by Ukraine forces not russians
War against west!
BBC давненько потеряли авторитет
Goebbells is alive, he just has a new persona.
Ukraine  dig in and stand your ground
War is worthless
God please help the people of this world
Dont worry guys this is just a military operation
Is the US stepping in ?
Russia is showing how bully a nation they are. The world doesnt a war like this. Fck it
Rev 12.
Beijing Biden did this. I'm sorry, but he did, the sob can't govern for sh*t. He saw the loser's pathetic excuse for a 
This guy has lost his mind what exactly is he trying to accomplish bless y’all citizens in Ukraine stay safe <3!
If fast, they will conquer the country in a few weeks.
I thought Putin was a good guy
By the time he finds a gun it will be over
War in….full HD
Lets hope Ukraine makes it too costly to keep this up.
Biden is the cause.
Putin killing children and adults..so sad?

Stay safe everyone
somehow the news dont show the whole picture this is all one sided, who ever believes that nato is defensive is an idiot
where were you guys when NATO invaded and destroyed dozens of Muslim countries.
Putin=Hitler2.0
What does the Jewish community think of the US supporting Neo-Nazis? We all know what the Nazi Ukranians did in the camps.
Russia is only doing this because they know Ukraine wont strike back. This is an act of war though and Ukraine needs to respond appropriately. Ukraine needs to try to take additional land or strike back on Russia civilians like the Russians are killing Ukraine civilians. Russia is playing chess and Ukraine was left with checkers. Ukraine needs to start playing chess to win this. Otherwise Ukraine will fall and the Ukrainians will be oppressed again unfortuantely.
Putin  same as a Hitter
I hate communists!
Prayers from India 🇮🇳
What does that have to do with anything?
 @KodeKraft RC  This situation speaks for itself my friend.
Now, everyone is going to hate Russians.
Damn, I wish nato would engage Russia.
Here we go again. Although. This might not take 5 years.
Stop war 🕊️🕊️
Ukraine 🇺🇦 fight for your homes don't let Russia win this war so easy. I know your strong and united I pray for all your children and people who can't fight to get out asp. Let your army fight they can win this I know it.
So sad 🥺 new war
Omg it starts . Pls stop!
my god 🤔🤔from tanzania
Very horrific ! Really devastated praying for the citizens ! Putin is a assole 🤦‍♂️
Putin is new Hitler.
This is the end of deep state and cabal
I don’t get it how Russian soldiers can fire on their Ukrainian friends…
What about palestine
WORLD WAR 3!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Cover the blood on innocent civilians
I wish the western powers n it’s people felt the way they feel now when they invaded Iraq n Libya. Was it justifiable that so many lives were lost bcs of so called threat to them n when Putin deals with Russia’s threats is a problem??? Double standard n selfish.
so he is just bashing fash, he must be Antifa
Just goes to show how clever use of photography can make a situation look much worse. As for the Ukraine president, i heard that he, along with other members of the government, had fled to safety in Poland within a couple of hours of the Russian attack
What a shitty world. As if we had not enough problems alteady. Putin is a joke and an embarrassment for its country and people. No one wants a war!
Fuck Russia and there mothers
Still not enough tho , what is the number of people putin killed till now ?? 1 thousand or more those are rookie numbers in this business. Putin gotta pump those up if he wishes to go against Hitler's legacy
In war there are no friends
 @Kabita Kar  I would bet that they don’t want fight Ukrainian, they fear Putin regime. Nobody blamed or criticized Russia in WW2 and they did horrible things the difference was they were fighting for peace, in this case they are in the wrong side …
Putin gone crazy
New war 🥺
I can only imagine how horrified those poor people are- imagine the young kids who are living there. I’m praying for Ukraine and hoping all will be good 🙏
We need to go
Mr. Putin what threats are you referring to? You are the threat! Give peace a chance! Ceasefire must be declared!
You would think 8 years of ethnic cleansing by the monsters would be enough outrage.
Fuck KGB Putin Ass hole
I applaud all Ukrainian citizens for being strong and maintaining such stark morale!!! The West believes in you Ukraine!!!! You will not fight this war alone.
If Israel do it its ok but Russia do it its headline news
whY you Smarty sneaky corrupt clown zelinsky stealing 1000km × 700km country from UDSSR for slightly population funny 10 Milion Ukraine people. Why ⁉️. You want to sell gas in first hand Why are others mixed in corruption in Ukraine and others why ⁉️
My god, protect the people of Ukraine 🇺🇦🙏 the world wants PEACE not WAR🥺
That sound of the missile flying over head is like nails on a chalkboard. Supremely unsettling and terrifying. Artillery and bombing will claim a high percent of casualties. So sad that a tyrant can sit in his castle and lob death and destruction from his hideaway
Putin Rusland Hitler
God bless them they won’t get any help off NATO or anyone else talk is cheap’ shame on the world for letting this happen
This seems to be Putins idea,not Russias 🇷🇺
Putin has ruined Russia. Ukraine will recover, build itself up again and Putin will be tiny as a mouse in a few years.
.. and you'd think we're more modern than attacking each other like savages.
The poor has never wanted a war its the shirts and ties at the top. Let them fight there own personal wars with there blood being spilt
WTF!Not even in Mexico DrugCartels start bombing cities just because…Didn’t think this could happen in the XXI century.The free world needs to stop this not only for the Ukrainian people, but also to set a hard stop on anyone else thinking on trying this in the future.
To bad praying doesn't do shit.
It is the shame that we can't do anything against Russian aggression. I am from Kazakhstan. With Ukraine, we share similar history (famines, repressions, genocide by USSR) and current problems because of Russia. Ukraine does not deserve such cruelty! I hope the Russian aggression will be stopped!It is the shame that my country would not dare to help Ukraine because they scarred of Russia. But our people really worried and always support Ukraine. Жыве Украïна! Қазақтар сізбен бірге🇰🇿🇺🇦🇰🇿🇺🇦
just as bad as living in the U.S, the federal government should of let trump control it @ least the tax money would have stayed where it belonged, they went in without any defense except Ukraine, just like in Afghanistan Taliban took it over with ease just as Russia will take over Ukraine
 @Norm Hiscock  it gives people hope and that’s enough for me, whether god is real or not.
believe me, this is a propaganda video, they didn’t even translate Putin correctly, and they will never post the full speech at all, because he told the truth there about Western interventions in other countries
No , you can never imagine the horrors of war if you were never in one . I can't either .
@Марина Марина  You, Russian people, don't even listen...Зачем вторгаться на чужие территории? Путин - агрессор! На старости лет уже с ума выжил
 @Марина Марина  believe me some of us do speak Russian too. F*ck off
 @Марина Марина  Would you elaborate? What did Putin actually say then?
These are FAKE MASONIC NEWS. As usual. These are Ukrainian forces attacking Donetsk and Lugansk (containing over 80% russuan population) because those republic declared themselfs independent, and Russia recongnised their infependece, Ukraine believing in possible future steps of those 2 republics go over to Russia, thus Ukraine see this as a Ulrainian teritory steing by Russia. Un short, these are Ukrainan attacks within those 2 rebels republics, considered by Ukraine as

 @Norm Hiscock  too bad that telling him praying doesn’t do shit, doesn’t do shit
 @dan ploesteanu  уважаемый, как вы из психушку сбежали?
 @Heosphoros  and that's problem instead of relying do somethjng about it.
 @avocado  it is better to find the text so that you understand exactly what he says, I will try to search for you.here it is torn out of speech and translated incorrectly, but Zelensky’s speech was painted with the necessary colors for anti-Russian propaganda
 @avocado  Dear citizens of Russia! Dear friends!Today, I again consider it necessary to return to the tragic events taking place in the Donbass and the key issues of ensuring the security of Russia itself.Let me start with what I said in my address of February 21 this year. We are talking about what causes us particular concern and anxiety, about those fundamental threats that year after year, step by step, are rudely and unceremoniously created by irresponsible politicians in the West in relation to our country. I mean the expansion of the NATO bloc to the east, bringing its military infrastructure closer to Russian borders.It is well known that for 30 years we have persistently and patiently tried to reach an agreement with the leading NATO countries on the principles of equal and indivisible security in Europe. In response to our proposals, we were constantly faced with either cynical deceit and lies, or attempts at pressure and blackmail, while the North Atlantic Alliance, in the meantime, despite all our protests and concerns, is steadily expanding. The military machine is moving and, I repeat, is coming close to our borders.
Why is all this happening? Where does this impudent manner of speaking from the position of one's own exclusivity, infallibility and permissiveness come from? Where does the disdainful, disdainful attitude towards our interests and absolutely legitimate demands come from?The answer is clear, everything is clear and obvious. The Soviet Union in the late 80s of the last century weakened, then simply collapsed. The whole course of events that took place then is a good lesson for us today as well; it convincingly showed that the paralysis of power and will is the first step towards complete degradation and oblivion. As soon as we lost confidence in ourselves for some time, and that’s it, the balance of power in the world turned out to be disturbed.This has led to the fact that the previous treaties and agreements are no longer in effect. Persuasion and requests do not help. Everything that does not suit the hegemon, those in power, is declared archaic, obsolete, unnecessary. And vice versa: everything that seems beneficial to them is presented as the ultimate truth, pushed through at any cost, boorishly, by all means. Dissenters are broken through the knee.What I am talking about now concerns not only Russia and not only us. This applies to the entire system of international relations, and sometimes even to the US allies themselves. After the collapse of the USSR, the redivision of the world actually began, and the norms of international law that had developed by that time - and the key, basic ones were adopted at the end of the Second World War and largely consolidated its results - began to interfere with those who declared themselves the winner in the

A similar fate was prepared for Syria. The fighting of the Western coalition on the territory of this country without the consent of the Syrian government and the sanction of the UN Security Council is nothing but aggression, intervention.However, a special place in this series is occupied, of course, by the invasion of Iraq, also without any legal grounds. As a pretext, they chose reliable information allegedly available to the United States about the presence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. As proof of this, publicly, in front of the eyes of the whole world, the US Secretary of State shook some kind of test tube with white powder, assuring everyone that this is the chemical weapon being developed in Iraq. And then it turned out that all this was a hoax, a bluff: there are no chemical weapons in Iraq. Unbelievable, surprising, but the fact remains. There were lies at the highest state level and from the high rostrum of the UN. And as a result - huge casualties, destruction, an incredible surge of terrorism.In general, one gets the impression that practically everywhere, in many regions of the world, where the United States comes to establish its own order, as a result, there are bloody, non-healing wounds, ulcers of international terrorism and extremism. All that I have said is the most egregious, but by no means the only examples of disregard for international law.In this series, and promises to our country not to expand NATO by one inch to the east. I repeat - they deceived me, but in popular terms, they simply threw it away. Yes, you can often hear that politics is a dirty business. Perhaps, but not to the same extent, not to the same extent. After all, such cheating behavior contradicts not only the principles of international relations, but above all the generally recognized norms of morality and morality. Where is justice and truth here? Just a bunch of lies and hypocrisy.
By the way, American politicians, political scientists and journalists themselves write and talk about the fact that a real 
 @dan ploesteanu  you are fake. People are dying. Ukrainian forces do not attack their own territories. They attack only russian terrorists and fight back to take what is ours.
Despite everything, in December 2021, we nevertheless once again made an attempt to agree with the United States and its allies on the principles of ensuring security in Europe and on the non-expansion of NATO. Everything is in vain. The US position does not change. They do not consider it necessary to negotiate with Russia on this key issue for us, pursuing their own goals, they neglect our interests.And of course, in this situation, we have a question: what to do next, what to expect? We know well from history how in the 1940s and early 1941s the Soviet Union tried in every possible way to prevent or at least delay the outbreak of war. To this end, among other things, he tried literally to the last not to provoke a potential aggressor, did not carry out or postponed the most necessary, obvious actions to prepare for repelling an inevitable attack. And those steps that were nevertheless taken in the end were catastrophically belated.As a result, the country was not ready to fully meet the invasion of Nazi Germany, which attacked our Motherland on June 22, 1941 without declaring war. The enemy was stopped and then crushed, but at a colossal cost. An attempt to appease the aggressor on the eve of the Great Patriotic War turned out to be a mistake that cost our people dearly. In the very first months of hostilities, we lost huge, strategically important territories and millions of people. The second time we will not allow such a mistake, we have no right.
Those who claim world domination, publicly, with impunity and, I emphasize, without any reason, declare us, Russia, their enemy. Indeed, today they have great financial, scientific, technological and military capabilities. We are aware of this and objectively assess the threats constantly being addressed to us in the economic sphere, as well as our ability to resist this impudent and permanent blackmail. I repeat, we evaluate them without illusions, extremely realistically.As for the military sphere, modern Russia, even after the collapse of the USSR and the loss of a significant part of its potential, is today one of the most powerful nuclear powers in the world and, moreover, has certain advantages in a number of the latest types of weapons. In this regard, no one should have any doubts that a direct attack on our country will lead to defeat and dire consequences for any potential aggressor.At the same time, technologies, including defense technologies, are changing rapidly. Leadership in this area is passing and will continue to change hands, but the military development of the territories adjacent to our borders, if we allow it, will remain for decades to come, and maybe forever, and will create an ever-growing, absolutely unacceptable threat for Russia. .Even now, as NATO expands to the east, the situation for our country is getting worse and more dangerous every year. Moreover, in recent days, the NATO leadership has been openly talking about the need to speed up the advancement of the alliance's infrastructure to Russia's borders. In other words, they are hardening their position. We can no longer just continue to observe what is happening. It would be absolutely irresponsible on our part.
Further expansion of the infrastructure of the North Atlantic Alliance, the military development of the territories of Ukraine that has begun is unacceptable for us. The point, of course, is not the NATO organization itself - it is only an instrument of US foreign policy. The problem is that in the territories adjacent to us, I will note, in our own historical territories, an “anti-Russia” hostile to us is being created, which has been placed under complete external control, is intensively settled by the armed forces of NATO countries and is pumped up with the most modern weapons.For the United States and its allies, this is the so-called policy of containment of Russia, obvious geopolitical dividends. And for our country, this is ultimately a matter of life and death, a matter of our historical future as a people. And this is not an exaggeration - it is true. This is a real threat not just to our interests, but to the very existence of our state, its sovereignty. This is the very red line that has been talked about many times. They passed her.In this regard, and about the situation in the Donbass. We see that the forces that carried out a coup d'etat in Ukraine in 2014, seized power and are holding it with the help of, in fact, decorative electoral procedures, have finally abandoned the peaceful settlement of the conflict. For eight years, endlessly long eight years, we have done everything possible to resolve the situation by peaceful, political means. All in vain.As I said in my previous address, one cannot look at what is happening there without compassion. It was simply impossible to endure all this. It was necessary to immediately stop this nightmare - the genocide against the millions of people living there, who rely only on Russia, hope only on us. It was these aspirations, feelings, pain of people that were for us the main motive for making a decision to recognize the people's republics of Donbass.
What I think is important to emphasize further. The leading NATO countries, in order to achieve their own goals, support extreme nationalists and neo-Nazis in Ukraine in everything, who, in turn, will never forgive the Crimeans and Sevastopol residents for their free choice - reunification with Russia.They, of course, will climb into the Crimea, and just like in the Donbass, with a war, in order to kill, as punishers from the gangs of Ukrainian nationalists, Hitler's accomplices, killed defenseless people during the Great Patriotic War. They openly declare that they lay claim to a number of other Russian territories.The entire course of events and analysis of incoming information shows that Russia's clash with these forces is inevitable. It is only a matter of time: they are getting ready, they are waiting for the right time. Now they also claim to possess nuclear weapons. We will not allow this to be done.As I said earlier, after the collapse of the USSR, Russia accepted new geopolitical realities. We respect and will continue to treat all the newly formed countries in the post-Soviet space with respect. We respect and will continue to respect their sovereignty, and an example of this is the assistance we provided to Kazakhstan, which faced tragic events, with a challenge to its statehood and integrity. But Russia cannot feel safe, develop, exist with a constant threat emanating from the territory of modern Ukraine.
А вы многое знаете  про этих бедных людях?Вам ведь никогда не расскажут, как в мае 2014г. в Одессе ,в 
Let me remind you that in 2000-2005 we gave a military rebuff to terrorists in the Caucasus, defended the integrity of our state, saved Russia. In 2014, they supported the Crimeans and Sevastopol residents. In 2015, the Armed Forces used to put a reliable barrier to the penetration of terrorists from Syria into Russia. We had no other way to protect ourselves.The same thing is happening now. You and I simply have not been left with any other opportunity to protect Russia, our people, except for the one that we will be forced to use today. Circumstances require us to take decisive and immediate action. The people's republics of Donbass turned to Russia with a request for help.In this regard, in accordance with Article 51 of Part 7 of the UN Charter, with the sanction of the Federation Council of Russia and in pursuance of the treaties of friendship and mutual assistance ratified by the Federal Assembly on February 22 this year with the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic, I decided to conduct a special military operation .Its goal is to protect people who have been subjected to bullying and genocide by the Kiev regime for eight years. And for this we will strive for the demilitarization and denazification of Ukraine, as well as bringing to justice those who committed numerous, bloody crimes against civilians, including citizens of the Russian Federation.
At the same time, our plans do not include the occupation of Ukrainian territories. We are not going to impose anything on anyone by force. At the same time, we hear that recently in the West there are more and more words that the documents signed by the Soviet totalitarian regime, which consolidate the results of the Second World War, should no longer be carried out. Well, what is the answer to this?The results of the Second World War, as well as the sacrifices made by our people on the altar of victory over Nazism, are sacred. But this does not contradict the high values ​​of human rights and freedoms, based on the realities that have developed today over all the post-war decades. It also does not cancel the right of nations to self-determination, enshrined in Article 1 of the UN Charter.Let me remind you that neither during the creation of the USSR, nor after the Second World War, people living in certain territories that are part of modern Ukraine, no one ever asked how they themselves want to arrange their lives. Our policy is based on freedom, the freedom of choice for everyone to independently determine their own future and the future of their children. And we consider it important that this right - the right to choose - could be used by all the peoples living on the territory of today's Ukraine, by everyone who wants it.In this regard, I appeal to the citizens of Ukraine. In 2014, Russia was obliged to protect the inhabitants of Crimea and Sevastopol from those whom you yourself call 
Today's events are not connected with the desire to infringe on the interests of Ukraine and the Ukrainian people. They are connected with the protection of Russia itself from those who took Ukraine hostage and are trying to use it against our country and its people.I repeat, our actions are self-defense against the threats posed to us and from an even greater disaster than what is happening today. No matter how difficult it may be, I ask you to understand this and call for cooperation in order to turn this tragic page as soon as possible and move forward together, not to allow anyone to interfere in our affairs, in our relations, but to build them on our own, so that it creates the necessary conditions for overcoming all problems and, despite the presence of state borders, would strengthen us from the inside as a whole. I believe in this - in this is our future.I should also appeal to the military personnel of the armed forces of Ukraine.Dear comrades! Your fathers, grandfathers, great-grandfathers did not fight the Nazis, defending our common Motherland, so that today's neo-Nazis seized power in Ukraine. You took an oath of allegiance to the Ukrainian people, and not to the anti-people junta that plunders Ukraine and mocks these same people.Don't follow her criminal orders. I urge you to lay down your weapons immediately and go home. Let me explain: all servicemen of the Ukrainian army who fulfill this requirement will be able to freely leave the combat zone and return to their families.Once again, I insistently emphasize: all responsibility for possible bloodshed will be entirely on the conscience of the regime ruling on the territory of Ukraine.
Now a few important, very important words for those who may be tempted to intervene in ongoing events. Whoever tries to hinder us, and even more so to create threats for our country, for our people, should know that Russia's response will be immediate and will lead you to consequences that you have never experienced in your history. We are ready for any development of events. All necessary decisions in this regard have been made. I hope that I will be heard.Dear citizens of Russia!Well-being, the very existence of entire states and peoples, their success and viability always originate in the powerful root system of their culture and values, experience and traditions of their ancestors and, of course, directly depend on the ability to quickly adapt to a constantly changing life, on the cohesion of society, its readiness to consolidate, to gather together all the forces in order to move forward.Forces are needed always - always, but strength can be of different quality. The policy of the 
 @avocado  I translated his speech to you directly in Google, sorry, a lot, but if you are interested, read it.I looked at the English translations, they are done differently. So I think you might be interested in the real speech if you want to have your own opinion on the subject
In God i trust. Everything will be alright am sure
 @Марина Марина  lady, Soviet union started 2 world war together with Hitler. Soviet union attacked Poland in 1939 and made parade together with Hitler when they occupied it. There is an old video of it! You are living in another worldeverything you said is fake completelyread historyputin is a liar
 @Марина Марина  sorry, you write too much. No time to read. Just leave Ukraine alone. Just do not look at my country. Just forget it. Do not look left, look right
 @Akiyoshi Saitō  you've never been interested in modern history, that's why you ask such stupid questions.I am Ukrainian on one passport, plus two more
 @Sasha Shall  я белив, и что из этого?
 @Lena cy  NO, you don't know or you're lying.  My friend's mother lives in Gorlovka, she told us that there are guns on the territory of Ukraine, near the line of contact. First, they shoot towards the Donbass, then they turn their guns 180 degrees and shoot at the territory of Ukraine.This is where the stories come from that the Russians from the Donbass are shelling Ukraine.
 @Александра Нестерова  не знала я про эту аллею.. сегодня ведь день кожа дыбов.. то люди донбасса рассказывают что было там, успокаивают украинцев, которым сейчас страшно, учат как выжить при бомбежке и эта аллея. Гореть зеленскому и порошенко и иже с ними в аду.. просто НЕЛЮДИ могли такое допустить. пшут что зеленскому миллиард выдали, видимо он его и держит у кресла, или обещают подмогу.Мне интересно, он сам выйдет навстречу, или убежит, или вытащат из под стола
 @Марина Марина  kid no shit charloc imagine supporting Putin after what he has done
 @Марина Марина  may god bless Ukraine 🇺🇦 love from Switzerland 🇨🇭
 @Lena cy  I know this, nevertheless, after the war, Stalin gave part of the German lands to Poland.what did I say wrong? that in Odessa on May 2, 14, the modern government of Ukraine burned living people? the police stood and watched as the Nazis shot people who were trying to jump out of the burning building. How the children miraculously managed to escape through the roof of the building, because the doors were closed, smoke bombs with poison gas were launched inside. How Ukrainian Nazis doused a pregnant woman with gasoline and set her on fire.How no one called the fire brigade, which was located 500 meters from the house of trade unions, and allowed living people to burn down in front of the soulless observers of the Nazis and the police.THESE people came to power in Ukraine, and they rule it, they also dealt with the people of the Donbass. Wait, I'll find you what the Donbasian writes
 @Lena cy  this is now being written by a man who survived 8 years of war in Donetsk, calming the frightened Ukrainians. ,,, Home is my castle. At my age, I will no longer build housing. I worked in a mine to earn money for my housing. Here are the graves of my father, my sister and other relatives. My mother is 85 years old. This is my piece of land. Therefore, most people did not leave and will not leave now. Was it scary? It was. For children, for housing. Remained. Then they got used to it.The first day of the war we had in general tin. Also a fight at the airport, also helicopters, fighter jets and people without heads, without legs and generally to shreds! They just lay on the pavement along the road. A woman with a piece of her head on her body... ThenKamAZ with arms, legs and heads, they were simply thrown in parts into the body, and blood was pouring from it like a bucket. It was creepy. The taxi driver, who had been shot, lay for a long time and people were still lying on the pavement, but they were shooting from the airport, they were not allowed to pick up people. New dead... There are corpses in the field. And this is the heat. Human remains swelled in the sun, an incredible smell stood around the airport. But it was impossible to approach him even close, they were shooting. Rats and dogs from the landing ate the corpses.It is not possible to convey. It's all there on the Internet.I remember how they said not to go out onto the balconies and leave the windows. And I heard the sound of a helicopter right at the level of the balcony. And ran out. I did not think that I would even meet the eyes of the pilot. And he could also shoot at me, thinking that I was armed. I saw him, he saw me. Then this turntable went towards Slavyansk. Later it was reported that one turntable was shot down. Maybe this pilot got it. Three helicopters went there. This was already, approximately, on the 2nd or 3rd day of the war. Although, probably later.We did not believe that they would shoot at us.Then came the technology. People stood in front of the tanks and blocked their way with their bodies. At first it helped, but then they began to shoot at people or crush them with a tank. It was all unbelievable. Everyone thought that people would come to their senses ... But 8 years have already passed. Later, artillery appeared, Grads, Hurricanes, Peonies Cornflowers, Hyacinths, even point U flew in.Politicians are fighting. The people don't want war. If the children of politicians were put in one trench on the front line, then the war would stop instantly.
 @Lena cy  а я не вам писала совсем, не читайте, зачем вам. у меня направо англ база с аэродромом, зачем мне туда сомтреть?
 @Марина Марина  в том то и  дело,что в других странах об этом умалчивают и люди всерьёз считают Украину жертвой России.Про Зеленского вроде говорят сбежал из страны,но это не достоверно.Не знаю где он ,но сегодня вышло его обращение к россиянам,просит устраивать митинги с требованием прекращения войны.
 @TheUnknownFan  what did he do today?Americans bombed Yugoslavia by carpet bombing, destroying bridges and infrastructure. Not thinking about how people will live later.The Russians are conducting a military operation to destroy military facilities on the territory of Ukraine and that's it. Everything else is kept safe and sound for people. for the countryJapan was disarmed after Pearl Harbor, Putin just didn’t want it to happen in Russia, history is a useful thing, you can learn from the mistakes of others.
 @TheUnknownFan  of course, God was thinking about Ukraine, sending her Putin, who will free her from the Nazis
 @Марина Марина  good night and good dreams about Putin lying down on your face.
 @Марина Марина  marina i will give shit on your grave when shit of piece called russian federation will be destroed by sactions. You will eat trashes from bin beacause ur economy died. Very sad.
look what I found .. ukraine was going to be the first to attack russia, ha ha a hundred timesr,,,Ukrainian Soldiers Are Preparing for Russia to Invade (Again),,get it on youtube  I wonder if they attacked Russia first, would you feel sorry for the Russians and pray for them? Zelensky is still a fool, he ruffled his tongue a lot
 @Марина Марина  how do u feel with 20% of inflation on 2 days?
 @Марина Марина  what did putin said actually ?
 @AXZENO  prove it? Lol
 @Александра Нестерова  я видела часть.. его выступление. Идиот .Нашла случайно видео, зеленский оказывается в январе собирался нападать на россию ,,rUkrainian Soldiers Are Preparing for Russia to Invade (Again),,Все думаю, пугал пугал, и что счас. Путин все таки великий стратег, конечно не нравится мне в нем некотоыре вещи, но некоторые просто поражают.как аккуратно бомбят, а украинцы орут, как будто их ковровыми бомбежками кроют. Жители донбасса их успокаиваеют, рассказывают как прятатся от бомбежек, как слышать и распозновать свист ракет.. к тебе летит или от тебя. Это ужасно, как будто я читаю воспоминания ветеранов второй мировой, отечественной, а это было рядом с нами, в наше время, с таким же людьми как мы.Один мужчина описывал бойню возле аэропорта, в подробгостях, в донецке, страшно читать, а украинцы в это время ,,хорошо жили,, никто не ходил на демонстрации, все было тепло и удобно. Аллея ангелов меня потрясла, я только сегодня о ней узнала... и это в стране цивилизованной? европейской?
 @Evan Harkey  prove that god exists?
 @Марина Марина  Go back to your troll farm handler and say that you have failed - again!
Because what? Nobody is sending troops or forces, so it's worth fuck all. The West believes, my ass!
now the question comes, are you willing to join the Ukraine army to help them fight the Russian troop? If not, then shut up. Stop behaving like a hypocrite
I find that stupid. If your country is getting invaded by one that has nuclear weapons and is quite strong for you,it's dumb to stay there. I care about my life a bit more than my country,I wouldn't risk my life just to look 
Thats all you bruh.
They will fight this war alone unless you want ww3. It won’t be much of a war, Russia has crippled them already.
Pretty sure fewer civilians will die here than they did in Afghanistan.
 @Terry Bridge  not if it lasts 20 years like Afghanistan
How people didn't see this coming is mind numbing. People where warned to get out. It's heartbreaking.
God is watching. Putin should go to hell!🤬
Please don't do the war
Snarlingly? Fuck the bbc
Nobel Peace Committee are you seeing this?? This is what happens when you give Peace prize to a politician. Now Mr. Putin wants to show to the world who is the actual keeper of peace or on whose shoulders the peace lies safely in Europe. May be you should consider giving Mr. Putin a peace prize. Or a joint peace prize to Mr. Biden and Mr. Putin but that will surely bring Mr. Trump into picture and you should answer him as to why he should not be given the peace prize. So committee, in view of so many families being affected you should revise your policies...I wonder if a prize return from his rival politician will satisfy Mr. Putin's ego...
Bless all people in Ukrain
Don't Worry We have 164 countries on our Side
I hope the war will end soon.
I'm not into political stuff or whatever, But can't other NATO countries intervene & help UKRAINE???
What a SHAME !BBC side With FASCIST UKRAINE! Winston Churchill must be spinning in his grave!!!
The Ukraine is gone, Biden and to be fair, European nations allowed it, because Europe is too dependent on Russia for its energy, instead of making windmills you should’ve been building nuclear power plants
OMG 😔😢🙏😢😢🙏🙏
where is sanity?
Putin is willing to kill thousand just to make himself popular again to his people... its a strategy when your popularity is going down create an enemy and fight a war you create...
USA SHOULD STEP IN. SHELL RUSSIA. BIDEN GROW SOME BALLS. YOU MAKING USA LOOK LIKE PUSSIES. FUCK PUTIN
Putin for president
Wtf why is putin doing this?
I was about to sleep when all of a sudden I saw on Putin's speech on tv. Didn't think much about. Finished wrapping up my day and went to turn off the tele when Russia began their invasion. I had a lovely sleep... My heart goes out to the Ukranians waking up to sirens everywhere.
The world leaders who are shedding some crocodile tears for Nazi Ukraine, are secretly glad that Putin went through with his threats. And their 
Putin is the New Adolf Hitler
Yes yes yes yes yes
When war breaks out its always the innocent who suffer the most.
Ukraine wanted to join nato.  Where the hell are you nato?
it baffels me that your governments allow death and destruction above rational decisions. Why destroy everything?
They will burn in Hell all the war mongers!!!
Did you think of civilians when NATO 1999. ATTACKED Serbia with bomb contains radioactive uranium!!!!! Shame on toxic politic of USA, and countries of West civilization.
Etne dinse wo chup tha tu udta gaya or Russia pe hi nuclear bomb ki sochne luga America ke sath
The humanity is on crisis..not yet recover from pandemic..now war😱
We were saying this for years. As a Baltic countries we warned every one. Don't trust russia. They have oil and gas, western money, and all high tech from China. Your sanctions are pathetic. Nato shoul've been on Ukraine long ago. Should use force and squash them once for all.
glad they put the press word on your kevler
Where are the libs to cry out, 
What did I just hear.” This is not a war the public wanted.” Not human thoughts, that statement is worse than war. Only ppl who want war live in the desert you simple minded blucks
As a Russian, I’m so sad to hear about Ukraine right now.. Please do not resent the people of Russia, we are not our government. I wish you all safety ❤️
This wouldn’t happen if anyone didn’t vote for Biden.
America is a republic not a democracy
Leave Russia to deal with its own situation otherwise billions will die in a nuclear war & the ones that want the war they and their kind will be safe in underground bunkers. &
🇵🇱❤️🇺🇦
It's the peoples fault that putin is in power. How on earth do people in this day an age think its they should get a free pass. In the olden times dictators or warlords gave no choice, but back to back elections and they happily voted for him.
You gotta be pretty brave to protest Putin in the centre of Moscow ..
What most countries don't realize is that we are all on one planet and the only place for human existence. If a nuclear war broke out, only extinction awaits.
When ego and pride is more important then the people/citizens lives.
I pray for all civilians in the area. This is appalling that this can happen in today’s world.  Scared for the whole world.
Can I find here any Russian citizens who don't approve this attack? Please give me hope you are alive..
Its interesting to see how people say things like 
This is so 😥😔😟🙁😞
My prayers for all Ukrainians.  Putin is a monster.
Tu murwega subko Putin tera bura nahi chahta tha bus America se na jude
Please, war is not the answer. All those poor civillian oh my god I don't know what to say.
It hasn't mattered who was in charge in Russia, from Tsars to Stalin to Putin. They have all been paranoid about being surrounded by enemies - Vikings, Tartars, Teutonic Knights, Polish/Lithuanians, Turks ... Not to mention their own aggressive expansionism. Their history makes them unique, IMO. Since the breakup of the Soviet Union, the US has played a losing game.
Pero cuando u ten estaba ma ya do inosente sibilina en donas anadie le in portaba
Putting is  killer!
Why Ukrainian leaders agree to join Cold War Organization NATO and put strategic weapons on its board? They could not be Finland or Swissland? The leader of Ukrainian is just a tragedy  actor and pawns, where it’s people end up suffering
Great job sleepy joe.
GRAB THE POPCORN MY DUDES. IT'S HAPPENING
Why should Russia not look at its own interests, it was fine was it, when the west destroyed many of the middle eastern nations
Send fireballs back to Russian.
BBC is a liar.
Nuclear war wouldn't end all human life, it would only affect the countries being bombed and those in close proximity. Africa would be mostly unscathed by such an event. Nuclear winter would be most people's argument, but that is just an hypothesis and the decline in temperature wouldn't be as drastic as some would believe.
You say that like it's a bad thing.
Yeah this is horrible
Putin is doing this because, as he said, Ukraine was being armed by the West. Zelensky is in power via a US manipulated coup. Pride nor ego has nothing to do with this.
 @Terry Bridge  sure it does. Russia has nuclear. Ukraine doesn't. Thier was no need just a land grab.
Yep ego, pride and hypocrisy from both side NATO and Russia
 @Terry Bridge  Ukraine can do whatever they want. If they want to join Nato then so be it. Trying to be a dictator of another country isn't how things work.
 @Terry Bridge  you're actually delusional
 @Xwl  A naive perspective of geopolitics.
 @nilsthatboi  Prove my delusion.
 @Xwl  if only global politics really worked like that
 @Anime Lover  then why is France trying to get Ukraine in NATO to place nukes in it? 🤔🤔
I disagree with you, why? Look at usa track record.. knowing know the land with radiation is unsafe that they used as a nuclear bomb test site near an island of islanders.... they told then is safe now and the people as test subjects.. that's wrong to many level... almost nuclear bombed 600 million people in the east..   invaded Iraq to stop oil sales using euro  as a warning to alll ... and stealing oil from the land .    Influencing the east to use usd.. . This way they get free resources cause they print usd...  that is the main point of usa pushing east..  all for free resources...  . Even if it means using their free resources and building weapons to obtain power and influence.. not to mention huge % of usa citizens are systematically on purpose  made more poorer so they got people used as servants... ... they could of easily changed the citizen life.. especially they hold the tesserat so to say.. ability to print usd.
 @Xwl  It's war, kid. deal with it
how ego has anything to do with this. Putin is just trying to restore the Soviet union's old borders. Geopolitics for dummies 101 😭😭
 @Home steading Tennessee river  A land grab to prevent what they saw as a pro-Western client State being armed against them. Why is their perspective wrong, and ours right? NATO promised not to expand, it did anyway. The West removed, by coup, a pro-Russian president in Kyiv, and installed a pro-Western president.
 @GodlyNetworks  Yeh, we're getting alot of resources out of Poland, Latvia, Estonia... mid-East oil goes into a world market, and no one is stealing it.
 @Terry Bridge  The US wasnt taking over Ukraine its accepting help from the west. Plus it was never intending to invade Russia in the first place. Secondly Putin has literally stated that the fall of the USSR was the greatest disaster of the 20th century. All he wants is his territory back. His claims are bullshit and if Ukraine wanted to join nato they can because its their choice to on their own SOVEREIGN land. Not Putins land. Stop justifying literally nazi tactics done by Putin.
 @Terry Bridge  It is literally Sudetenland all over again
 @Terry Bridge  Uh huh, that's quite hypocritical since he's arresting his OWN PEOPLE who speak out against him. He's a disgusting human pile of filth.
 @nilsthatboi  Your inference to nazism is ill placed, as is Putins' Your points fulill a Western view. Putin sees it different. What if China was arming Mexico? Tell a Russian the West won't invade and you'll be laughed at. Historically the southeast region on Ukraine has been under Russian control for centuries. Even when  Ukraine didn't exist. Germany would not allow Ukraine into NATO, so that's a wasted point.
 @nilsthatboi  Cannot deny the historical connections. Although, Putin isn't an idiot, while Hitler was.
 @Terry Bridge  Hitler had mental illness and good thing. But I feel like Putin will lose his temper someday too. He's already an idiot for invading in the first place. His country will feel the consequences on economic level and political level.
 @Terry Bridge  China already finances and lends money to the entire world already making their influence known but this is another topic. Plus the example of arming mexico wouldnt have mattered. Putting nukes in Europe was not done by NATO in the first place for this exact reason. There is no reason for NATO to invade Russia. The whole reason Ukraine wanted to join Nato was because russia was putting troops at their border and annexing crimea. They started this and now they're mad NATO wanted to disrupt their plans? Putin has been planning this for years making West europe need russian gas. Its obvious if you look at the timeline that this plan has been on the table for years.
 @Terry Bridge  why would they want a Russian president in Ukraine.  Same reason Americans wouldn't want a Russian president. You make know sence. You want some one telling you what to do in your house I don't think so. You can't expect to live in another country and have different country political system other than the country your in. Like the Mafia in new York. Hell you don't like the system their leave. Some one camps in my yard fine. But don't block my front door. Like a kid living under your roof you go by dads rules or get the hell out you're not gonna running me out of home because you don't like what's on TV. Leave by get your on place. Yes I'm gonna protect what's mine if I have to go get my neighbor that's a friend of mine.
I'm glad cold blooded murder and the destruction of an independent nation's entire infrastructure is entertaining for you. Sick.
Russia's own interests won't be helped at all by attacking Ukraine. They're now a rogue state, a pariah. Putin's ambition will kill many of his own soldiers not to mention Ukrainian forces and civilians. He's destabilized the entire world order. Putin has just killed the Russian economy and his people will pay the price.
Fart in my mouth
AT LAST !rrRussia is about to free the ukrainian people from the yoke of fascism they have suffered under for 8 long years.rrGod Bless mother Russia !
I bet investors would leave Europe and go to US and UK now.
No fire balls to report from Palestine Syria Lybia Yemen etc etc no!??You’re a gang of psychopaths
Y'all are as bad as Russia's propaganda for not telling or showing the whole story.... Where's the news of everyone trying to pull Ukraine into the trash can off Nato and where is the interviews with the loads of Russian supporters there.
I thought killing civilians was a war crime 🤔
People of Ukraine are paying the price of their egoistic leader soon the people of Russia will face that
This is pure madness
The west forced Russia to the wall. They didn't have more steps back. Ukraine as a NATO member? Let me put a question: Why do you think Finland is NOT a NATO member?
Democracy?‽ people of Ukraine have suffered under this so called corrupt Ukraine government.. let's not forget wat their so called democratic party in control now did to their opposition.. iam not saying wat Russia is doing is right, cos it's not alright to violate the space n freedom of women n children.. so sad. Wrong n very evil.. I hope this ends now
I didn't see any Ukraine army in any movie or in the city
They shouldn’t have threaten Russia
تسقط روسيا
His 600 billion won't last long with the sanctions.
If only they showed this much footage with syria and Palestine being attacked r.i.p to the innocent :(
Putin is so desparate to get Ukraine as strategic advantage for Russia to invade or declare war to European countries. it just like Germany invading Poland to invade Russia. history repeats itself.
Pray for putin that God can soften his heart!
My heart goes out to everyone  in Ukraine, to everyone in Europe, to everyone in the world
What a Joke - John Kerry comes out today saying he's worried about Climate Change, Joe Biden needs to put the 
Putin says they asked them to lay down their arms why? So they cant defend their own families. Rise up people. Do not depend on Government to help civilians protect your own families.

 @KodeKraft RC  ty
Even Putin?
https://youtu.be/L0G9WRRWIuM.
Wouldn't believe anything the BBC puts out. All these world leaders are in the same big club!!
Russia attacks Ukraine = Nato bombed Serbia 1999
Trump Approves of this
The public will suffer not the regime.
Y’all see the audi use the sidewalk
Well the commies die
Stay safe. Esspecially the innocent children
This guy literally thinks Ukraine is Russia's. What a psycho.
2022.....
This could start a world war ….. absolute madness all nations will stand together to defeat this evil
No terorists because no islam but religion colonial
USA rise up, we have to help them!!!
ХАХАХАХАХАХА
Killing innocent families shows how corrupt and selfish governments truly are if you keep voting these people in then this will keep happening.
Russians should think twice pls civilians has noting to do with this. Why most you kill an innocent souls?
Syriya palestine ughiyurs burmese and afgans were all victim to the greed of the powerful superpowers like usa europe china and russia.
А теперь вспомните ,какие события происходят , об этом говорила  Ванга.
I good to hear that Russia will capture the Ukraine I'm very happy. Ukraine feel happy when they listen about they will coming in Ukraine. Soo many people's move to Ukraine for study and they will rejected them with no reason. Now i wish it will part of Russia and Russia will rule on them 🥰
Not good 😭
Aora saben lo que le isieron a Irak y nadie iso nada y todo fue una mentira para saciar las riquezas de irak
That's because Trump is Putin's boyfriend.
 @KodeKraft RC  🍆
Ukraine wish that.they will come in Europe but i wish it will par of Russia and Russia will rule on them. Love you Russia
Anyone asking where is nato has no idea what an atomic/nuclear bomb is… as of right now Russia is being nice. Just wait till WW3 starts then you’ll regret nato stepping in.
EU reject Turkey , why can't Nato similarly just reject Ukraine, it is because of the US. Which countries feels safe being surrounded by US placed missiles at their doorstep?
I feel like we need to do everything we can to stop this. Imagine if it was your family. I understand the power Putin has ready to blow up nearly everything.  But we just gonna watch?????
Fight back Ukraine you guys got this. All hopes go to you. Ukraine for life 🇺🇦 ❤
I truly hope that Metro 2033 doesn't actually happen.
Only god 🙏 can save
Why must there always be war??
Ukrain , stfu and pickup weapon for fucks sake
I hate Putin. I mean at least Trump kept his bullshit at bay, Trump made us look strong and Biden makes us look weak and that's Putin is attacking again. Trump told him it would be war if he started again. What doesn Biden do nothing. Sanctions ain't gonna do shit. It definitely isn't gonna stop putin.
Where is nato? Nato is useless?
Body bags filled with Russians need to make the common Russian go after their leader.
https://youtu.be/RovHeimIiRQSTOP WAR WE HATE WAR
So heartbreaking it makes me cry! This should not be happening in 2022!!!!
It's all about profit for the military-industrial complex.
and where is covid now?? no more fake news about covid ???
They should get rid of putin.He will start a world war.
I’m so sorry, this is just awful and I wish someone could do something for these poor people. I wish I could just go and get them and make them safe. All my prayers 🙏🙏 I’m really so sorry, my heart hurts for all of them.
Self defense. Putin you have INVADED another country.
Winners are US and Uk! losers are Ukrainian Russia EU ! Who can get more weapon sales? Who can put EU in all kinds of trouble and beneficial from it? Who could increase energy prices? Who could still be out of trouble from this conflict?
US&Z and NATO cheated Russia for decades and lied. Russia has all rights to defend its borders and secure  life for Russians. ZIoNazis running Ukrain are responssible for what is going on today. They killed innocent Russians and now is payback day.
Maybe if you didnt build military bases on their doorstep maybe this wouldnt happen
Where is NATO?All NATO members should withdraw and ask for compensation from America.
Pray 🙏
My heart goes out to the civilians. Turkey<3Ukrain
It seems cities like Kharkiv and Mariupol are already under control of Russian army and Russian special forces are 20km from Kiev, capital. I hope Putin puts a stop to this madness, however I am surprised by the lackluster resistance by Ukrainian army. Russian military convoys are able to advance into Ukraine from border check points and drive on highways without any meaningful resistance
Why are the Russians doing this the stupid government sucks its rigged also its not democratic its a dictatorship with Putin as leader
1:08 that building looks pretty good for a 'rocket attack'...
Ukraine's president just told his people that Bidon is going to help. They didnt translate that part in this segment. Sorry to say the Americans arent coming.
Plz watch my video song
I see Putin as a new age HITLER, he is just as mad, and have now started what is the potential start of a 3. World War, Putin don`t give a care about civilians and world peace, he just want what he wants and go all limimits to get it. Putin have  NO right to do this, NO right to rape and force a nation who have xhoosen to be independant. . . . What Putin does right now is a Crime, crime of war.
What a joke putin.🤡
😔
Ukraine was with Hitler II WW. 1.09.1939 with Nazi and Slovakia - Ukraine attacked Poland. people remember WOLYN 1943. Deport all Ukrainiens from Poland.
Plz watch my video song
putin..you want more innocent people die? how idiot you are. no body destroy your country. you destroy other country.
Self defense and you are the one attacking stop being stupid you pig
I pity those that thought a KGB agent; that's Putin would honor his word. As soon as I saw a video of Putin saying he wouldn't attack Ukraine, I already knew he would. Then when they had there first talks and nothing came out of it, it should of been obvious that it was going to happen no matter what. All those talks that they scheduled was just Putin buying time to build up his military power in the areas he wanted. All the signs were right in your faces, and you still hoped for peace. Just to clarify things again, when a KGB agent says they aren't going to do something, you can bet they are going to do something. It was right in your face, and now you are dealing with the problem on short notice. Saw a video of Russian tanks crossing a pretty big bridge, and as I watched my first thought was; why didn't they rig that bridge with explosives. Blow the bridge when they get 75% of the way over it taking out a nice chunk of Russian armored vehicles. But it wasn't rigged with explosives and the bridge is being used as a highway for a Russian invasion. I feel bad about all of this, but at the same time I don't. You all had warning and yet Ukraine seems to not be taking the necessary steps to keep the Russians out of key points.
That’s no self defense… he is a bully…
The Russia leader is a demon …..
NATO and AMERICA abandoned them.....
So sad save all ukraine people and children
Terrible. I pray for peace for your country and the safety of your people.
Praying for Ukraine, Lord please intervene, especially the Childrens protect them dear Lord
Constant threat? What a coward!!
War does not bring alliances Russia. It brings destruction and weakness. For this is Russia’s and the dead Soviet Union’s ultimate weakness.
World should do something against Putin.
ALL BECAUSE OF NATO AND US INTERFERENCE.
Nothing changes...human nature the less. Very sad
Don't die for your country Mark. Make the other side die for theirs. Best of luck & God  speed good Sir.
Can we just live in peace love and kindness..just how are heavenly father  wants us live righteously in peace love and happiness... Prayer in Jesus name Amen make this beautiful earth a better peaceful righteously  place to live..no war ...
Bloody Mean Putin
🥰 Lets come together and raise the vibes on our Mother Earth Gaia 💗Lets pray for our brothers and sisters in Ukraine 🇺🇦 and Russia Lets set the intention that the soldiers and commanders on both sides Refuse to follow orders Refuse to hurt the Ukrainian civilians Pray Putin opens his heart ♥️ Let us all raise our hearts & minds in our Christ consciousness ❤️
I can’t believe that this is actually happening. We are literally living in history at this very moment
Now you god fearing folks see your prayers are useless It's fake
We need to send troops, air force, Navy to attack Russian forces and help Ukraine immediately but Biden is too cowardly
Don't actually trust what BBC reports on this.
Biden US president.Trump world president
Literally watching major military movements with those things called satellites. “ what do you mean, those are defensive coordinations.”
Mad isn’t it. I’m sat on the toilet watching history unfold.
 @Jonathan Gallie  bro same
Yes because this kind of thing has never happened eh 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤡🐸
 @Norma Bates  Not in my lifetime.
Nice nazi profile pic
ikr its so embarrasing to see ppl think war was the answer
Western military intelligence have been keeping up with the movement of Russian troops for weeks now. Why is this a surprise? The US have kept warning over and over, day by day on Russian military movements. Everyone didn't believe it. Now when Russia invades, people forget the past few weeks of warnings of an invasion?
 @Veronica C.  were you not alive in 2014?
 @Veronica C.  There's still war going on in different parts of the world......
 @Ava S.  If its not on bbc and cnn it never happened really, how couldn't you know that?
The scary sound of sirens :'( This shouldn't be happening anywhere to anyone :'(
This is horrible, but why translation from Russian language is not right??¿?????¿?????????
It's like a bully walks into the school picking on little ones. And everyone just watches it happen. Sad
Avengers Assemble now!!!!
Ooohhh....God why now.???
Guys please upvote this comment someone need to figure out what the whispering in the background at 8:21 is. I know it sounds paranoid but maybe someone is trying to send a message.
Yo Putin I've arranged for you a room next to Hitler, enjoy your final days.
This is going to turn into an insurgency.
Biden needs to open that pipeline back now before more lives are lost,  I might not know all the details of this problem  but God knows whos at fault,  I wouldnt want to be in his shoes come judgment day.   There will be a judgement day.
All this proved that NATO is useless and a scam done on name of security of less privleged countries.
#PutinIsADick-tator
remember reloadsies...
Where's NATO to help people? NATO is weaker.
America 🇺🇸 stands with Ukraine 🇺🇦
BBC: one site coulored news only; do your own research!
Ukraine should have stayed neutral rather that leaning towards US and NATO. Feel sorry for the innocent civilians..
It's not a full scale invasion, but I was hoping Putin wouldn't go far like this but he did... :/
In war no one win ‼️poor innocent people 😭😭😭
Paying the price of western hypocrisy
If it can happen there it can happen anywhere
My prayers to Ukrainian people's, God bless them, 🙏😥😥sending prayers and love from 🇵🇭
Images of repatriated 'Russians' ... Old ladies with walkers getting off buses.Images of westward flee ...  A scene from the movie 28 Days Later.I'm sure there is some bias, but we still seem to have a discrepancy.
Need peace
Will Antifa help. Putin is trying to get rid of Nazis. Ps. This wouldn't of happened with Trump as US President,reap your reward lefties.
I am just shock that everyone is shock. Prayers to Ukraine 🙏 My heart is completely broken. There are babies there! Dammit!  😭💔
Self defence,  hahaha.  Dimocraps lied,  Ukraines died.
Prayers to end this war now please God intervene and spare the Ukranians.
Ukraine should have never given up their nukes
Seeing all the comments of how 
USA IS THE ONLY EVIL ON EARTH JUST LOOK BACK ON HISTORY! HOW MANY COUNTRIES THEY HAVE DESTROYED AND HOW MANY PEOPLE THEY HAVE KILLED!!!
Because Biden is Hiden. The old shoe is trembling in the Whitehouse in his adult diaper.
What a time to be alive!!!
Please 🙏 stop this this is not right
WE PROMISED UKRAINE MILITARY SUPORT FOR GIVING UP THERE NUKES,,, sanctions is it  ?? SAD DAY FOR AMERICANS !!!
Self defense but attacked first.... The Audacity
Just surrender and Russia far easier.
He is evil son of satan
Revelation !!
Putin is just one man. If the Russian military refused to obey his illegal orders, the war would over before it began - i.e. mount a military coup against the Kremlin. Otherwise, they're complicit and fair game in the defence of Ukraine. Now, the world's gloves need to come off. Send every Russian ambassador and consul home from every corner of the globe. Cancel all Russian visitors's visas and send them home. Revoke all business relationships, and turn off any shared digital media other than our news channels. Shut down all their banks on foreign soil. Fly all our respective citizens visiting Russia home before they can no longer flee that country. Re-open cold cases where Putin has arranged the murder of Russians on foreign soil, such as Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia poisoned by him in the UK. As a priority admit Ukraine to NATO, and send allied armies, ships, tanks and other ordnance from every corner of the globe to support Ukraine: stare down the Russian military and stop this idiot. Convene UN to end Russia's veto power and expel it from the UN Security Council. The Russian ambassador to the UN should not be chairing meetings any more. If this escalates further, another option is to shoot down the Kosmos satellites. The regime has to be emasculated, snipped in the bud before it has the chance to start another world war. If Russia is allowed to usurp Ukraine, devastation, famine and energy poverty will engulf the region and flow across Europe. ACT NOW
Fuck Russia
LOL
WW3... no winners here! 🤔
The suffering civilians had nothing to do with the acts of their leadership who were playing in the hands of enemies of Russia and were irritating Russians for years. This is very unfortunate that greedy and 
It didn’t take a brain scientist to figure he would attack. He wrote several articles saying Ukraine should be Russian. Purine mother is Ukrainian
Russia is Fighting Nazis once again.
This is terrible… I sit here while my 2 year old son naps next to me just thinking of that family trying to make it out so their 2 year old can survive this…. Hopefully Putin has a medical emergency tonight and he can be a distant past…
Stop this war as soon as you can before it it becomes a third World War.
This is Because of America trying to make Ukraine a part of nato and Russia is threatened by it because America keeps pooking at them for years now its not funny anymore
Fuck Putin.  Russians need to do something about this guy, or they are the ones who will suffer for it.
Agressor Putin 👎👎👎👎👎
And all the rest of the world is gonna do is impose sanctions like that does anything Russia knows the rest of the world is just an animal with no teeth so they have no reason not to invade whatever country they want. Damn shame we are just going to willfully let history repeat itself All world leaders except the Ukrainian president deserve to burn in the deepest part of hell for letting this happen because of economic fears.
Now will the UK and its European allies take defence seriously.
Listen there isn't any civilians being hit only military installations
America and Europe and Israel needs to be occupied by someone else.
We are living in times where tragedies can be sent around the world by someone with a mobile phone, if they have a connection that is.
Plz stop the war
I know this sounds weird but I think someone is trying to send out a message at 8:21. Listen closely to the whispering
Hoping for limited casualties as Ukraine comes to terms with its true reality.
Im not saying anything about the whole situation but 70% of this tension is created by BBC and other western media giants as soft propaganda. Im just a bystander i don't care but it's pain to watch and not get triggered anyway
Why the leaders don't fight it out and leave the people out of it
Must be a mini nuke? He used.
i hope the majority of people escaped to the west before the bombing .
Hitler did the same thing and look what started a WW2.
A crisis after a crisis. Russian government is keeping up the face of the entire Russia as it always has been throughout the history. The rulers in Kreml are nothing more than demons. We cannot have peace if Putin and likeminded people are alive.
I know this is Bidens fault, because he closed the pipeline down,  but where s the russian mofia to stop Putin from hurting those innocent people.  I am against war,  killing of innocent people for what a pipeline,  or oil as in usa.  Wrong.
This will not be a world war as there isnt a single country prepared to help Ukraine fight it militarily. They have left Ukraine all alone.
What are Russian civilians and residents doing?  They should do protest.
Adolf Putin the corrupt murderer. ...God bless Ukraine. ..Make them pay....uk
Nato!? you will get better help from the USO .
I hope all of them stay safe. God bless them all
Russia is something but I m more afraid of what China and Iran would do next.
Putin is scared...warning everyone not to get involved simply means he is worried about his actions, who would have thought a Nazi would be running Russia incredible.
Ukraine will be freed again 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
Time to draft all the stunning and brave women and send them to the front. We must achieve equity in the army.As a white male, I will stay in the back and let the brave women show us how it's done.
🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
Myself like to suggeste Putin to stop conquer URSS members that separated from Russia bc more Putin use force more Russia's neighbors will join Western Democracy.
Looks like I'm going to miss my flight. Ain't the Ukrainian president was once a comedian?
You can see the difference between the citizens of Ukraine and Russia in the enterviews how they behave or express their feelings is so obvious Russia is the one living in opression the only reason they had to invade Ukraine is to prove Puttin's power and with that acction he brought shame to himself but to his people.
you got a case of biden derangement syndrome
Wtf are you talking about? Biden's fault? Putin just invaded Ukraine without any provocation. The pipeline to Germany was closed by Germany in response to the invasion. The blame for this crisis is 100% on Putin.
 @Shawn Crawford  Fox news said it was Biden so it must be Biden
This is white people's war, not everyone else's war.
There is no front line, Russian Troops already rolled right passed it without a problem.Just an observation!
What a time to be alive. Global Pandemics, Murder Hornets, and WW3
Long live Ukraine and the people prayers from New England in America
This is awful.😢 Praying🙏
The world stands with Russia, Putin, and the people of Ukraine who were all made victims by the obiden-soros kiev coup in 2014.ddooo
This is happening in the post Merkel and post Trump era. Weak leaders in the West cause Tyrants like Putin and Xi to be aggressive. It’s time to isolate and exclude Russia and China from the Western economies and Universities.
Turn it into a guerrilla war Ukrainians.
😄😆😆😄LIERS
How is this happening this day in age? We must not take this lightly! This may be just a heads up to the world of what Russia is capable of! We must wake up and start thinking about peace in our countries ASAP!! 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
HOW THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT OF ALL OF THIS???
NATO ,USA and zelensky provoke putin
The criminal Ukrainian regime is killing it's own people and trying to blame it on Putin. We know this because they've already shelled a kindergarten school in Ukraine a week ago saying it was the beginning of the Russian invasion.
LSad news and lest pray fr them 🙏. .
I can understand bomb airports, factories etc some vital infrastructures, but NOT Bomb residential areas, it’s disgusting
What about the people living there
Putin lovers are poping up. Ignore them. Слава Україні!!!🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
European don't like war when it is the  back yard but is  they killing rapping and abuseing nation like Iraq where you kill tow millions people yeman Syria somalia for the European and American Australian and Canadian governments war good for they when is happening fare country's
She looks evil as hell
Let's start the war games. NOW!!
what UKRAINE DID deserve this
Universe, please give us the most peaceful and quick way out of this situation.
Trump is in company with all of the greedy people who look at the rest of the world as theirs to take and conquer, no matter what the cost of the rest of the world's life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  A Putin led Russia is  their army, so they don't have to get their hands dirty with the rest of the world's blood.  It's up to the rest of the world to care about each other. We should appeal to the Russian people, even the Russian army to stop the invasion(s).rrdid the government of Ukraine declare all land, air and commercial borders closed to Russia and Belarus?  then that army will be declared unlawful entry.rrit's time for the late night hosts to appeal to the public to stop the Russian war against Ukraine, why sit back and analyze it.
who else is totally fed up and tired of all the moralless leaders.
Nice propaganda video :D :D
They should remove ads for these types of videos.. A damn up tempo tiktok in the middle
We NEED to step in
cant much blame  them russians remember what we did when we had them in our back yard Cuba
You get this war because NATO and your President debit card!!!!!
Putin literally said the best defense is a strong offense
Putin, the next Hitler 😨
Emporer Putin. insane on all levels.  Poor Ukraine, Praying for your People.
What the mida didn't tell us is that for 8 years the nazis from kiev were killing and making all kind of atrocities against civilians of Donbass, Luganski, and last week 700 thousands of civilians were moved from their homes against the threats of Ucranians and nazis milicians.
Let's unite in prayer saints all over world from SA
The Russian way of war is very brutal w/ no regard for civilians. They use a lot of thermobaric weapons. Fire bombs that steal oxygen. Very destructive and indescrimanate. Shame on the agressors. Violaters of a sovereign country. Putin is the latest madman at this time in history.
Lets go Putin! Western hegemony is done!!! Finally, world will be better place ! Nato destroyed Yugoslavia without approval of UN. Payback, destroy Nato countries next mister Putin! Welcome to new world , Russia!
wishes go out to ukraine and palestine
This shows the you the power of the media. If you go to Russia Today you can hear their reporters just outright lie and claim ignorance about widespread attacks and civilian casualties.
USA ONLY KILL AND DESTROY US
Self defense !?!!??!??!!?!!? Ukraine wasn’t a threat to Russia. Never was
Russians support Putin in this?
😞 😔 😢 🇺🇦 ❤️
It is very ironic that UK and US take their hands over their heads and seem horrified thinking Russia wants to invade Ukraine but UK and US are invasora countries of all of times, UK no only stole lands it stole wealth too so come on don’t be  SO SO hypocritical now
This is horrible, My heart goes out to the civilians.
I feel so sorry for Ukrainians and Russians as well. The people in Russia seem they do not support kremlins actions and Putins plan
Fake. Bit exaggeration news
United fuck of America puts and clown 🤡 out for presidick so they can do this kind of stuff. And blame it on the people who voted for them.  It's a WAR GAME and folks don't believe the news.
The west please send your white boy military to your Allie ukraine lol
Why do people not fire bazookas from all the windows onto the tanks? Fight the Russians as the Germans in WW2!
Here's an idea, assainate putin
China  what are you waiting for lol you forgot Taiwan
Well the KGB Goon did what they are train to do!!!!Putin is a Murderer , maybe the Germans will wake up!!! , before walls are built AGAIN in Europe!!!! When they will EVER LEARN!!!
Where are American troops....

I just wonder how long this war is going to last, and what the economical impact will be?
It looks like Ukraine 🇺🇦 did very little to nothing to defend themselves or the country, they are showing no resistance!  They had plenty of time....   Why not??? Seems like there is little sense of urgency, they didnt believe US or EU intelligence and lacking any level patriotism.
Nato should stay out of this
願上天庇祐。邪不能勝正 。魔鬼遠離。
FUCK YOUR TROOPS,EVERYTHING USA DID WAS A DISASTER IN THE HISTORY
When Israel bombed in Palestine so EUROPE MAKE SILENCE NOW WHY EUROPE IS BARKING ON RUSSIA ???? RUSSIA HAS RIGHTS TO SAVE HIS COUNTRY
...
That's whats you get for bombing  a airport  with jet fuel its highly  explosive  combustible  nature.
That's whats you get for bombing  a airport  with jet fuel its highly  explosive  combustible  nature.

اوف شنو ذنب العوائل الابرياء 💔😔
Good news, uproot the nazis from the beginning ,safer for the future...
God bless you all 🙏😔💙
Honestly? Looks like a long abandoned five-store building, on 1:10.  No window or door frames, no paint on the walls inside, no traces of destruction, fire, etc.  Dezo.  Do not fall on this cheep piece of lie.
Israel bomb syria and America bomb somalia and no report's. I support russia
Ukraine people need to pray to Jesus. The world end is near. All people need to repent.
Period of Russian Shame
Funny how Russia considers it a “defense” when they’re invading a country and throwing bombs everywhere.
Anyone hear the whispering starting at 8:21??
Here’s what the globalist MSM isn’t telling everyone :https://youtu.be/KAXWAA5GnEI
And that's why Russian president Putin could have never be trusted.
Funny how you don't know that Ukraine kept doing that first , constantly provoking. USA is involved in this all along with Ukrainian presidend and the rest of propaganda.  They were tolerated for a long time, it's natural that Putin will not allow NATO to approach him!
 @Lela L.  So the Russian invasion is a natural consequence of 
Putin is the new Hitler
Wow, when NATO invaded Yugoslavia, you never report like this.
It is sad but I know in frist hand  what it  feels like to be in in war and the western countries love going Afghanistan Iraq yeman Syria somalia killing rapping and abuseing those nations but the European don't war when it is theri back yed
HEY PUTIN,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,   YOU ARE A TRUE MO################## TH ##################R PACKING GREEDY SON O A B######H ! YOU CAN`T EVEN FEED YOUR ENTIRE RUSSIAN POPULATION, YET YOU WANT MORE TERRITORIES ???????????????????????????///  PACKING BULLS ###############TS.  YOU ARE SIMPLY A S###H####TBUG LOADS OF RUBBISH.
DONT CRY ABOUT OTHERS!!!THINK  WHAT USA DID TO OUR HUMAN KIND
War has come to Europe, GOOD ,its time for Europe to feel what they do to other countries, FINISH IT.
Russian ppl need to go out and protest !! It is better to be arrested trying to prevent war than being nuked and dying being ok with war. If this is the beginning of WW3, everyone in Russia will die so yeah it is better to be arrested preventing the war than dying from it.
May make its way to the USA.
We as modern humans, we're are supposed to be above this kind of treatment towards each other in the World.... as fellow human beings... This is a straight forward liar, to claim Ukraine as a threat!!??  What we are seeing is a tyrant of the highest order. He needs to be arrested and charged with War crimes to the innocent human beings who are being affected. Get it together International World leaders... Pray for Ukraine
I don't understand how this is even a thing, how can the rest of the world let Russia do this ? How does a Russian soldier think this is the right thing to do? Putin said it was self defense but does anyone really believe Ukraine would have done anything to Russia? Probably not they just want to live their life how they want and in peace. NATO should do something about this and im not against a hit to take out Putin at this point, he's a psycho just like Winnie the Pooh and NK. I don't understand how we let these things happen to innocent people, just to satisfy the greed of one man.
Why the War? is it Oil, or Gold, no, Ukraine wants independence, from Russia, must people die,
Try mandates lol
When the 4 horsemen coming?
get out now before the nukes come i think ww3 is near
Lol good job joe
stop telling them where the civilians are hiding! when u say it on the news its not like they cant see it too
Why? Fck you Putin. Hope Russia people protest and choose new leader.
War is sad yes ,but its never stopped for 2000 years every day palestrine Afghanistan northern Ireland parts if Africa all over the world 🌎 but now its so close to your own country you realise its real if you pray then do so for all wars to end one love one world 🌎
Kill Ukrainian president and save Ukrainian! He sell him Countrey!!!!!
Ukraine is collateral damage of US and allies for their own agendaThey should stop and let other nations rule themselves
If that was a residential building struck by a missle, where are the dead bodies? It looked like it was abandoned.
yeahh sorry guys  but if u are so idiot that u waiting for NATO to help then u deserv what u get and for a 2nd reason : why should w send our kids and destroy families to a war wich has nothing but nothing to do with my country (Russia didnt do anything to my Country) and also Ukraine is not NATO member. If u wanna play westernized people and u think Putin is the Devil then OK come to fake United Europe and NATO wich is an aliance on the papers. If there is not something the BIG heads will get from, forget army and military Nato support. ITS FACT its not just my opinion.
So covid is not enough?
The West has to stop with provocating Russia.
Where is NATO?
Sanctions were NEVER going to work --------------- not until Россия bankrupts itself again.
i hope usa and some europian countries destroyed to feel at least a little bit what you have done to the middel east and north africa    karma
Only cowards would want to live under a dictatorship that you can not even protest.
All of this because Ken griffin didn’t cover
if anyones the nazis its the russian government
Usa es un provocado..Putin lo avisada que tenian que sacar su ejercicio de frontera de rusia y Ukraine pero presidente de u.s.a lo denegoY mirar haora quepasa.Donde esta haora mismo 
ZELENSKY LEFT THE COUNTRY
Zaustavite rat u ime djece 🙏
To target civilians,who are defenceless shows the actions of a psychopath devoid of empathy,completely oblivious to innocents being murdered.world peace is now teetering on the brink
Brought to you by Brandon....
Ever wonder what it would have been like if WW2 had the kind of news coverage of today? I have, and I feel like I'm watching it now.
So what? What will you do to us? You Big Ben will be destroyed by the Russian army, you will be silent🤣🤣
Stay strong Ukraine, Love from Chile 🇨🇱❤️
I don’t know who any of u are but I hope to god we all survive
Where's the structural damage from the attack? Where's the debris?
Glad I live in Australia
President of Russia has told the target will later be to take halv of Europe for Russia and China.And he do what he says.
well, USA/GB staged the coup in 2013. now after eight years of civil war russia steps in.
Is Lviv safe now
My heart goes out to all civilians ,but nato and the west have been warned to sort out this problem for over 8 years now im british and live in uk but Russia has had rocket attacks for years now into its own country by so called ukrainian rebels ukrainian Russian rebels where then backed by russia to stop it then the west backed ukrainian rebels to keep fighting .8 years of fighting with russia constantly pleading to a end of it and still the west kept backing the ukrainian rebels with money and weapons this was always going to end like this and its not putins fault at all but camerons ,obamas and boris and nato and eu.
BBC: BEST BALLS COMMUNICATORS
Tribunal for Putin 🤬🤬🤬
This is terrible
The people almost never want war, but it always happens
This part of Europe went from one hands to another untill  XVIII century.
Its a war already lost for ukranian. It would had been another story if Ukraine was an Otan country.
Yall can thanks NATO and the United States for interfering and surrounding Russia and China for years at this point Russia have every right to invade if you could just look on the map where Moscow is in Ukraine and where NATO troops are all at. yeah imagine that reverse on the US borders.
What about 8 years of bombing Donbass by Ukraine army against women and children?
Stop Putin now ,or later will be too late.
When you live next to a bear, don't poke him in the eye. You will lose your fingers.Be polite and keep a low profile. By inviting Nato  forces to your country you are asking for trouble. 😂 BE Smart. Don't listen to USA.
Self Defense....  What a joke & huge lie!
#BIDENISTHEROOTCAUSE #NOTRUST #NOTRUTH #NORESPECT #NOBRAINS #NOSCIENCE
Blame the E U     and NATO !!  they forced Putin s hand !!
Republicans must be happy. They've been sucking off Putin for the last decade.
Peace is like a beautiful, fragile Ukrainian Easter egg. With dictators stomping around the globe more and more and idiots voting for morons where democracy still lives, the results are obvious.
you are so right
Sad development 😭😭
Self defense? What did civilians do to you? They're the ones who are dying.
i live in finland and i think that they will do the same to our country. im scared asf
Oh this is so sad . The Europe needs to act not to talk.
West's coup government played with Russia madly.Before 2014 Russia and Ukraine were good.Everything started with this COUP GOVERNMENT...
Matthew 244 Jesus answered: “Watch out that no one deceives you. 5 For many will come in my name, claiming, ‘I am the Messiah,’ and will deceive many. 6 You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. 7 Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. 8 All these are the beginning of birth pains.
Putin is the new Hitler
Oh Russia, playing right into the devil's hand?? Now send all your russian women to our country since a lot of them will be single and widows will take good care of them preserve the bloodline lol.
USA IS THE EVEIL ON EARTH DONT FORGET THAT SON!!!
Ukraine stand strong! We all hope this doesn't last long we know you did nothing wrong. Rip to those lost and those you're loosing we are all here with you and wish you the best. Its times like these where we prove who is just a weak leader and its normally the one to start it <3
So we're are the west shitting themselves again,all talk no action complete shit houses fkn joke of the world,but then Ukraine has nuclear missiles launch them on Russia don't let nobody take your country better to die on your feet than live on your knees
The elites wanted nato in Ukraine,  Russia saw this was dangerous to them.  Anyway. that land used to belong to Russia. Its all a shame.
we need to NUKE RUSSIA !!!!!

Watch at 6:22 into the video. is it just my phone screen or does anybody notice putin is proper twitching. The guy looks like he's about to have a stroke.
So this started out with Putin declaring it a matter of protecting those who speak Russian and identifying as Russian, to Putin claiming he is going to de-militarize and de-Natzify Ukraine. So who is the delusional one now?! Next he will say that Russia will have to stay in Ukraine to assure its neutrality.
Shame on you Russia ! You are ruled by a psycotic person, who is willing to use nuclear wapons 🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️ I hope the World Will exclude Russia from anything and everything , and stop ALL Trade with Them. Lets make Russia pure again !
Military help ukrainian .Poland like  ukrainian . My będziemy nastepni .Putin is beed
https://youtu.be/L0G9WRRWIuM<
Ukraine  cut off the water supply  to Crimea. According to the UN that is a crime against humanity. YES Ukraine  did nothing wrong.
😬😬😬
This is what all aggressive Governments do and make no mistake...all Governments are aggressive. They'll find pretext to justify their actions and the rest is as always...History.
Putin you are not Claver the Jesus of Nazareth is Watching you and you need to repent with you heartless heart cause God will punish you. You are making innocent people suffer. Wait you will see the wrath of God.
No one laughing at the doom day preppers now. 🤔🤔🤔This just a sample of things to come...????
It’s clear it wasn’t civilian area… why media are making up stories!!!
This is heart breaking
Ukraine 🇺🇦❤️
too bad ukraine doesn't have oil. Other countries would have come to aid
War is terrorist attack against humanity
We are die in Ukrainian by tomorrow 😫
The US sucked the Soviet Union into the Afghan trap in 1979 which ended in bringing it down. 23 years later the US again pressured or even dared Putin to attack with the goal of solidifying NATO and strengthening the western alliance. And Putin fell right in the trap, the Ukraine trap. 
Next, China invades Taiwan, North Korea invades South korea
Europe and the US need to completely isolate Russia economically like North Korea. And that embargo should not be undone until Russia withdraws completely and pays restitution to Ukraine!
Looks more civilized than UK and other western forces did to Iraq and Libia.Same reason, dictatorship and control over mineral wealth.Let those who own it go and fight for it.The working man owns fuck all.End up paying for it anyway.
it is  Putin who is the Natzi  he is another Hitler
I don't remember you to report like that from Iraq!!!
I thought Ukraine was already Russian....we'll they are now
God WTF if Trump was still in office this would not happen. Trump is crazy enough to fight back and that is why this is happening now because our current President is all talk
Very sad what's happening in that country and its citizens my heart goes out to the people . But I remember when Americans and the alliance bombed Iraq code named shock oaw  and every western media was reported it like it was a joyful fire works. How history repeats itself ony this time western media is not so jolly.
ww3 confirmed
Love to the people of Ukraine. I wish our governments and nato would stand with you
Just get stuck in and steam roll through the entire Russia federation
Fake news. Saying Russians aren't supportive. They may not want it, but the majority of Russians support Putin. This isn't even disputed, just unmentioned. Picky and choosy w who they interview, as usual. These criminals at the BBC will get us in yet another war
am heart broken to see this.
Yes, he bombed Nazis!
uk should bring at least 1 million ukrainians as refuuugeees
Vlads  uppa
Putin: a person born with a stellium in Libra (Sun/Saturn/Neptune/Mercury) who is about as 
Honestly he has power and this is what he chooses to do with it. Pathetic
Putin why don't u go to the person that u having problem with.and fight like a man.u fight like this u a crowed.what kid done to u.
Lies.  He said he didn't want to have to invade.  YOU said he wouldn't invade.  And it's ALL IDIOT BIDEN'S FAULT.
Putin, Xi, and Kim. You know who they are and what they want.
jets were ukrainian Mig 29s
putin wants blood! Reckless man! He’s a bully!!!
Nice words for likes....
Why do Americans act like they are peace lovers and Russians are bad? You’re as bad as them! You murdered innocents in Iraq, Libya, Yemen and Afghanistan. What are you talking about lmao
The United States and NATO emboldened Ukraine and in the end they leave it alone 👈 .. how disgusting they are!
Putin has been pure evil since forever. He is the biggest world menace since Hitler.
Welp the bombarment of ukraine is happening again
OMG the greatest demicracy union is now crying!dollar need a fresh blood!
wwIII coming to a tv near you in 8k! feel like you're in the war! sponsored by Toyota, when you need a dependable truck. also brought to you by raid shadow legends. don't just watch the war! play the war!rrsorry...dark humor is how i cope...
everybody needs to hope/pray for peace! and love
This is again a failure by human governments to govern.
24/2/22War with Russia and Ukraine has just started. I feel as if it's going to be a really bad war. A nuclear war. No-one here in the UK is taking the Russia-Ukraine war seriously which is the problem. Then one two three nuclear bombs strike all of the major cities in the UK. Hopefully that never happens but tensions is higher ever since the cold war of the 1960s. Is this the start of The Cold War II or World War III? I hope not. March 16th 2022 at 6:32 EDT time is when a nuke will apparently hit El paso of Colarado according to a source.
Fake news shelter lol no one in the underground, the left wanted war now they got war
I pray 🙏 for the poor people and the poor Animals 🙏 😢 😔 😞 always the poor and vulnerable suffer Always 😢 🙏 💔
Snarling russian leader? What kind of language is that from a news channel?
Go to hell Putin!
War is young die and holders talks
Let's attack Ukraine because we don't want Nato on our borders. Invading Ukraine will bring Nato to their borders a anyway, just a new border with Poland for example.
Wow so many bots in the comments how obvious Putin statements are he clearly stated all the facts and deserve full support for what he is doing Ukraine is a made up country that dropped shells on its own people there are so many facts and videos on YouTube and worldwide you can see they ban Russian language they snipe their people it's disgusting and of course those regions are gonna seek shelters under Russia so open your eyes government in Ukraine on power now is ridiculously retarded and clearly made up by overthrowing ruling government in 2014 open your eyes. Full support to Russia they just had enough and Us and NATO only stretch their hands where they should not and encouraging conflict and expand further east now finally someone will stop them I will never forget them bombing my Belgrade Serbia!!!!
Putin has stated all this
WHY WHY ARE YOU GUYS DOING THIS TO INNOCENT PEOPLE IS RIDICULOUS!!!
Bomb Kremlin asap
Putin is China's Betch
Most borders have a defensive element river, mountain. Ukrainian/russian? Flat . Nothing but a sweep to Moscow. EU knew this so did NATO. If they (Russia) take Ukrainian they give themselves a defendable border( Dnieper, Dniester rivers)  That's why Estonia and Latvia safe. They can be contained being small. Ukraine to big to contain , to hard to defend against if strong in future backed by NATO. Ukraine has been sacrificed by west to tease Russia. They must have seen if they equip Ukraine , Russia would hit it. It's all geography.
Greedy ass holes !!! Ruining peoples lives!!!
That's a lot of blood to spill just to appease a tyrants ego.
feeling it for Ukraine America give them some support plz.
America please help us!
Godspeed Ukraine, the eyes of the world are upon you!
Who in the fuck is liking this you scumbags
I'm crying all day. My thoughts and prayers are with Ukraine.
This just awful.  The poor people of Ukraine.  Trump says he's happy Putin did it.  Yes he would be because Trump was working on setting it up for Putin what he was being impeached for!!  Corruption everywhere.  Now some are spreading rumours that China will attack Taiwan.  WTH is going on?? Putin said he wouldn't do it and then he sneak attacks them.  The world has been through enough trauma in the past couple years.  What a shame.
If yah gonna bomb bomb the old house that need to be demolished don’t waste the bomb
Ukraine is foolish enough to believe NATO expansion to encircle Russia, let's see if NATO or the west will fight or sit in offices and condemn and place sanctions. That's all they do while the Ukrainian peoples will be the ones to suffer.
BBC and CNN is false center
BBC always biased ............mean
I support Russia and Putin
The biggest threat to humanity is Russia ,China & Us ,if these 3 bast*rds live peacefully rest of the world will be happy forever
Y did Neto fuck up Russia
Russia will continue to attack and the west will do nothing meaningful againTime to put your money where your mouth is west and nato and actually it do something
Where is the help from outside know where to be seen just all talk
Putin may be wrong. But calling Ukraine a democratic country is a joke.
Absolutely horrific and horrible! God please stop this war!
NATO are modern day terrorists.I support Russia.
Fuck eyes we need to help now. I don’t know why anyones afraid of a bunch of Russian gulag slaves with no freedom, as soon as you punch Russia in the face those people will bail.
Have you ever bern crying   when Ikrsine killedeople in Donbasd?
Stand with Ukraine
One should never Trust Snake eye 👁️ wannabe dictators, this was Trump's agenda, THANK God Americans Saw the hypocrite Signs Trump should be Deposited in Russia with all his MAGA TRAITORS, beginning with Fox news 😥😢
Yo where's Klitschko brothers?
It is evil! No other word. It is pure horror!!!!!!!!
Mother Russia 🤘
Why hit civilian homes wtf? Putin is evil
Total monsters 👻 👽 😢 💔 😳
may God be with Russia!
I have lost faith completely in humanity. Russia leave Ukraine alone and take someone on your own size smh, attacking a little country that only 500 thousand strong is absolutely disgraceful and pathetic.
Stop the war ! War only make people die…😭
I wish Russia would holy war with American for what Gods Angels would watch happen.
If the 40 million citizens arm themselves they could hurt Russia. Remember Afghanistan hurt Russia.
Sorry Ukraine thank feckless Joe Biden and his liberal weakness. It's not the American people, the wealthy elite politicians are against anyone who stands in their way.
Russia will never be trusted again after this
Is Putin a suicide bomber ? Because if a nuclear war breaks out No one can win
Disgusting british accent.
putin je budalo
If I was there I would have taken off sooner than what they're doing now
Senseless war. Stupid
I’m with Ukraine 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦💛💙
Criminals at work

BBC blah blah blah
Putin is the modern day Hitler.
Give Russia to Africa if  failed to lead the people. Ukraine is a peaceful country. War  only for Russia says , Russia seems Russia is the biggest third war planner. UK, the friend to Russia should know why supports refugees, France is quite, UN and China all friends. Stop Russia to fight innocently people.
It’s Biblical My People….. Hear The word Of Our Most High!
Do you really expect the man to tell you when and where he's going to invade. You still say 
Putin is a genius  --  Donald J. Trump.
Yes, that's right, the Russians came to Ukraine to defend their interests, and not the Ukrainians to Russia. Do you know why? Because the Russians are real, and the Ukrainians are toys. Toy country, toy nation, toy president, toy history, toy army. There is nothing real about the Ukrainians.A toy story, in a word.
Why isn't the US doing something militarily to stop this?  If the US led a coalition to stop Saddam Hussein when he invaded Kuwait, why isn't Biden calling upon NATO to defend UKRAINE?  After all NATO is what this war is all about.  If NATO won't protect a nation that has indicated it wants to be a part of the West, NATO and EU, then what is NATO for?But I understand, Putin is much stronger and more formidable that Hussein was.  NATO and Biden are just afraid.  Disgusting.
OMG!!! Prayers to Ukraine 🇺🇦 ✝️ May God be with y'all ❤️
Americans dont like mirrors....
Putin began to plan this attack on the day Biden was elected. He long ago calculated the worst possible sanctions into his calculous and determined he could live with them, particularly with the help of his close ally, China. Undoubtedly, China was involved in Putin's plans all along. Once Ukraine is under Russia's control, China will make it's long expected move to take Taiwan. They've waited for the right person to occupy the oval office and Biden is a dream come true. While Russia and China have been beefing up their military power and engaged in military exercises, Biden's military has concentrated on transgender rights and critical race theory. I hope it is not too late for us to wake up.
THIS is what you get when you have seventy year old senile men (Putin) Leading countries, humans Never Learn
Get rid of Putin! He is the new Stalin.
Idiot Russian president
Only Slavic Paganism can unite all Slavs and other European by heritage, tradition and ancestor worship. Love to Europe and Slavic people. Hail Perun! Bless European heritage. People never learn!
Why wasn't SWIFT cut off as part of the sanctions? Curious...
I’m so sad to see this happening.  I have one very good friend from Russia and I thank God she is here in the USA.

Yeah that’s what I say! What a dumb excuse 🤦‍♀️😔
Putin does have a point in some way or forms, Ukraine has always had close ties to the west, which is very anti-CSTO
Now you can see where Trump gets some of his thinking points from Putin
That's tRUMP's buddy/lover you're talking about
 @Project  Unless Ukraine has targeted a country in CSTO in an attack, there is zero justification for Putin invading them.
Its not the Ukraine hes worried aboutIts the western influence a possible Nato Ally and Ukraine being used as a military outpost for the US & UK that hes worried about.This is litterally 2 super powers argument with the kids in the middle (the Ukraine) being fought over.No different than the US telling Russia and Cuba that they cant conduct missiles tests in Cuba because it presents a national security risk to the US.no powerful nation is going to let its adversaries build a stronghold on its border its pretty damn simple concept.Hell the US adopted the Doctrine of Pre-emptive strike in 2006 under Bush Jr allowing the US to take unilateral action against any nation/organization so as to prevent or mitigate a presumed attack by such nations or organizations against the United States. This was so controversial because it stated the US could attack any Nation first as long as it perceived a threat (real or imagined) from that Nation down the line. The Doctrine allows a government to carry out what would be considered a war crime prio to this without having to worry about legal repercussion towards the administration who does it.This is in effect exactly what Putin is doing except i hope atleast this time 110,000 Ukranian lives are NOT lost unlike the 100,000 Civilian deaths caused in Iraq
NATO setting up house in ukraine is an absolute threat. Putin said he is fighting Nazis and that's what the globalist are.
Evil always deny he is evil
 @Jason U  Don't get me wrong, many, many criticisms can be fairly levelled at US (and UK) government, but no one else in this situation (an important point) has invaded another sovereign Western state and started killing civilians. This is not an equivalent to telling Russia they can't carry out military activities close to a border. This is Russia deciding to violently invade its neighbour in a power grab. Feel free to criticise the US on many points, but these two things are not equivalent.
You are not very educated are you ! The threat on Russia is not directly from Ukraine. It’s Ukraine pushing to join NATO . If they do america can put military in Ukraine which puts a strike on Moscow down to just 4 minutes ??
 @mjim21  it was H Clinton that sold huge amounts of uranium to Russia - this is used for nuclear warheads….
 @Daniel Kirkland  I'd really recommend trying to communicate without leading with an insult. You're far more likely to have a receptive audience to what you're saying.
 @Jaycie Victory  oh so you only care about Europe ? Yeah fcuk all the dead civilians killed by America in Syria , Iraq , Libya , Afghanistan Please let us all know how each of these countries was a huge direct threat to America and every day Americans ????
 @Jason U  Remind me when the US launched a full scale military takeover of Cuba? Though either way two wrongs don't make a right...Not to mention the situations/conditions/relationships/people/etc. being completely different. Putin is starting a war that no one else wants, nothing gives him the right to invade other countries.
 @Daniel Kirkland  More LIES FROM THE TRAITORS AT FOXNEWS AND MOSCOW/PUTIN.tRUMP is a TRAITOR
 @Jason U  Two wrongs don’t make a right.  The US’s disastrous invasion of Iraq is no excuse for Russia to do this.
 @will  BS.
 @Daniel Kirkland  Let's say that happened (and that is still a hypothetical), having an ability to make a strike is a potential not an inevitability.  If America carried out an unprovoked attack on Russia they would be a subject to the same sanctions, cold shouldering and censure from allies as Russia is receiving. Whether you believe the US are capable of making an unprovoked attack or not, they have a need to be perceived as not capable of that. So it seems extremely unlikely to me they would take that step unless forced to by circumstance e.g. a first strike from Russia. What Putin has done is not a hypothetical, it's a clear declaration of war on a country that isn't even in NATO. And it's clear the Ukraine are not the de facto members you feel they are as Biden et al aren't responding militaristically as they would if a NATO member had been attacked.
 @Daniel Kirkland  Even if Ukraine joined NATO, that doesn’t mean that US troops (or especially ICBMs that could reach Moscow in 5 minutes as you’re claiming) would be placed in Ukraine.  That’s a bizarre argument.  Because the US “could” do something like what you’re claiming, that somehow justifies an invasion?!  GTFOH!  Putin is full of crap.  This is about two things: Putin wants the USSR’s buffer state empire back and he wants control of the pipelines through Ukraine.  That’s it.  The Ukraine is no threat to Russia; even if they became part of NATO.  If anything, this will just drive Ukraine to join NATO for protection.
 @Jaycie Victory  where is this 'invasion' everyone is talking about? And why noone is learning the details of the whole 8 year conflict? I'm all against any type of conflict, but running around shouting 'Russia invades Ukraine just because they're bored' is just fucked right up. A lot of Russian people have relatives living in Ukraine and vice verse, these used to be very closely related nations, until fascists came, so please, for fucks sake, double-check and study all the shit first
 @OlegBeon  I've watched several interviews this evening of Ukrainian residents whose houses have been hit by bombs and seen footage of tanks rolling in. That is what I am referring to when I say invasion.
 @keir farnum  not telling you how it should be but how it was and how it is.and the US does not  invade sovereign nations?are we just not counting nations with brown skinned people to be sovereign? or is there something im missing here? because that is factually not true... like at all.
 @Daniel Kirkland  You'll notice I made a point of saying 
 @Daniel Kirkland  That’s the equivalent of “well Johnny pulled Suzy’s hair last week!” when a kid in grade school gets in trouble.  Two wrongs don’t make a right.  The fact that neoconservative REPUBLICANS invaded Iraq and created the War on Terror doesn’t justify what Putin is doing now.  It’s widely recognized that the War on Terror was a mistake (if only people had listened to progressives in the first place!) and Americans are no longer in favor of such policies; including even many rank and file Republicans.  The US didn’t use “well Putin invaded Georgia” as an excuse to invade Iraq, did they?
How can Ukraine make a threats to Russia, how can Russia afraid to the threats of Ukraine. Ukraine is not a military power country compare to Russia. The neighboring country of Ukraine should be prepare for who will be the next to occupy.
 @Jaycie Victory  yes but where is it shot? By who? There are indeed troops in 2 independent republics that have been under Ukranian attack for almost 8 years. But where else? Details matter
 @keir farnum  believe what you want. I'm right your wrong,globalist stooge
 @Jaycie Victory  yeah worked great for you didn’t it …
 @mjim21  right and that’s why Russia has done this with Biden lol Do you see how stupid your statement is now ?
 @OlegBeon  There were reporters on the ground with Ukranian skylines/backdrops. There were highly convincing everyday Ukranian ppl crying, and I say highly convincing because they weren't articulate and they weren't all heart plucking i.e. not particularly eye catching or emotive. There was a grinning two year old. If you were creating propaganda you would make sure your toddler was crying or screaming; you would make them look dirty. Every interview would be heartbreaking etc.  It depends how deep you believe conspiracies go. For me, it clearly wasn't propaganda.
 @Jaycie Victory  and what did the governments and everyday civilians do to America from Afghanistan, Iraq , Syria and Libya ????All of which NATO and other countries told America not to invade …..
 @Daniel Kirkland  I don't know which comment you're referring to when you say (I suspect sarcastically) that something worked great for me.
 @keir farnum  so why are US military based in Poland for again ??Yeah of course America would not place military in Ukraine if they could lol Are you crazy ?
 @Daniel Kirkland  RE your second comment about civilians in Afghanistan, Libya etc. at what point have I made any defence of actions that hurt them? I haven't. All I've said, all I am continuing to say, is that nothing justifies Putin's actions in this instance against the Ukranians. I think you are misconstruing a lot of my points and intention.
 @Monty Brown  I remind you the litetal blockade the country suffered and you are right, 2 rights don't make a wrong but they can explain why the wrongs happen.
 @Sahabudin Maddie  This is the real issue and the fundamental reason Poland has sent the most aide, they have seen this playbook before and they know where it ends.Im not saying what Russia is doing is morally right, and two wrongs dont make it right is a grade school analogy, historically its more correct to say SEVERAL WRONGS will eventually make it ok that is how the world we live in is structured.Several wrongs against the Natives eventually in the eyes of those who survived made it right or admissibleSeveral wrongs against the Israelies... which centuries later turned into several wrongs against the PalestiniansSeveral wrongs against the Chinese by the JapaneseSeveral wrongs against the Indians by the Pakistani's and BritsThe list goes on, and at no point did right or wrong make a differencePowerful Nations do what they want, and if they succeed they wash there History so that there children do not think of them as monsters and those children grow up in a world were the sins of the father become the excess's of the son and they only know the world for how it is rather than how it was. This is how it has always happened.young kids in Germany grow up taking pride in how there country is renowned for its engineering and not its holocaustyoung kids in the US grow up taking pride in there nations economic success, military power and opportunity for advancement and not its slavery
 @Jaycie Victory  So basically this BBC video, that's it? I even saw a video of a 
 @OlegBeon  I saw it on both BBC and Channel 4, which are both respectable news outlets and c4, in particular, has a longstanding history of being anti establishment, so the last news outlet I would be inclined to believe to be a state tool for the government. And again, it really wasn't effective as propaganda. I think it's good to critique news and sources, but as I've said I've got no reason to disbelieve in this instance.
 @Jaycie Victory  everywhere I look I see 
 @keir farnum  america is pushing for ukraine to join nato this is pushing this conflict . How did america react to Cuba having Russian military oh yeah they invaded and still to this day decades later block Cuba getting essentials even medical aid !!
 @Jaycie Victory  if Puting wants Ukraine so much, why the fuck did he sign the treaty, why did he wait for 7 years to attack? Russia could take over the Ukraine in a single day, but they're not enemies! The nazis in Ukraine are
 @Jason U  Nato has never 
 @Daniel Kirkland  bro even if they do they would get atomic bombs into Washington back so NATO wouldn't ever bomb or invade Moscow lol you're brainwashed brother ☝️
 @Jaycie Victory  BBC respectable? If you like getting spoon fed propaganda. A gullible population is a real problem
 @will  You'll notice I also talked in detail about channel 4 in my comment, which is known for being anti establishment and is saying the same as the BBC. Though, the funny thing about the BBC is that both the right and the left regularly accuse it of being a propaganda tool for the other side, and it can't be both 💁🏼‍♀️
Arent you a big man in power killing honest civillians with families who just want to live peacefully...i hate you
Project don’t they have the right to choose? Russia should just suck up if they feel their development is under threat
Gngb peace ✌️
@will human life is worthless. We are not groups but just stay together because of convenience and Russia imposing its will on Ukraine is effectively condemning a lot of civilian’s lives whose worth per unit is actually way more than a trashy waste of space and his family with a frigging royal mansion in the middle of nowhere lol
Daniel Kirkland well civilians weren’t… the money grab ideology of the president was wrong and just cuz of a couple crooked ideologies a lot of innocent life was lost
OlegBeon Ukraine is a self sufficient country and Russia is just Russia, it doesn’t matter if crimea is historically important to Russia… they still shouldn’t have started that invasion under false righteousness and pretenses, as all human life has the same exact worth and we are in the end just maggots and frogs at the bottom of a well warring against each other for profit when we don’t even know we aren’t shit in the great scale of things
But you do understand that NATO was already operationing inside the country building up military infrastructure. Which direction do you think they pointed? You think to the west?
 @Lucas Erwell  apparently its 2022 and people still dont know that powerful nations do as they pleaseremember when the UN told the US you cannot go into Iraq? what did the US/UK and france do when American said 
It's not an attack Putin warned them what was going to happen.news station's will make it worse
Pretty clearly, this is one-sided Version of the story, to subvert the covert acts of NATO to encircle Russia.  Why isn't anything said about the number of Eastern European countries that were cajoled to join NATO over the last 20 years or what reservations Russians raised in the UN Security Council, what is the the path of Russian Gas pipeline to Germany or who stands to lose by that, and why is USA involved in the Russian backyard... More specifically, why was it termed Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, while it was indeed the American Missiles that were first to show up in Turkey trained on Russia...?  Since I am from India, we are smart enough to read independent sources of information and not swayed by paid media who constantly portray convenient version of the story.  There is one country in the world, which benefits from wars in all parts of the world, and they strive to ensure there is one every 10 years to keep their arms industry growing - no prizes for guessing, which country it is...
I can't understand just because Ukraine isn't a part of NATO that the United States are not helping them more. They should be there fighting right alongside of them they have the largest military in the world. I just can't understand something like this is happening in the 21st century. Every country in NATO should be ashamed of themselves not backing up Ukraine more this is just not right at all!!! Imagine if this was happening to your country. This just infuriates me so much why is the rest of the world letting this happen?
Wars are fought to kill innocent people. You are sending bombs to babies under the age of one, to the elderly who want to be peaceful in retirement, to parents, to young people in education, to innocent birds on the street, and to trees.Putin and leaders like him are unscrupulous, evil and ruthless people. These people have no feelings of pity or empathy. It lacks human feelings. That's why they fight. You are a devil, Putin. And I hope one day your soul burns for hurting innocent people.
Another devil 😈 is PutinUkraine we all with you The whole world will support youDon't give up be strong
Oh yeah 100 000 troops doing military drills at the border for weeks prior was not suspicious at all?
We should have done something to help Ukraine
President Vladimir Putin is a very wise and stable leader. The world has to stop underestimating President Vladimir Putin and taking his kindness for weakness. They have awakened a sleeping GIANT 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Нато завадио али није завладао.
How can the people just watch these tanks go by..im not gonna sit by and watch my country get invaded...pussies
What a mess. Western diplomacy is non existent. We could have helped Ukraine avoide this. Imo.
NO word of the suffering of people under shelling for the last 8 years??!!
Americans and westerners are bloody cowards…..imagine they inflated Ukrainian with false hope but when they reality came….. instead of helping them! I heard sanction hahahhahahahaha
Just wonder where were the Ukrainian airforce and air defence. Could have shoot down the attacking planes and rockets. Any other country would counter such attacks.
Hope Russia take aver ucrania soon so this is over this conflict is been for more then ten years and nobody do anything this are Russian people they want to go back to Russia or independent. That's there problem  not ours.
What are people going to achieve fighting each other?
К черту Россию
Assad and Putin: get out of Syria America, you're not welcomed here.America : NoPutin: fine
Keep praying for the neo natzis in Ukraine you sheep’s have no idea the actual citizens arnt being touched and the majority of them are Russian
👍
With this war going on, BBC and other western mainstream media are so happy and WION too. Their bias reporting, and adding fuel to the fire narratives really have come unto fruition.
When two gaint  elephants fight ,its the grass that suffer
Putin is full of lies! Nato must fight.
All I see is prayers & praying for you.....do you even believe in God!
Ww3 time boys
Hahaha. Lets goooo.
>>>>>>NAZISM IS ALIVE AND WELL AGAIN               LED BY THE RUSKI  
Dang we all gon die now. WWIII

Putin is the evil of the whole planet
the world is watching this? unite and stop them.
What’s really the motivation here
Ok this sht will not gonna end well... be safe ukraine brothers and sisters ... may the thriple gem bless u guys 🇱🇰
So it has started hasnt it world war 3 huh ?
Prayers to the civilians 🙏🏻 no one wants war
This is so unnecessary and should not be happening in this century
They're attacking the people why doesn't these Allies react ffs!!!
In Australia protests end like that, in Canada protests end like that.
Damn bro putin just used the Poland attacking a German radio station excuse
Do they still have to Social Distance in the bunkers?
🇳🇿🇭🇲🇨🇦🇬🇧🇮🇳🇩🇪🇫🇷🇮🇹🇺🇲🇰🇷🇺🇦
No sanctions will wake the dead people alive
God please help! We need your help!
Nonesense
Shame on Nato for causing this unecessary war by attempting to surround Russia with western influenced borders. Vladimir Putin is doing his job protecting Russia. Its not Russia that wants to destry Ukraine its Nato who manourvered to inlist the Ukraine to intimidate Russia. Dont  attempt to cage a bear then complain when it bites you!
yea let's call jewish ppl nazis yea who the real nazi here?
2:38 nice mustang though
You will get yours,putin!
Politicians beat the drum of war and innocent civilians pay the price with their lives!
Putin feels Zalensky and Ukraine being pro West and Democratic is Naziism?Paranoid Putin is attacking a country because he feels threatened that they will join NATO. Then Putin is threatening nuclear war if the US gets involved.  He's effing crazy.
This is unreal...
Another Hitler he must be stopped and he will with our resolve
The world wasn’t like that when Donald Trump as US President.
23/12/1979 was AfghanistanToday Ukraine turn
My heart goes out to all Russian casualties over the many years of bombardment into Lugansk and Donbas.
Putin membuat perjalanan hidup manusia untuk menjadi releven dan adil..  rusia itu lagi baik dari negara nato yang banyak penting kan diri masing masing..  good luck russia president putin.... dunia percaya kamu kuat kerna bermoral ..
Wait, wait! That's not what public says 
Wasn't the United Nations created to stop this type of war? Its pretty sad to think that Putin is essentially able to do what he pleases in Ukraine while the rest of the world makes statements of support, but little else.
USSA PROVOKOVALO A SPOLU S EU TLAČILI NA RUSO, ZASTRAŠOVALI, SANKCE , SANKCE A POŘÁD  RUKO JE ZLO V PROLHANÉM MAINSTREAMU. CO SI MYSLELI, ŽE SE Z NICH VŠECH RUSKO PO**RE ANI OMYLEM.

I Hope Russia gets drawn into a nightmare
My heart goes out for Ukrainians! war is not a solution to anything.But now all who are watching, take a moment and think...this is what people of Afghanistan and Iraq has to go through for 20 years when US boomed them and destroyed them!
Fake news
ohh look, how crisp the resolutions are .look how well the coverage is.. HMMM
This is literally the government’s fighting… no citizens from either side agree with this war!
Holocaust survivors calling on the rest of the world to act and not just hand out sanctions speaks volumes against Putin's so called 
Biden stated that putin attack on imminent and putin replied that it is a lie and not going to invade. Guess putin lied. Now Russians fight for a liar.
My heart seriously goes out to the Ukrainian People.. you all don't deserve this...
This is definitely not happening for no reason and I'm certain that no one is in the position to say anything about both sides without having the knowledge of its historical conflicts that causes this sad event.
How ..in the NAME OF JESUS DOES putin sleep
All them cringe Russian fan girl b1tch boys saying Russia wouldn't invade have all gone quiet now
This never would have happened If trump was still in power
show civilians how to use javelin missile units,and pass the AK´s around
This is so horrible and sad. My heart and prayers to all those people in the Ukraine. They don’t deserve that, they are losing their homes, personal belongings and lives. Putin needs to be stopped if not I don’t believe he will stop with Ukraine. I believe he will go on to other countries like Hitler and cause WW3! Other countries need to step up and stop him because he’s nothing but a tyrant. God bless all those who have been effected and lost their lives. I pray that no more civilians who are not fighting and children die because of this senseless act of violence!
he called the west bluff with all there build up. he know they don't want them problems. if not met with force he will continue into NATO territory, I mean why not? he's been studing the west for decades and built up as the west has been in Middle East for 20 years $20T spent 0 accomplishments.
Give Russia a new Afghanistan
Trump/biden have close to nothing to do to this. Self centered american
Zelensky overthrew a democratically elected representative in those autonomous regions in line with the Minsk agreement as well as burnt the parliament prior to all this, and now he fears for his job. Sounds like karma 😂🤦‍♂️.
Ukrainian people amaze me with the level of their strength, keeping themselves together while they are going through this atrocity. My hearts goes out to the people of Ukraine.
Putin is pulling a George W. Bush. Attacking a nation that did nothing to deserve this. And you saw how that ended for the US.
And yet Boris the Question Dodger is in the pockets of the Russians and will do nothing to deter Putin.
If it were my country I will wait for enemy and die fighting instead of running
The Question is .. BBC was in deep sleep when USA invaded Iraq, Syria , Lybia and Afghanistan ..... ?
Don't let government's make decisions for you.
If Nato and America doesn't help the Ukrainians it will prove they are afraid of Putin!
What has happened to make Putin decide to do this? Is he terminally ill or going senile. There is never going t be anyway back for Russia now. God bless all of the brave Ukrainian people and their army.
Only if Ukraine listened, where is the west now ? Exactly where is the Nato that has been giving them arms and talking a lots ? Putin has now proven to Ukrainians that they are aligning themselves with the wrong untrusted friends.
Ukraine didn't have troops on the borders in an attempt to slow them down?
Mr putin you are a disgrace sir,you want to invade Ukraine just because you said so...
This tyrant needs to be stopped. At this stage..you can't fight bullets with words. Ukraine needs military support. Fighting for freedom of these people. History will look back and say who stood for good/truth. They need support now.
I’m so sorry Ukraine
Time to call up all of Ukraine reserves .The gloves r off , this is a fight for your survival , independence and a democratic landscape
USA...I'm waiting for you
Come stay in South Africa
I feel bad. But why was the Ukrainians provoking Putin. Should a left him alone. Man this is sad.
As a Russian I now say death to Moscow and its Regime
My family is a boxing family with Mexican blood. Respect to Ukrainian fighters is most hight. They have as much heart as any Mexican fighter, and are creative and usually very strong. Bless the people of Ukraine.
Ukrainians don’t have fair elections. Their president silences critics and journalists. They don’t represent any of America’s values or morals. They’re even more corrupt than Mexico. I feel bad for the people but they are being ruled by tyrants
Not yet. Must show something positive on the battlefield
Which ones exactly amaze you: the western or the eastern ones?
Rumchata why do you think this? And where do you base this on? What are your sources? Ukraine is democracy and even if it's bad democracy it's still democracy and it's hell of a better than being under foreign rule
 @Rumchata  and who is Russia being ruled by? You sound crazy Putin way worse
 @Darth Sidius  It’s civil war started over them overthrowing their democratically elected presidents 😂. We can at least agree that it doesn’t represent western democracy and values. They made it a law you are forced to speak Ukrainian. That goes against our god given rights. But in Europe they don’t believe in freedom like in America. So because they don’t believe in what we do, we can’t go and sacrifice ourselves for a lost cause
 @Shundai  way worst how? You think the Ukrainian president is a saint? All those politicians are trash scum people. Even if putin is worst what you expect Americans to go die for a corrupt country that don’t share our values? Good luck trying to convince weak liberals to enlist and fight their virtue wars
 @Rumchata  shut up pls cuz many innocent people in Ukraine Russia doesn't care so beware Russia will fall
 @Noland Ryan  I really feel for Oleksander Usyk
 @Rumchata  well Americans went to Germany . With plenty of Americans lost. America doesn't have a yellow streak. Just a  caution light. Never underestimate and American we've fault for freedoms sence the beginning. Our on governments don't understand the people and what we expect for freedoms we desire what we fault for to begin with all governments will chew at your freedoms . Never the less we stand by them on or shores and abroad for the fight for freedoms even if it's not our on freedoms. We like the ring it has to it. FREEDOM so we want everyone to have a taste .  I think the whole dam country would load up go support Ukraine if ask . Chicken ain't nothing but a bird . That's why we like eagles they soar with thier freedoms.
Rumchata a coalition should always fight by their Allies… ur country is just as bad or good as any other country geographically located in this world. Just an agglomeration of letters can make ppl feel proud cuz they part of something bigger than them? Us uk europe china these words are meaningless if there are no citizens living in them
 @Rumchata  more of a tyrant than Putin? Who kills political enemies and journalists? Ukraine is a democracy, a small country who is attacked by authoritarian fascists from the east. Get real.
Which Ukrainians are you talking about, the ethnic russians in Donbass (Ukraine) that have been fired at for 8 years by the ukrainian army and slowly starved to death by cutting power, water, food supplies, financial services? Or the ukrainian army firing at them?
 @Lucas Erwell  tell them to go Home. If you gonna be in some one else's country play by thier rules
 @Home steading Tennessee river  if Russia done that you would be crying saying it is unfair stfu go to bed
TOYOTA Driver Lives Matter 💯 -Scotty Kilmer
Your heart better go to Palestinians or Iraqis
NATO should NUKE russia before its too late, this is just the start of world domination
Really boy  ... dat is stupidity
 @Hairy Rokeke  that is precisely how the world would end.. Russia and their allies would lead to nuking NATO countries in which NATO would react with more nukes on Russian allies.
:(
NW BBC u say people day American killing people everyday no one say any things in this world do you think those people killing in Iraq ,libiya ,Afghanistan are not human ?y American u are not start war in your home country
1:02 it's FAKE!
All world leaders are idiots and its time for the people of the world to rise up against there government's before its to late.
The Rusdian people ARE NOT INNOCENT IN THIS. Stand up against your Tortalian Dictator 
Stay strong my dear friends in Ukraine. If this is going to be a war the world is behind you. Love from Iran 🇺🇦 ❤
Skoro kao u Srbiji 1999. 72 dana bombardovani su srpski gradovi. Gorele su bolnice i porodilista..Zasto? Da bi se otela  nasa sveta zemlja! Ovo je pocetak kraja, sada necete gledati samo, svaka zemlja ce imati svoje Kosovo! Kosovo ce se kao bumerang vratiti Evropi
GOD BLESS UKRAINE!!
Why would Russia do this? They are already so poor.. The country has no thriving economy.. why make it worse? Unless maybe because you have a strong Chinese CCP friend….
Sick of world leaders forcing us all into wars we don't want.
All TV screens are fixated on Kyiv since last night, but I don’t see any explosion, fireworks, or buildings blown up. Very disappointed. News media really need to have split screens showing shock and awe when live shots of air strikes raining on Baghdad.
If the airport is destroyed, how are the international travellers going to get out ?
clicked by mistake B.B.C. is Fake News
The 'west' doesn't know who Vladimir Putin is, nor the true story of Russia.It is a very big mistake to engage with or threaten Russia, and it's military commander Putin.Vladimir putin is a military commander, of the order of mussolini. Joe Biden is speaking for the USA, as it's president, but his words and voice have a huge impact on the outcome of this conflict. He doesn't seem to understand this. He is not fit to go to war with Russia..he is not a military man  able to stand against putin. Neither is Boris Johnson.The outcomes of wars...sometimes hinge on one man...if he is a strategic genius, like putin. At the same time, he has a frightening amount of military power and preparation.The regional war that is going on, between Russia and the Ukraine, has some very complex and dangerous characters and armies in it, over there...in that region. Putin knows them. The West doesn't.I don't know how to more strongly suggest that all those not understanding the conflict, back down or pull out as fast as possible.Mr Vladimir Putin...in a nutshell:1. Has a frightening history inside the KGB...and it never left russia. You are at war with the entire remnants of the KGB, and these are not local to Russia. These men and women of the KGB are not only in Russia. They are in many camps in the region too..and elsewhere in the 'West' and East. You can't fight that enemy...with weapons of war that fire rockets and drop bombs. The biggest danger is economic war with Russia. You don't have the information...or spread that putin does.2. Putin does not wish to go to war with the world...nor even with the Ukraine. Inside Russia, separatists from many parts of the region, and terror groups, are taking hold. He has no choice, and I would do the same in his shoes, no matter what the west threw at me. He knows his military brilliance and power.3. Putin is a man who follows through, as is his army and generals. You won't scare him...1st mistake. Biden and Johnson...that's your first major blunder.4. You are misunderstanding Chechnya, you are misunderstanding Belarus, you are misunderstanding Croatia, you are misunderstanding Poland, you are misunderstanding Iran, you are misunderstanding Syria, you are misunderstanding north Korea, you are misunderstanding Burma, you are misunderstanding Israel, you are misunderstanding Egypt. 5. Your biggest misunderstanding is the Ukraine....putin has huge support inside the Ukraine...and armies inside the Ukraine...KGB built...historically.6. Your biggest problem....please understand, is that putin is a very very very dangerous military and economic tactician. Biden and Johnson are not up to this one....please trust me.I have more to say, but I won't for now...except that my advice is that you treat it as a regional conflict, and pull back until you understand the problem better!!!
Blame Biden
Fake news, no Russian tanks in Kiev .
Once again the uk govt is dilly dallying ooooo sanctions (eventually)  when Russian oligarchs  stop giving boris and Co dosh.
This is absolutely disgusting, I feel sorry for all civilians
Come on Russia🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
Trump loves Putin.
Russia ❤️
This is just the start you haven't seen there main alley China who are nicely funded by Covid
Now I know why china has been trying to create a infantry near india
It would be WWIII.
1:43 de-nazification
Perhaps the Russian people will rise up against putin and his cronies if they rearly don't want this war
those civilian look so coward instead of fighting back they are running
When USA and NATO bombarded Serbia and give endependds Kosovo that was ok for All Europe. Ukraine citizens don't give lifes for USA end NATO intreses just Serended and be with Russia. Slaves again Slaves that Evrope wonet. USA is destroy  Yugoslavia, Iraq, Libya and many other in the name of Democratia. Now is over. Go Putin go. England deserve nuclear bomb for all history evils.
Ww3 gonna be litt
I hope Russia Nukes Londonistan
Praying for Ukraine 🙏🙏🇺🇦🇺🇦😢😢
I hope this will end in near future 🇷🇴🇺🇦Romania will be with u Ukraine
God help us all🙏
I like how black presenter says - denacify THIS country 😂😂😂😂 Astonishing isn't it?
World war 3 in the Makeing
I can't believe people actually believed Putin
imagine breaking into someone's house, massacring the family and looting their stuff, and then telling the judge it was 
Against a missle launched from miles away. Right.
DJPlease let me know what you think..https://youtu.be/Vs_dtMCwSyM
This
I mean that would fly in America
Perhaps read up on some history and geopolitics first. The west has created this situation. I don't approve russia's actions but russia does have a point and did warn the west this would happen for quite some time. Its like the cuba missile crises but in reverse with NATO/USA being the ones threatening russia's borders. Ukraine is just in the bad position of being in the middle and will suffer the most because of it. If we really want to blame someone, we should blame the people at NATO for being as blind and incompetent as they are if this was not something they may actually have wanted to happen.
Analogy was crap do sum research
He said he was fighting Nazis. Y'all said they were everywhere, soooo...
That’s literally what Israel is doing
 @Justsomeguy  wow now we are the baddies
 @Mutiny On The Bounty  I mean, it's not wrong to say there's Neo nazis in ukraine but not enough to start a war in my opinion.
 @Zoli Makky  Both you and Russia are baddies, everyone else is a victim or a vassal.
This is what happend in Georgia 2008 they came took our lands burned our houses looted everything they found.... and putin called them peacekeepers ....i dont think peacekeepers are burning houses looting people and occuping a countrys land
 @Agent C  the problem is that the small percentage of neo nazis are now a paramilitary organisation with advanced weaponsThese guys probably shelledtheir own civilians to blame russiaI wouldnt put it past themRussia took out isis from the air and im pretty sure there werent many civilian casualties
Here is an interesting watch that would enlighten you all on this situation. Note how this video is from 2015. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrMiSQAGOS4 It starts arround 2 min mark and end after 45 ish mins, after that are some questions.
 @Zoli Makky  You have always been baddies, you've bombed SO MANY COUNTRIES in the past 20 years
 @Agent C  I mean Ukraine was the one who wanted to join NATO
 @Ana  I think there is no goodies in this world by now and now I sound like a super villain :P
To the innocence on both sides  be safe
Thank selensky for war,they attacked firts
Ukraine must hit Russia in Russia .
In Poland we knew that from years about Putin - Putler. The Western world doesn't want to hear Poles. We know Russions as own shirt. Now all you see.
When UK was with USA attacking Irak . . When UK planned to attach  Syria ...We remember
Ukraine is joining NATO and we're parking our nukes there !   
Poetin must lokt op he is onder drugs.
Putin is the next hitler
Please stop this 🥺💔
God bless America I’m worried a little bit 💔
European they must feel how people suffered they kill civilian in Afghanistan in iraq in Syria. Now Europe more years Putin 🙏
Hard times create strong men, strong men create good times, good times create weak men, weak men create hard times. History repeats itself and now we are here again.
All the Marvel and DC movies and earth has no hero's to protect them. This is sad 😥
Sending prayers from Ireland to the Ukrainian people 🙏

Seems zelensky needs new job
Corona is real btw
other than being a complete dick does anyone know why Putin is doing this?
He said vast Country, Ukraine is not a Country. God bless all involved.
what a shame of news , do not believe in this
God bless Russia
Unknown person talking about family function 😜
I won't praise Russia actions, but let's stop pretending like NATO and the US are saints. Look what they did to Iraq and Libya, or how they bombed Belgrade. And of course they would make up with excuses for doing those wars, just like the Russians make excuses. There is no difference. The only difference is Russia is regional imperialism, while USA is global imperialism. Russia is ruled by oligarchs and Putin close friends. The west is ruled by a conglomerate of corporations and angloamerican elites who are playing world domination and want to make all countried into indirect vassals, like what is now Germany and Japan. The same way Russia behaves with Ukraine and China with Taiwan. It's the exact same power hungry behaviour. And if you really think the western one is justified because 
If NATO doesn’t step up and calm the quarrel then any country, including America, can do what they want with any state of their choosing… Condolences out to both sides who will be harmed though they don’t have a choice… All eyes are on Russia…
Dont bomb Chernobyl then we all are screwed all europe :(
Something smells very funny about this invasion
You need power, only when you want to do something harmful, otherwise love is enough to get everything done
Russia doing what Russia always does. Do not trust Vladolfmir Putler. The greatest threat to peace and sovereignty in Europe.
Hear me out here. Not fact but there are a few disturbing coincidences going on right now. Putin's puppet in America (trump) and Britian (prince) are having their miss deeds grow daily. All 3 were connected to Epstein and some how the one who could connect them. 
I had a dream once  that world War 3 will start in Russia.
This is all very deja vu, self defence, historically Russian my god the same old excuse to invade and murder to steal other peoples land and wealth What next China invading it’s neighbours In this day and age we have learned nothing Greed is greed and murder is murder
I feel sorry for innocent people. But here Ukraine started the conflict. Now the government is playing the victim!!!! They united with the USA and put their own people in danger.
Utterly shameful. Stay strong, Ukraine. I have been so impressed by the bravery and strength of Ukrainians. Thinking of you all and sending love 💗.
Shame to Putin.
What happened to the volunteer civilians that said they would die for their country while defending off russians
Firstly, let's all be honest. None of you knew anything about the Ukraine or its political landscape until five seconds ago.rrSecondly, the political scene in the Ukraine has been dominated by Far Right/White Supremacist groups like Svoboda and corrupt foreign business elements (Like the Biden's) syphoning off millions of dollars, for years. The Ukraine has been a failed state for some time, like a rotten apple, it looked good on the outside, but was black and toxic in the middle.rrLastly, Putin is fighting Fascism and Neo Nazism - so if you stand against Russia but for the Ukraine, then you are supporting White Supremacy and Neo Nazism in the Ukraine. I thought we were against White Supremacy?
My Country Canada fell apart from a Trucker protest 😆
Putin is a liar.
Wait a second had World War 3 started already? OMG
NATO is pointless.  If Trump were in office, no way this shit would be going on.
Death to UKraine nazis they would get what they deserve
WHY IS THERE NO COMMENTS WHEN ISRAEL BOMBS PALESTINE, AND AMERICA BOMBS OTHER COUNTRIES. WHY NOW?
I know this is  will be hard to people 😪 but I think this thing is not a good thing for a world
Why is it that the innocent civilians caught in the middle of WARS between Political SCUMBAGS from Countries invading other countries or starting WARS, always have to be the unfortunate casualties. These leaders and presidents as well any other political people involved should fight amongst each other and leave the civilians out of it.
It's ironic how NATO & US could bomb Serbia and attempt to make a fake country out of a historic & culturally significant Kosovo because Serbia was a weak country deemed as aggressors in their own region and territory because NATO wanted more influence in the region. But now when Putin does the exact same thing in an act of defense from NATO and the US in historically Russian territory he's the bad guy smh...Ukraine has only existed since 91 & the fall of the Soviet Union because of NATO's success in the region during the Cold War.Odessa itself has been was strategic Russian Naval Fortress founded by Catherine the Great in 1794.
Where the fook is Nato and US?? Help the Ukrainians!!!!
America this what the want to sale boom america always like  fighting america are killer killing Iraq ,Afghanistan ,libiya
So Incredibly Sad.....those airaid sirens, send shivers up my spine. I am so gutted for the civilians there, Let People Be Protected At All Times. Thinking of you all 😔💜
Welcome back to Russia
I'm from russia, i'm ashamed of what my country's goverment doing to my motherland and motherlands of the other countries (in this year is ukraine).All i wanted at least a normal, civil and calm life. I'm still a child(that is also a reason why i can't leave my country) that don't want to die in fires of a war that is shining on the horizon.I think this is absurd, ukraine people and russian people surely didn't want all this to happen.All i want to wish to ukraine civilians is staying safe, with health and everything okay. Also wish to everyone: good luck.
#PRAYFORUKRAINE 🇺🇦 #SAVEUKRAINE 🇺🇦
How can this still happen? Can’t get it
Fake news
BBC is next.
Putin strives for the sheep to cower yet there's wolves among them.
No, actually he is right
Do something America
I feel worry for the civilians.Sending prayers to Ukraine.
Sadam Hussein thought he is Untouchable but he ended hidding himself 500 metters in Hole 😂I think this Macho Putin may be eaten by his own People soon !
Don't expect NATO or America to help, this is all by design.  People knew this was coming, they are surrounded, so wait till attacked before evacuating?  Stupid people.
this why aliens stay away from us
In no war civilians were taken into account. And stop talking about God: it doesnt exist.
This 🤕 my heart ❤️ God 🙏 help us 🙏 We  need love not Hate
不公義，殘暴地發動戰爭。普京判斷完全錯誤。對全球影響深遠。
Explosions from Ukrainians themselves
https://youtu.be/H8-3JQcKWkg
We can blame Germany, and the EU, for causing billions of lost dollars in Russian resources by scrapping Nord Stream 2 and not having the guts to stand up to the U.S. More war crimes by the global empire, it's a disgrace.
Damn I used to like Putin but this is so evil
Lets remember people of Donbas! The south-eastern region of Ukraine! They refused to support state revolt in Ukraine in 2014 and got a war! They were bombed 8 years EVERY DAY by ukrainian army!!! Many women and children were killed there! WHY DON'T YOU CRY FOR THEM??? Now Putin will stop that genocide!
For 7 years the Ukrainian army bombed the Donbass at least 40,000 have died, sad but true Russia has invaded to protect the Russian speaking population in the east. Putin talks of Nazi, well check out the Azov battalion,s Andriy Parubiy a radical neo Nazi.
US intelligence warned over the last couple weeks that invasion was imminent... euros all downplayed it. Think the Americans know a little more about fighting the the Soviets/Russians during the Cold War.
Russia don't want nato on their doorstep, I don't blame them for fighting back!
Should have let the Russians athlete take steroid and participate in the Olympic. This crisis wouldn't happen
Grab a rifle and take a post.
People are trying to hide and this dickhead news reporter put on the news where theyre hiding for safety...
Putin doesn't play games! and just like the US did to Vietnam when they wanted to be communist, even though Vietnam was half the world away from US borders, in the case of Ukraine, it's on the borders of Russia, and Russia can't allow them to ally with its enemies!
Fake usa leaders, fake people in Europe and all over the World.You all provocate Russsia too far.So shut up now.Long live Russia!🇷🇺♥️👍
FUCK RUSSIA
World leaders cannot stop this without risking WWIII. Only the people of Russia can impose their will on Putin to stop the blood shed.
Why UN do anything and where is world leader .
Fight is not good in war many peoples and children will dead close completely 😷
Please.. make it stop.. this is the start of ww2 all over again..
I can't believe he says this is in 
Ok so let me get this right, when US invades Kuwait or Afghanistan and kills hundreds of thousands its all good but if Russia does this its a war crime. How exactly does this work?
Russia and China makeing moves.
War is a racket
This will end with nukes being dropped God save us!
Where is the peace keepers sleeping turning a blind eye
I wonder why Russians and Serbians always want war !?😏Not able to live alone ?
Putin said he wouldn’t invade Georgia, then he did, he said he wouldn’t integrate Crimea, then he did, he said he wouldn’t invade Ukraine, now he is. We shouldn’t trust this boiled egg anymore!
Putin think he is powerful or immortal..he forgot he will also loss everything if this war is not stopped
Please stop this madness....🥺 my heart goes out to all the innocent people of Ukraine from india 🇮🇳🙏🙏🙏
Putin is Hitler today! We did nothing to russians. Nothing!!!  I am proud of Ukrainians!!! I am proud to be Ukrainian!!! Ukrainian people are fighting for their freedom!!!
How can you do harm to a neighboring country, they have good people and kids there, why can't the Kremlin see this.
To all u people who can't believe this is happening. With out sounding mean. Where have yall been. We have been blowing up the middle east for years. Killing hundreds of thousands innocent people. glad everyone is waking up.  I have to side with Putin. Ukraine don't need EU and NATO. THEY WORK FOR THE RICHES PEOPLE IN THE WORLD AND DO THEIR DIRTY WORK TO GIVE THEM MORE POWER. NWO IS THE GAME THEY ARE PLAYING. Please research nato and EU before getting mad at me. They are not working for the people.   If Putin really wanted to hurt those people. He could have already taken out thousands of them.
Does anybody still believe the BBC lol
So said please be United
Oh no.
NATO is literally a paper tiger right now. Unable to deliver the promises they made to Ukraine. The Us issue sanctions that can't stop bullets or bombs
they cant drive
This is heartbreaking 💔💔💔Russian troops have taken over the Nuk buildings. Pathetic behaviors from Putin! Sending love, prayers and hugs to all Ukraine's! Moldova is under a State of Emergency for 60 days to get the Ukraine families out! They have set up emergency camps. All their boarders are open. 🇺🇦🙏❤️🇨🇦
Shit my grandma and grandad live in Kharkov 😭

Still baffles me why innocent people have to die to prove a point
This is really scary 😟
Ukraine president is one of the weakest politician ever to rose to a public platform
Slava Ukraini, Glory to Ukraine
They must be the weakest missiles that I have ever seen 😂 looks more like American's spy's starting forest fires and throwing grenade's around the place.
The hypocrisy of the west is unbelievable! We've literally bombed the shit out of anyone who've have the ordacity to disagree with us! Meanwhile, never dealing with the issues at home! 🤔
My heart breaks for the people of Ukraine. I hope they can stay safe and strong  🇺🇦 ❤ 🇬🇧
For Russia !!
а 8 лет назад сердце не разбивалось за  убийство мирных жителей украиной?
You support Azov Nazis. Ukraines nationalists.
 @Follower of The Old Ones  thanks for the Russian propaganda
 @Lunar Eclipse  So Azov is just a myth? They’ve been killing ethnic Russians for years. You can’t even speak Russian in Ukraine or else they will use violence against you. Tell me this is a lie since you know so much about what’s been going on for years in Ukraine.
Did your heart break for afghanistan, iraq, etc?
 @Follower of The Old Ones  yes those nazis exist just like the Russian ones. How does that justify the invasion and overtake of Ukraine? The fact that PUTIN HIMSELF GAVE YOU A BLOOD AND SOIL REASON AS TO WHY HE IS INVADING  and you believe that putin REALLY cares.about stomping out  nazis when his own far right Rouge extremist groups that do what russia tells them to do are just  that
 @Brooke Whittle  you sound like a crybaby
 @Lunar Eclipse  Russia doesn’t let them serve in their military unlike Ukraine. Ukraine is perfectly fine with white nationals fighting for them. The previous president was seen doing the Nazi salute in the Kiev. Putin is getting rid of those racists. If you want to support Neo Nazis be my guest. I sure as hell won’t 🤷🏽‍♂️
 @Follower of The Old Ones  russia lets them in.Hell they fund their own extremists groups!.I don't know how neo nazi.you can get by using blood and soil Arguments (just like Hitler did) to overtake a whole sovereign country because they have extremists groups that you also have within your own military.And again your idiotic if you think putin being the fascist dictator he is he gives a wet dog's  damn about Nazis again he told you why he invaded and it had nothing to do with Nazis it's about restoring territory that he lost that they think belongs to him it's nothing but a land grab.Another make Russia Great again.Like I said thanks for your russian propaganda
 @Follower of The Old Ones  and ignoring the fact that he out his.own mouth he said wants to restore russia soviet  union territory (that extends out to Poland and even sweden) what's the excuse gonna be then? When They try to push this pass Ukraine
 @Lunar Eclipse  He said he wants Ukraine as well as wants to denazify the country. Are you missing the blatant fact that there are Neo Nazis in Ukraine who openly spew their hateful rhetoric and that are in their military? Who cares if he’s taking Ukraine you or me can’t do jack shit. He is his own person. A great leader at that. He takes no shit. Unlike sleepy Joe. Now color me surprised that you care more about Putin than literal Neo Nazis 🤦🏽‍♂️. It’s clear to me you have no issue with Nazis otherwise you wouldn’t be giving a good god damn about Putin.
 @Lunar Eclipse  Fyi Russia was already great smart ass. Not once did he say he wants to restore the USSR. He said anyone that tries is stupid.
 @Follower of The Old Ones  what? Everyone can speak russian or any other language in Ukraine! Hello. I am ukrainian, I am crimean! I was born in Crimea  (that part that russia occupied) and grew up there. And I am ukrainian, never had problem to speak russian in Ukraine. Like at all. A lot of Soldiers now who fight against russia speak russian language. But hey, thank you, russia for saving me, ukrainian from my own ukrainian country(((( Putin is A murderer and liar
 @стас орлов  THE MERCENARY Brutal Martial Arts action now on streaming and Amazon Prime
 @Turtlemilk -  THE MERCENARY Brutal Martial Arts action now on streaming and Amazon Prime
 @Lena cy  Мне жаль, что вам пришлось пройти через это. Что ты думаешь об Азове?
 @Follower of The Old Ones  THE MERCENARY Brutal Martial Arts action now on streaming and Amazon Prime
​ @Follower of The Old Ones  а что не так с Азовом? Я удивляюсь людям, 8 лет путин вешает лапшу на уши, что это Украина войну затеяла и люди верят. А Что сейчас россия делает!( Я родилась в Крыму , я жила себе спокойно , я ездила везде по Украине и никогда не было проблем с русским. Я путина в Крым не звала. Я украинка, Россия для меня - чужая страна, сосед. Путин этого не понимает. Вы думаете, что украинцы ждут россию? так думает путин. Россияне для меня чужие люди. Соседи, но не братья. Сколько можно верить обманам? Почему не оставить просто в покое Украину и не лезть? Сам сидит у власти сколько лет, а россии разруха и нищета, только Москва и Питер хорошо живут. И выехать в глубинку - туалеты на улицах и канализации нет. И к соседям лезут права качать.
 @Lena cy  Я знаю, что у Путина были свои проблемы. Он не делал ужасных вещей и выбил многих людей из своих домов и вызвал абсурдное количество смертей. Я думаю, что он ошибается в этом. Но он сказал, что избавляется от азовских нацистов. Он собирается «деназифицировать» Украину. Что украинцы думают о батальоне «Азов»?
🇬🇧👞
 @Brooke Whittle  yes, it did. just because I'm British, doesn't mean I agree with war. People need to realise that its not the people of these countries, it's the leaders that want war
Does this include the ethnic russians in Donbass (Ukraine) that have been fired at for 8 years by the ukrainian army and slowly starved to death by cutting power, water, food supplies, financial services? Of course western media did not report about that, but it's the hard reality on the ground.
for all those arguing over politics.. you need to see that it's innocent people being hurt. that's who we, in the comments, are sad for. we just want peace for everyone. stop fighting each other and fight for peace, its the only way
 @Follower of The Old Ones  are the children nazis? you're referring to a minority, I refer to the good and honest  people of Ukraine. don't tar everyone with the same brush, my friend. that shit can turn people bitter.
 @Lucas Erwell  Nobody wants to talk about Donbass 🤷🏽‍♂️
 @Lucas Erwell  I would not wish harm on innocent people. I don't live there so I will never fully understand, But I do know that there are over 100 people dead and not all people of the Ukraine are these monsters you write of. the good ones are the ones I feel for, my friend.
 @lifeonmars 10  You’re right. It’s wrong to say that but I can’t help it when the Ukrainian government openly allows these Neo Nazis to freely operate in their country spewing racist nonsense and imitating Hitlers regime. It’s nonetheless sad that civilians are getting caught up in this.
 @Follower of The Old Ones  that's okay, I can see where you are coming from. I will never fully understand but I recognise the media let you see what they want you to see. I just think of the poor families caught up in it all. I hope you and yours are well ❤
 @Follower of The Old Ones  you've been watching too much RT news XD
Heart breaks for fuckin nato.
Putin and his war mongering, glory days of soviet chasing dreams, killing and starving his own Russian people, is bombing innocent Ukrainian civilians, but claims Ukraine acted first but refuses to show proof other then saying to believe his words with no proof. Then calls Ukraine neo nazis after using military tactics like Hitler did. 🖕Putin, and 🖕 Putins Supporters. Much love to the poor Russian people who hate Poutine.
 @lifeonmars 10  Yeah most of the media are biased and tell lies but that’s just how they are. Me and my family are doing well. Hope yours are doing okay!
 @Robert Leduc  And where do you get your news from? If I may ask.
 @Zmaj Ognjeni  to assume makes an ass out of u and me. Don't assume I agree with NATO or any of this palava. thank you.
 @Follower of The Old Ones  good to see. I'm good but my relative has cancer and it's a tough time but spending as much time with them as I can. You can never put a price on time or memories can you 😊 take care x
Because America and nato are the destroyers of this war, look at what has happened before, America is a coward who dares to attack, America is the destroyer of this world, facts, Read the history first. Ukraine used to be, what in Ukraine were mostly ethnic Russians, Russia had to protect its people from western Europeans, Mamarika and Natos
 @lifeonmars 10  this is a war between russia and america (west) and the ukrainian people are the victims
 @lifeonmars 10  I’m sorry to hear that. I hope they get better if they can! You take care of yourself ☺️
Thanks for this live mars.
 @Follower of The Old Ones  sorry i dont understood you. Azov kills russians so where is problem?
 @Zmaj Ognjeni  you know what, I just want everyone to have time to gather themselves after 2 years of a shite pandemic. we all need to rest and take care of ourselves and each other. we don't need war, we need a world party and good times. friends between all nations and love everywhere. I know I sound like a hippy, but like everyone else, we're all sick of the shitty side of life. I hope you and your family are well. let's hope this subsides and sorts itself out very soon.
 @Beniamin Batuta  No one should be killing anybody.
 @Follower of The Old Ones  so what russians are doing in UA?
 @JOHN WALTER SALAS  ❤
 @St Matthew   sorry i don t understood what u wrote, to much slang
What about Palestine 🧐
 @Beniamin Batuta  Russians are killing Ukrainians and Ukrainians are killing Russians. None of it is good. Parents are going to lose their children on both sides.
 @Follower of The Old Ones  follower of Russian propaganda*
NATO should NUKE russia before its too late, this is just the start of world domination
 @Beniamin Batuta  You can’t blame Russians for this it’s Putin. My friend he’s the same age as me (23) and he’s in the Russian Ground Forces. He told me before all this happened that he doesn’t want to go and fight again. But look what happened Putin sent them off. You cannot blame Russians as a whole for what is happening because this started with 1 man.
 @Follower of The Old Ones  oh you smelly relativist.  Who is defending and who is attacking?  Russia has violated the territorial integrity of the AU.  During the Second World War, Germans and Jews also died.  Just who was really injured.  I am counting on your intellect.
 @Follower of The Old Ones  But a lot of russian population supports this 
 @Beniamin Batuta  It doesn’t matter who is attacking nor defending to see that this is bad. To answer your question both Germans and Jewish people were injured because of again 1 man. You just want to find a side to blame I see.
 @Brooke Whittle  that's exactly what I thought Even,  did anyone felt sorry for the bombing of Yugoslavia by nato
Your heart dont breaks for Afghanistan and other countries that NATO destroys?
How many of those western hypocritical comments we have to see? It's disgusting how those people have been educated to act. The western instigated coup of 2014 is the cause of all these ruckus, and UK is part of the coup, get a clue already.
Western propaganda...lie always
 @Follower of The Old Ones  not by one man.  Hitler won the democratic elections that means he had the support of the people.  The people who voted for him knew that Hitler, as a fascist, was seeking absolute power in the name of strong Germany.
 @lifeonmars 10  so your a flithy wasp
 @Tamara 24  go to school and learn history.
 @St Matthew   nice ad personam. Talk to me when you learn what it is a discussion.
 @Javanti Goodwin  just calling out hypocrisy kiddo
 @Brooke Whittle  no 😂 I'm a normal person, working in health care looking after cancer patients and keeping a roof over my head. fuck off with your judgement towards me. you don't know me or my morals. I want peace all over. if you prefer arguments over peace then you are the filthy wasp my friend, not me
May God protect the people of Ukraine. It hurts to see innocent people being killed. It feels very bad. When America killed innocent Afghan Syrians and Iraqis unjustly, it felt very bad. I want a peaceful world where innocent people will not be killed. I always condemn the killing of innocent people from Bangladesh
This war has nothing to do with Russian people.
Imagine Putin suddenly died of an aneurism or something. What would happen?
Best thing for Ukraine to do is take a page from Iraq, Vietnam, Afghanistan - and fight an insurgency against the Russians.  In the end such a waste.
Ukraine I will pray for u. NATO got ur back. And RIP to those casualties
It's only okay when US does it apparently?

The world's so naive to of thought Putin was going to stand down. I feel for the civilian's. Even more so for the civilian men to take up arm's and fight... But what threat does Ukraine pose to Russia... They don't. Russia won before it even started.. Prayer's to the life lost that wanted nothing to do with this.. Such a shame..
Iran IRCH|G are taking part in the Russian attack. Go Putin take the Ukraine back like Crema
Peace ☮️
How can the world just turn a blind eye...
Just imagine what’s going to happen once soldiers move in… it’s going to be a mess.
Can’t stand anyone attacking another country Russia , Ukraine, Britain , Iraq, Britain, Ireland  the aggressors are plain for all to see SHAME on Russia and Britain

Unfortunately the West laid the foundation for this catastrophy. Why encircle Russia with hostile hostile countries
Poland Slovakia Hungary Romania Moldova are Bordering Ukraine.By Putin's logic If Ukraine becomes part of Russia he will need to steal those countries as well.Then he will need to take Europe entirely.He might not feel safe enough with UK being across the channel so He will have to take that too.
I wish America and UK would adopt this. You see how people are scared to protest, BLM and their 5 billion worth of damages wouldn’t have happened if they were strict like Russia
May the blood of the innocent be upon NATO and USA!!!!
This is looking like the beginning of ww3 people always made jokes about Russia being a threat to the world well here we go.
ukraine been killing civilans for a week or so but everyone turn a blind eye
Ukraine needs to be smart: Just pack vehicles gridlocked at city streets intersection and leave the engines running, no gas so they will be difficult to move, take away the keys and so slow down the Russian advancement
The march of the tank kinda remind me of the op of AOT my war which have the terrifying vibe in it
With Russias forces down in Ukrainian. NATO has the opportunity to counter attack Moscow as its left defenseless.
chicken kiev
Met a couple from Ukraine in the Dominican Republic while on holiday in December. Can't stop thinking about them right now...
I will pray for your country and your childrens and families right after this video🙏🏾😞
🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🤍🤍🤍🤍
Why this is happening
Putin is a straight savage goddamn
The West needs to start using some of the Russian tactics against them. It is time for western intelligence services to start assasinating high ranking Russian nationals in the west. NATO needs to blockade Kaliningrad and threaten it with invasion. Japan, Australia and the US need to Blockade Russia's far east ports and Turkey needs to close the Bosphorus to Russian shipping. Any Russian travelling in the west should have their passport revoked and be placed in detainment indefinitely. It is time to get serious and actually put the screws to Putin and Russia.
kom on ukraine🤞🤞
I'm Scared For My Family There
I never thought this day would come when I’m still around and I thought Russia would not go to war so early this imminent war almost feels too hard to believe even with all the horrible things I already seen on the news they must be stopped but how
I am British, getting old now, nearly 60 with some health issues but i am enraged to the point of wanting to go over and fight for Ukraine..pretty sure there are millions that think similarly. He can't get away with this
So so sad
US, UK, EU, UN, NATO created this war..you always bully Russia....China, North Korea, Syria, Venezuela, Iran and muslim countries bullied by these evils should drop nuclear bomb to USA...
all the hypocrites on here... if this was the US doing this, there would be screams and howls from the cheap trolls on here... but if it is Russia, hardly a word against them.. and will these same trolls be happy is the US and Europe does nothing... ??? in the video 
I'm Georgian. you might know the country which was attached by Russia in 2008. the year of our lives was the most badly remembered. we were fiscally and governmentally destroyed. we have done everything that we could do without any military support. we have received only unnessecery announcements from every part of the world, but as a result of the war, we lost 20% of our country's territory. it was the most horrible time for us. the pain which lives so deeply in our souls keeps going with us. so as the experienced and harmed people we share Ukraine's condition with our whole hearts and stand for them forever until the war is over.  Georgia loves you Ukraine! 💙💛
hahahaha it finally started
America better not get evolved
Greetings from Poland. We pray for peace💛🇵🇱💛
Nobel Peace Committee are you seeing this?? This is what happens when you give Peace prize to a politician. Now Mr. Putin wants to show to the world who is the actual keeper of peace or on whose shoulders the peace lies safely in Europe. May be you should consider giving Mr. Putin a peace prize. Or a joint peace prize to Mr. Biden and Mr. Putin but that will surely bring Mr. Trump into picture and you should answer him as to why he should not be given the peace prize. So committee, in view of so many families being affected you should revise your policies...I wonder if a prize return from his rival politician will satisfy Mr. Putin's ego...
You did it to yourselves for wanting to join the EU.
Looking at how the west is reacting so far, recreation of the USSR is probably inevitable
 @HDsharp  why? Because it threatens Russia that they would want to join the EU or NATO. That those two organizations don't bully countries into joining, that the promises of joining are far more enticing than remaining part of an aging idea of a new soviet union. So Russia feels the need to strong arm and bully all the countries it used to control and deprive of freedom. What's your logic?
Не грузины ли начали эту воину? Ты глупышка
 @Barlos Bainz Jr.  Nato and US are in cahoots to expand their boarders by recruiting all former Russian states by coups to serve US imperialism. This is also happening in Africa, with many successful recent coups to install western pro leaders, this is war! A new wave of US/EU imperialism war. So please don't try to pull the wool over people's eyes. And not to mention the fake war against china! With the aggressive sanctions against China. Totally unjustified and provocative. Stop playing the victim when your the fire starter and the devil in disguise.
 @Barlos Bainz Jr.  Don't be fooled Putin long planned to reunite the USSR
 @HDsharp  there always is a divided and distinctive line between what common people want and what morons in power do.  Unfortunately, this has been a common theme from the beginning of time.  I nobody in their right mind wants to see others suffer.  Both sides are to blame here, or more specifically the morons who dictate them
Isn't a way to live side by side not necessarily with love but not engaging in hostile alliances that threaten the neighbour ?I think the formula of Finland would be a good one.We wouldn't be seeing this if rationality had prevailed
Puerto Rico 🇵🇷 prays 🙏 for Ukraine 🇺🇦
 @Beyond Travel  true to some extent but people do know what is really going on and they still go along with it, and support the side that rules them! So in essence they're just as guilty as their controllers are. However i see the oppression is coming more from the west, not supprised really with their corporate state 21st century mindset.
I agree with u. Every all other countries and UN only can print out announcements papers. That's all they are doing.
You fools don't learn. NATO, European union and Americans don't have your best interest. They gassing you up by promise of providing 
 @HDsharp  reported for promoting war crimes.
Why do you think your country did not get this kind of attention?
 @Beyond Travel  shouldn’t the Ukraine people have the choice to decide if they want to be a part of the EU? Are they not their own country? How does it give Russian a right to invade?
No matter what I'm stickin'with TOYOTA Cars 💯-Scotty Kilmer
 @Joscha Wexler  those Russians car they are absolutely junk.  My 20 year old celica can take them on
 @Rohnan  you certainly have no clue of what a war crime actually is. Go and do your research. Maybe check out the statue of the ICC and the Geneva Conventions.
@Gwenn: How is the situation in Georgia now ? I am sorry if I appear ignorant but there is not much being written bout Georgia. How has life changed ever since 2008 ? Thank you for sharing
sensitive soul don't click https://youtu.be/29kXhxNC0SU 😱😱😱💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
Well, as I remember it was georgia who declared war on russia, why blame them? Blame tge georgian president at that time, who is now hiding in the west. I love georgian people by the way, despite this issue, and i have traveled to georgia so many times, and i have georgian bank account and a phone number. But I support russia for its firm stand against the western hypocrasy, and would love to see georgia and ukraine understand the importance of geography and that the olny way to live in peace is to have good relations with their neighbor russia, not the us which is thousands of miles away
You claim to be Georgian, and claim it was russia who attacked georgia?? Maybe if Georgia hadn't invaded south ossetia it wouldn't have happened.
One thing is certain that if you are super power no other countries will have the guts to question your misdeeds. This has been proved in Afghanistan, iraq, syria & now in Ukraine. If Nato forces intervene situation is definitely going out of control.
Half these have never even heard of Ukraine but they're so quick to blame Russia for this situation
Who will help uk who who who
So Russia is just shooting missles at Ukraine apartments in 
Putin sure knows how to play the system.
Western propaganda stirring the hornets nest, check out the natural resources in the Ukraine
World top number 1 neucenar contry Rasisa 3rd world great war 100% win Rassia world win Rasisa
Self defense bullshit
Do Russian civilians support this?
Ukrainian president is just a west and nato puppet Go Putin
It is time for Ukraine to become a NATO country right now today so European Military and USA Army can send military Aid for Ukraine army fast as possible!
We need B52s armed with nukes.Those were the only things Soviets were scared of. 90 armed B52 circling around the border.
We believe in peace
Anyone still believes BBC bullS??
You should of listen to him, you idiots. Ukraine will never be part of NATO.
How few remember that in 2014 the democratically-elected Presidnet of Ukraine was overthrown by the Maidan terrorists, after a $5 Billion initiative by the USA. Who can forget Victoria Nuland, US Undersecetary of State, handing our muffns to the Maidan terrorists in the middle of Kiev?
Bet the Ukrainians regret not signing the Minsk Accords now. 😆
Putin sounds like Biden talking about Trump supporters. It's all propaganda, Putin is a cold blooded killer and the modern day Hitler.
Yes so russia nuke american warmongering azz
This is the very reason we as human beings we don't deserve this planet 😢 God help us
Ukraine supported Myanmar criminals junta now Ukraine get karma
It's super ironic that Putin is calling those in Ukraine Nazi's seeing as what he's doing is exactly what the nazi's did. He also ironically sounds like a western leftist who calls anything they don't like a nazi in order to gain favor.
If Nato s going to intervine then it's gonna get worse!!!
Russian army should stand for their brothers-ukrainians and be against Putin. He is already looser. Noone should be harmed because of one psychopath.
Why do us humans as a species not learn from the past for fuck sake we’ve had many wars in the past and still going on now and what has happened? Just bs with a bunch of useless innocent deaths …. I can’t be arse for this
🥺🥺🥺
And all this for what?
Why isn't usa and other countries not firing on Russia
War feels outdated.
Joe Biden has not only failed America, now he has failed the world.
Self defense bullshit someone needs to drop a nuke on russia
Dam they don’t ( F around ) Come on duh 🙄 Can we just stop wars .
Good thing you have a vest. That should stop a rocket 🚀
Who's going to come to the rescue ? Sanctions are not going to work and it's will take too long to effect Russia they need help now.
Here's an idea:MMA tournament between all the world rulers. Whoever comes out on top gets to rule the world.Ah, crap, Putin is a black belt in judo and Biden is 112 years old.
Hunter Biden better protect his art work and crack supply
Mike Chapman You are right. It's a travesty, that mankind is the dominant species.
Becuse pajeet russia has nukes
They're going to fight for their country but they were ok with kiev bombing their fellow citizens in 2014 and making their native language illegal.  That's genocide. Kiev really is neo nazi
This is  a war provoked by the west. Russia did what any western country would do to protect the security of their country. It's always the innocent people that suffer.
War is an awful thing and must be outlawed forever.. it’s jus legalized mass murder. Think about the innocent people.
This wouldn't have happened under the true President, Trump.Brandon cant even hold himself accountable...how is he going to hole Russia accountable? LOL He's the reason this is happening...The world needs to hold Biden accountable
Alot of properganda been used by all sides here.
Oil, oil, oil! All Wars are all about OIL. Oligarchs are the winners!  It will head West to Europe no stopping now. Prepare everyone around the world.
Peace not war, pray for Ukraine
Лживые СМИ. По этому мир такой хрупкий. США накачивала Украину оружием для войны, а Путин останавливает это все. США виновато во всех бедах.
STOP REPEATING PUTINS LIES UNLESS YOU PROCLAIM THEM AS SUCH.
This man Ukrainian president should go now because he was refused to negotiate with president Putin not only that President Macron also try to talk to Ukrainian president to comedown from his desire but he refused. Sad for Ukraine innocent peoples. NATO always said we are with you but now NATO leave alone Ukrainian to get killed by Russian booming.
Putin is a bully an dictator America 🇺🇸 and it’s allies why not send troop and support Ukraine I pray 🙏 for those their
Protests end in arrest, like UK, Canada, Austria, Germany all peaceful and arrests made.
all i see are cowards running away
Thanks to the US we have another war!! False flags, inciting , provoking, lying and getting all the countries to unite against Russia for no reason made this happen. Don’t forget Ukraine pushed by the US attacked Donetsk and Donbass. Russian is just defending its people.
This is sadly what you get for joining a union. Nato wont help in any way. People dont understand what Nato/EU etc is for. Its only for war.
this is horrible
We are Indian students
Why the fuck is everyone commenting fake news as a Russian my self I can say that no civilians are being harmed no city’s are being targeted it’s only Ukrainian army that is being targeted stop spreading false news
America warmongering killing iraq and afgan and libya????
There’re not a member of NATO or the E.U. Your comment makes no sense.
 @Saxman t  The whole point of this conflict is that USA wants Ukraine to join Nato but Russia do not want them to.
 @Mr Ex  . Nope, it’s because Putin is a dictator and can’t stand the thought of an independent country wanting to choose their own path. He wants the 1960’s back, whilst his oligarch friends keep their wealth.
 @Saxman t  Far from it. Russia and Usa wants the same thing, power, power and more power. This started when Ukrain first wanted to join Russia, but USa then pushed Ukraine to join Nato. No one should join any form of Nato/Eu or what have you. This is what happens in the long run.
Do you really believe that?
Just use tor and get real information
Its not false, my uncles family died few hours ago
Thank you Unites States
What  time  Ukraine  falls to Russia.
@1:09 why are you showing these buildings under the false pretense that they’re from current/new damage??! (Don’t believe evything your hearing & seeing people, Fact check!!!)
WHERE IS NATO ?! WHERE IS EEC ?!
Please my Russian comrades. Let the government know you don't approve this war! We want peace! Let your voice be heard! Love from your neighbor Finland.🇺🇦❤️🇫🇮🤝🏻🇷🇺
Bbc fake news clth ur mouth.the same thing doing in africa.
F Putin! He is no different than Hitler.
What don't you understand?rUkraine got bad politicians! They want to annex Ukraine to Europe and NATO to the army !!rNobody asks anything ... it's important that politicians fill their pockets with money !!rThe people have brainwashed the roses to smell more beautiful in Europe ..rUkranie politicians provoked war! Because the rule is known that Ukraine cannot be a NATO country !! By the way, World War 3 starts ... And what ?? should that happen ???rUkraine should now capitulate ... and civilians should be saved ... and politicians should be hanged because they provoked the war !!
All the people of the world pray for Ukraine but unfortunately prays will not save them neither God will do. Today is Ukraine tomorrow who knows..the only way we can save Ukraine and humanity is for the mere people of each country to take their fate in their hands and overthrow the dictators and stupid leaders of the world. Covid and now war , wake up people stop being the sheeps heading to the slaughterhouse.
Ukraine president is in bed with Burisma along with Biden
Putin will rot in hell for this. Enjoy your last days
Let Putin finds out that it's another Afghanistan for him
Ukraine President is WEAK and SLOW! UKRAINE YOUR DONE.
Apparently they’re trying to keep people from leaving. Putin is after the crooks that are there such as Hunter Biden
What is that African man discussing about War between Neighbours?Anglo-Saxons warmongers should get out fast
pray for ukraine 🇺🇦 from south africa🇿🇦…this is horrible and heartbreaking…🙏🏼putin is a bully
I could buy Russian military vehicles and drive them into Ukrainian land so could nato so could the west all thi is more bullshit to distract us from what our own countries have just put us through all the lies and propaganda with COVID-19 this is just world leaders distraction tactics
And america and Uk and france??
 @Arabian KING  I’m talking about Putin. He is todays Hitler.
When Donbass was bombed, everyone was silent! Now they are expressing sympathy! You are strange people! There is no need to test Russia's patience!
Everyone were afraid of Trump starting a war and voted Biden the pacifier. And Biden did nothing to stop this
Why can’t Ukraine be granted temporary NATO membership that allows NATO defend or deter Russia from what it’s doing now? This is appalling.
🤔Well like Russia said to years ago why USA aloud to go to countries go to war steal their oil , gas and much more & get away with it .. WITH A USA LAUGH AT THE END OF IT hhhhmm
Why can’t we just love each other or at the very least let each other be? The  intelligence we have and the capacity we have to achieve amazing things is perpetually destroyed by sick people making decisions ‘on behalf’ of normal people. This money grubbing, war mongering machine that we call a society has created this.
Sometimes I think the US and NATO is complicit with Russia in the inevitable fall of Ukraine.I might be wrong on this one, and I hope I'd be, but I think the annexation of Ukraine by Russia is preplanned - by both the US and NATO, and on the other side by Russia. NATO and the US not sending any troops to defend Ukraine (which is outgunned by Russia), and only threatening useless sanctions (which means nothing to Russia) or only sending helmets, platitude, prayers and eulogies to Ukraine. Ukraine needs manpower and firepower now, which the US and NATO will not provide - they're using Ukraine as a testing ground to check Russia's firepower might. The world is watching this game. If you got no nukes and your not in any modern political alliance which carries nukes in the modern world (though you'll have to be subservient and listen to those who have the nukes in your alliance), you're easily open to invasion. That's what happened to Iraq, Syria, Vietnam, Georgia, Japan (during WW2), Afghanistan (both US and the USSR), and now it'll be Ukraine. I'm not surprised why Iran and North Korea today are pursuing nukes, the bottom line: they don't want to end up like Japan in WW2 even though it was stronger than Germany in its acquisition, and today all those who possess nukes dictate the world. Ukraine's biggest mistake: giving up its nukes in 1994.
Stupid fellow.some part of the images are from previous wars.People are freely walking
Adolf Putin. I pray western countries unite and destroy Russian communists once it for all.
Lead by an chronic LIAR, with no interest in people. Russian or ukrainian doesn't matter, for him just matter if u believe his lies or not!
Prayers to the families
❤️🇺🇦
All because Russia  needs to stroke its ego
And no-one help Ukraine 😞
Ппц, все молятся за украину, а когда нацики и всу с самолётов растреливали лнр все молчали. А, ну да, это же ввс, и в 2008 они первые начали вещать, что рф напала на дрорджию. Это не война, по крайней мере надеюсь, что ей не станет, а спецоперация по демилитаризации и денацификации антироссии
Russia leader is worse than China leader
Where is France & US who made no fly zone to Libiya when heard about human rights violations.. why not make no fly zone to Ukraine and let western planes Gaurd Ukrainian airspace
pray for ukrain from Tanzania
Well done politicians / elite all around the planet you all should be ashamed from chopping down trees to sucking oil out of our planet 🌎 to kill people for greed and power it’s not just Russia it’s America Uk Europe China etc you handful of people are destroying Us  😡billions of us 🐜 ! Bless all my brothers and sister around the planet 🌎❤️ I pray for peace ☮️ and fairness and kindness 🌍 🇬🇧
Putin defending himself? from what? he is the attacker. If only NATO took Ukraine in and allow them to be part of the EU then this wouldn't had happened.
Because most people are not invested in learning military tactics and geopolitical occurrings. The issues a couple of years ago, were quite vague for many. But this.. this is a full scale invasion. There is no doubt regarding what is happening. Everyone can and will understand what this is.
Trump had a chance of at least slow the war with his army near ukraine
Nope
They way people are trying to some how prove that god isn’t real since he didn’t stop this war, lmao u lost atheist
Damn what did ukraine do?
I just didn't want this.
Putin was asking UK to stop shelling separated land for 8 years...no resolution only Nato loaded Ukrainie with weapons...this war could have ended 8 years ago....but noooo
We are with you in prayer, our young ones even ourselves don't deserve the WW3, if this is not resolved now, then will escalate
Did You'll Felt The Same For The People From Afghanistan And Iraq...!??????
To all of you who claim to love democracy, love Mandela, and respect human rights, remember this. NATO countries and the US were the ones who supported the racist, white, apartheid regime in South Africa. They vilified Black Americans as communists for daring to oppose US foreign policy terrorism against Africans. Think about that before believing anything you hear in the latest news cycles about 
Funny how the same characters who condemn Putin were totally silent when America invaded Iraq based on nothing but BS. Hypocrisy reigns supreme in the corridors of power.
Putin is the next Hitler.
This is madness... how could it happens these days? War is the most stupid thing that a human  could do... if war happened  like it was in medieval times( the King used to fight with the other soldiers in the front) And not sending poor young soldiers to the front with baseless reasons I think it wouldn't happen so easily nowadays.
DON'T BUY RUSSIAN.
My poor Ukrainian brothers and sisters  you are always welcome in your other homeland Poland...
Us and uk better stay outta of this one
A simple question. This standoff was for weeks. Why didn't Ukraine prepare themselves? What were they doing? Waiting for Nato and doing nothing?
Russia plzz stop it.. There are innocent people,,
Don’t worry that’s just their “Slavic brothers”. They are “one people”. Remember it’s the evil NATO that is responsible for this, not the country who is actually launching missiles. 🙄
In Poland we are scared we will be next ... I was crying with my Polish friends 😭😥 Is it the end of this world? 😣
Biden breaks promises and Russia does too. Whats the problem?
Don't worry about it! Tax payers got the bill! Russia will fix it. Never give up your Nukes this is what happens. Sad to say. A** holes everywhere. Don't trust humans. Liars that they are.
All BBC lies!
No western hypocrits colonizing pos dont care
Bless Ukraine
Would Ucrane use their nuclear weapons??They have over 1,000 thousand
I am supprised this propaganda works. People open your eye, Thinkof Lybia, Iraq, Syria, Yemen. the examples are endelss. Russia is not China. Russia acts, they don't play too much politics with their security.
BBC with its propaganda at its best :D
My heart goes out to the citizens 😞😞
Just remember Covid is still the most dangerous thing we have to deal with, wear a mask and get your jab that will keep everyone safe from this conflict.
This is so sad, so archaic and so not necessary. What a complete lunatic 👎👎👎👎👎
All for the selling of oil.
6:44 He says exactly what we're all thinking. A dictator's dream of a 
This is so horrible, Russia has more land than any other country in the world why does Russia have to be so selfish. Please let people have peace in their future.
Mark:13.7 When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come.
I am pro russian. And from the UK. Down with Boris and his Zionist government. Plus I know plenty of native white  naive brits who don't realise or don't  care they being driven to genocide thanks to mass migration. All I have to say is stop denying it and wake up!!!
Where is NATO sleeping again or hiding like world war 2?
Propaganda
War is no good, we all should pressure to stop all around the globe
I supported a lot of decisions from Russia in the past years but this is just not justifiable. Russia is attacking civilians. I hope NATO will take action.
This was building up for years and all because of arms deals with nato to make money so sad all Russia asked was take your weapons off our boarders to keep peace noone listen time ran out and now everyone  thinks this just happen in the past few weeks and days
Where was all this energy when palestinians, iraq, got bombarded to ruins? What a joke.
Never in my life did I think that I would live long enough to witness COVID-19 to War. I have lived.Restless hearts have no peace...
Ukraine should have stopped killing Russians in the Donbass Region.
Hey, Ukraine and its allies did not respect the truce. Now deal with it.
Russian soldiers are citizens. So are Ukrainian soldiers.
JustinThe fourth Reich.
WW2 was caused by the unfair treatment of the losing sides of WW1, loss of productive lands, and sanctions on the Japanese.
Also hyperinflation. 
 @Mutiny On The Bounty  Sanctions on the Japanese after they committed horrendous atrocities and invaded French Indochina
 @scout  The Chinese were already killing each other. The French were just as bad as the Japanese, but no sanctions on them.
 @Mutiny On The Bounty  reductionist history. Either way we don't sanction countries that have lost wars. It's still 100% appropriate to sanction hostile countries that are actively invading other countries however.
 @Justin  France will never be righteous
 @Mutiny On The Bounty  chinese were killing each other until the end of 1936 a couple months before the Japanese invasion
Just give up and life goes on 🤷🏾‍♂️
Prayers 🙏 to Ukrainers
Self-defence? Quite the opposite. Lies and inhumanity. The Putin virus is spreading. My heart goes out to Ukraine and the Russians who absolutely don’t support Putin’s insanity.
Why are they targeting civilian apartments
All the warnings from US and Allies. No troops to Ukraine. Ukraine would have never listen on one side. Taiwan learn your lesson US will never send their sons and daughters to fight for you.
This is so sad 😭 prayers to Ukraine.
Ukraine started this by attacking the Donbass Ukraine USA and all were warned.
Ukraine should be bombing Moscow
It seems like war has stop covid regulations there. No more mask 🤨
Russia's military breached the border in a number of places, in the north, south and east, including from Belarus, a long-time Russian ally. There are reports of fighting in some parts of eastern Ukraine.
So while the world focuses on Ukraine, China will quietly take Taiwan. Thank you Mr Putin…
But I thought this wasn’t a war...
where’s the UN  oh wait Hitler started the same way , the UN is spineless
Ukraine should b bombing Moscow.
I UNDERSTAND MORE AND MORE MADARA UCHIHA RIGHT NOW🤦‍♂️🥺
The rest of the world should join in this war now tha have crossed the line ✌️
Denazify ... Was Ukraine wiping out their minorities, in gas chambers, without anyone but Russia knowing?
🇦🇴
This is so surreal. Pray for Ukraine😢
Wuhan virus cause this war
New Hitler
Dear Ukraine people . Stay strong . Stay Together 🙏🙏 .. The world is with you ❤️❤️
The west is not going to shit. The powerfull are in this together.
We in the last days people,God's word talks about these things that will come,and can not be stopped,it's so sad,all we can do is pray to our God for His protection
This is classic western propaganda made by democratic 
Pzzy azz Putin BTCH
Putting another Stalin, who in turn was worse than Hitler.  None useful for mankind.  Warmongers!!!!!!
He’s gotta go
You know what is funny? NATO wants to integrate Ukraine in order to protect it from Russia, and Russia doesnt want NATO at its borders. Doesnt this entire story sound like a Ribbentrop-Molotov pact? I mean NATO already has borders with Russia, why to attack Ukraine? And Zelenski, why does he strike back if he wants to protect innocent civilians? Wouldnt this actually cause even more war? Wouldnt be a better idea for Zelenski to just say 
Heartbreaking ….. I hope the us take putin out like they did bin laden ….. nothing more than he deserves ….. people like him ,,,, hitler,,,,, Sadam,,,,,, Bin laden….. they are all the same….
its been an endless war and its time this get some surgery. this looks like some very skillfully set strike and those who don't believe that. just have no idea what it looks like when they send the surgeon out of the room
Guriller tactics where is cia and sas
Hey Russia come invade the US we dare you 🤣🤣🤣😭
The world needs to unite and squash Putin without delay. He’s already calculated expected sanctions into his plans so they will be ineffective. Drastic action must be taken immediately. Delays will only result in more unnecessary deaths at the hands of this murderer.
That's why having no leaders at all would be better world. Some dumass (cough Putin cough. The special ed kid)  can't just decide go to war..rThen again most humans are cancer of the world, being morons don't amazes me. Ape being Ape. Putin the ape go drink vodka and stfu.
how could this happen its sad seeing innocent people being murdered
Cowardly Russia
😭😭😭
Слава Украина 🇺🇦
Did you forget what you did in iraq??Hypocrites.
-00:42 
-USA nefarious acts now the result EU-Ukraine self created crisis -when Ultra right wing with CIA helped overthrow Ukraine elected government 2014.Our western governments and Media propaganda is endless. If u want know why -The Causes and Consequences of the Ukraine Crisis by USA  Professor in Political Science.Google utube  
No civilian would want others to suffer. It is always the political leaders, who cause chaos in the world. There was need for this especially when the world is just coming outta a historically dreadul pandemic.
So protests in Russia are now treated like protests in Canada.
My heart goes out to the innocent people who have suffered at the hands of NATO and America in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Palestine 🇵🇸 let’s be ethical and call our all war criminals and creators of chaos and give them all the same level of dignity and support.
We should have 3rd world war
God help Russia 😍
Putin lies just like the Democrats!👎
F**k you master of wars Mother f**kers
This isn't a war, this is a slaughter.
Chakde
We were better off with Donald Trump than weak joe biden
I hope the russian soldiers die a horrible death.
Having lost all contact with reality the formerly great corporation descends even further into the realms of deceit.
What i see is ,if NATO try to stop Russia, in this situation that is a direct WW3 nd of not stoped it will spread across Europe, but it's all bcoz of US who makes Russia to feel insecure in the region
This is what the west wants.  It's a sorry situation but I am even sorrier to say, it is necessary to demonstrate what must be done.
I have family that live I’m ivano frankivsk:((((
Three people protesting in a city of few million people. Russian love of liberty exemplified.
Is Finland the next one? Be strong Ukraina
Bloodimir Putin
And they all run away. Wtf.Taking over a country is fine but trying to hold on to it is impossible.Tactically  Putin is spot on as usual but he will have to offer NATO an olive and say  
War > Shot Dum Putin > ??? > Dead warmonger > Save thousand's of life's > Better world. <<<< Here i did you a solid one. Now tell someone in Russia to do that.
Living in history again
Putin you fool your stuffed now goodbye putin lol
The leaders should just have mma instead of letting their own citizens to die
Civ casualties that’s a war crime
I can't imagine how these people are feeling. My thoughts are genuinely with them and the world. Pray for peace
can’t they just like- leave the citizens out of this and clear this conflict like - let’s say in the middle of the ocean please 😀
Putin is a liar, just like Hitler.
We need to stop saying 
Give em hell boys 🇺🇸
Fight back Ukraine... God is in control
The Russian poeple doesn't want war with Ukraine, but they are afraid to stand out against the invasion since Putin is known for swift brutally if you're against him. It is true, this is not Russia's war but the Kremlin's war.
NATO needs to respond through Syria and Belarus. Wagners in Africa need to crush like rats. All kinds of embargo on Russia until Putin leaves. Because the false tsar wanted it.
If Hitler MK2 (Putin) thinks his forces are going to stroll into Ukraine and do what it wants then the Dictator is seriously deluded. Good to see the US made Javelin PTRK anti tank missile is inflicting serious damage on Russian T-72 tanks  in the East of Ukraine putting them and their occupants out of action permanently.
Ukraine fell in the TRAP.... great lesson to learn from this.... choose your enemies wisely but choose your friends more wisely 🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂
This is how Palestinians feel every day and have been for decades, America is funding and supporting Isreal while they do the same thing to Palestinians.
Can you imagine  the feelings of Donbass people  ?They have been shelled  for eight years
 @Ирина Лукьяненко  I fell sorry for people in Ukrainian but Palestinian when through a lot in the past 60 years
 @Mustafa Ahmed  Dont  worry  It wont last long in Ukraine Сiviloans  are not shelled , the military  infrostructer  only Russian  defence minister offered  to treat the  military men who  surrender with respect  But not the nazi  forces
 @Ирина Лукьяненко  You are the only nazi here you russian bot.
Why are they fighting? Trying to be daddys favorite?
@Martin Horváth  The problem is that all media is owned by the state in Russia. All opposition figures, journalists, etc. are quickly suppressed every time. The Russian media is the most propaganda news out there; trust me, I am from Kazakhstan, and we really are familiar how Russian government can blatanty lie
 @Ирина Лукьяненко  все все Не переживай, получишь ты свои 150 рублей за свою пропаганду
 @Ирина Лукьяненко  Today is Ukraine, then what?Kazakhstan? Poland? Baltics?Путин должен остановится. Он и именно он начал войну
these people lived in peace and tranquility for 8 years, when hostilities were taking place in the Donbass, where the Ukrainian army destroyed all infrastructure and killed civilians.the Russians bomb very carefully, only military airfields and only military infrastructure, they know that people will need all this for a peaceful life, free from the Ukrainian Nazis who are already fleeing to Europe.
 @Марина Марина  Kremlin bot🤡
@Марина Марина  You will also receive 100 rubles for good propaganda
 @Akiyoshi Saitō  idiot, i live in europepropaganda is everywhere, I read the Russian, English, German and French press. I look at historians, I roughly understand who is lying where. But the truth is that my friends' parents live in Lugansk and Gorlovka, and their parents tell the truth that you will never know.They know that they need to seal the windows with adhesive tape so that they don’t get knocked out by the shock wave, hide in the basement of the house, and not under the stairs, how to live without water, without electricity, gas.Can you live like this for 8 years, listen to the whistle of an approaching shell and quickly determine which side of the room to jump in so that the walls don’t fall on you?
 @Akiyoshi Saitō  BS! Dozd , Moscow's  echo critisize  tthe authorities and Putin  as well  But  they  are not banned like   the opposotion canals in Ukraine
 @Akiyoshi Saitō  Did Putin  start  maidan ?Did  he send    Ukrainian  army to shell Donbass ?
Thank you 🇺🇦🕊🇺🇸🦅
 @Akiyoshi Saitō  по себе судите?И много зарабатывает так?
 @Александра Нестерова  путин вторгся на чужую территорию, АллоКак можно его оправдывать?
 @Akiyoshi Saitō  оправдать?А алея Ангелов ,где могилы более 200 маленьких детей,погибших из-за  бомбёжек украинских военных?А Одесса,где сжигали людей заживо?И вместо того чем наказать виновных в этом зверства  правительство Украины выносит благодарность за убийство людей.Вам продолжить?Хотя по мне и этого хватит с головой.А где было ваше сочувствие гражданам украины ,когда происходили эти события?Тех кого убивали были же гражданами украины,почему вы не переживали  за их судьбы,за то ,что многие дети никогда не вырастут,за оставшихся детей сиротами?Почему переживая за одних  вам обсалютно плевать на других?
 @Akiyoshi Saitō  what are you talking about? I am from Russia and this not true.
There will be no peace, destruction is coming all over the world ⌛⌛🚀🚀🛸🛸🛸🛸🛸🛸🛸🛸🌎☄️☄️☄️☄️🌋🌋🌋🔥🔥🔥🔥
Pray doesn't work. If God care he would then even prevented which is even better.But let's just hope it stop faster than realistically expected.
 @Akiyoshi Saitō  Если она сказала правду, то сразу пропаганда? Правда глаза вам колит.
 @Tribe of Judah Hebrew Israelite   positivity shines through you...
 @Hero4fun  Yeah, agreed. Peace regardless.
 @Akiyoshi Saitō  Propaganda bot. Shame on you.
Lock me in a room with Putin we will see how tough he is
That's why I'm grateful to be in Africa... not so complicated
Mary!!!!
😡😡😡
Ukraine：where is my USA brother？USA：？？
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
6:50 sad but true
All out war by Putin😳🧐🙄😱😕💔
Russia has a bad track record for winning wars. They won WW2 with millions of casualties and the winter saved them.
Where are the Ukrainian troops? All running away! Fight cowards! Why aren’t citizens defending their country!
Biden, you are a weakling and you are not worthy of being the president of such a superpower as the United States! Disconnect Russia from SWIFT and from the Internet! Then you will see the effect!
No war ! Killer Putin..
We have technology but to sort out disagreements we resort to war. We have a long way to go before we call ourselves human beings.
Ukraine doesn't want this. Russian citizens don't want this. This war is the result of a corrupt, dying dictator with too much pride.
NATO ain’t gonna help nothing sanction sanctions sanctions Biden can’t spell it or even no what that word means
For months, the devil was communicating one thing while his actions said something else.  This is the result when a man believes he is a God.
не злите русских и всё будет у вас хорошо!!!
7:45 it's John Lenon
We shall punish Russia
Idk if anyone knew this... But zelenski was a comedian before this. Gotta wonder how the election ballots taste now
We can create weapons to destroy but can't create peace.What's the world coming to.
General Patton was right.
I knew he was going too do it .why because many say he don't have the balls too back up in a corner thinking he was afraid he comes out .never provoke one's doing that they wantNow we entering ww3.you can forget about covid right now the world has a bigger disaster .amd that's nucleur weapons.may we make it through.millions of lives will be lost worldwide and millions will make it.overall www3 is here .survival mode you should start right away and may God keep you all safe
Covid?
I would fight and die for those people
Direct result of the EUs ambitions to expand east, and threat of NATO on its borders. Show em Putin.
The united States should bomb Russia

Putin is a monster.
Fervent prayers go out for Ukraine n Russia too. Have mercy on us o Lord have mercy. In Jesus' name may peace reign.
Bad ass Putin
Are these guys crazy or something.
Oh my God this is horrible You people didn't say anything when the American attacked Afghanistan Iraq.. Russian was waiting for their moment for decades
Russia must be removed from the UN Security Council, especially as it occupies the Presidents chair.This is what Hitler did, “we aren’t going to invade”………..”Yes we are”.
THE FAMILIES, THE KIDS,    I  CANNOT EVEN carry on today
This is insanity 😥
Probably scenes from an old movie🤷‍♂️
Americans and Britons are doing the same in Africa sponsoring a lot of militants and you smile
😢🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
☹️☹️☹️🥺🥺🥺😭😭😭💔💔💔
I felt so bad for the parents trying to protect their children helplessly. #staysafeukraine #lotsofloveandprayersforukraine 🙏🇺🇦
Whatever… I am not seeing all these people blown up like the western media claims… just saying
What about the Ukrainian people of the Donbas who’ve been subjected to ruthless bombing by Nazi/Fascist coup gov since it was installed by US 8 years ago.  The huge increase in shelling of late targeted the so-called “Separatists” who are descendants of Russians - not Genocidal Nazi Poles.
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 God cover each and everyone ooooooh God peace and love God peace peace 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
No telling how many of those top secret documents Trumpty Dumpty gave Putin, he is as soulless and ungod fearing as diaper don
Translation are wrong. I will not protect Putin. I just want to say. Translation are wrong. Putin say absolutely different things.
God bless Ukraine.
I hate it when the one who's in the wrong acts like the victim. I'm looking at you Putin.
this is actually happening  damn
Get the taste of your own medicine devils
Putin is insane
USA NEEDS A WAR TO SELL ARMS !!!!!!!!!!
Good stuff!
so nato is silent.... nice work usa
Australia stands in solidarity with the brave people of Ukraine against this barbaric and wholly unjustified military action by Putin. As in the days of Nazi Germany well can we ask, how can a cultured, educated and intelligent nation such as Russia unleash such barbarism and unjustified militaristic expansionism on other nations who do not deserve this?
Putin calls them Nazi's and they call him a Nazi. Seems everyone's a Nazi now if they oppose you.
If any country needs help then you guys can always call me and I'll be there to help you with my homies, clear and out 😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎
Poor innocent people 🙁
People! I am from Russia and, believe me, neither I nor anyone else from my friends and relatives chose this war! this war is the result of disputes between the 
I can't someone could be evil enough to kill innocent child and helpless mothers and fathers. I can't even imagine being in Ukraine,my heart goes for the civilians. #staysafeukraine #lotsofloveandprayers 🙏
Hahah news has people shook so bad
Exactly the Western propaganda is sailing high once again.
Would Poland be next?
This is what happens when a country allow to be used by a country  miles away across the antlantic ocean at the expense of their security. The NATO can only hold a flurry of meetings in boardrooms and press conferences with threats of swift and severe sanctions while ukranians die. The west has no moral authority to condem russia, they have destroyed many countries like libya, iraq, afaghstan and they turn a blind eye to illegal occupation of israel in palestine, so they either shutup or if they have balls face putin militarily.
demon time
How this is allowed to go on crazy I hope the world stands behind Ukraine
Kiev not kyiv.
why in the fuck are we standing by and not striking Russian targets ,those boys and girls are cruse missiles ,tank rounds ,fighter jets . strike ........................
Hasn’t the virus killed enough people already
He is crazy he has turned like Stalin and Hitler The old man is right 6:49
After natural disasters, Corona one more thing left that is war. People already devastated one more blow to the civilians.
When will this end? Haven’t we fought each other long enough? We don’t need another war, we need peace! This is horrible!
06:44 beginning of a third world war 🤔 why? It didn't happen when vietnam, syria, iraq or afghanistan were invaded and Palestine is continuously being attacked and under occupation for a few decades now! So why would it happen this time?
Ukrain destroyed many countries and responsible for killing many people in Srilanka. Illegal arms export to corrupt governments  and war mongers. Feel sorry for the people though.
check my channel guys my friend of mine are captured some of my uploads
No body speaks about Palestine and the brutality of Israel but now when same happens to Ukraine all the world is speaking the world is blind UNO and Humans Right are the devil in angel disguise
It takes two to tango.  You could of became a neutral independent country instead of a NATO member if you didn't want war .
And the pets. Totally evil
Putin is able to do it, without a second of human emotion...he is evil, true evil.
Nobel Peace Committee are you seeing this?? This is what happens when you give Peace prize to a politician. Now Mr. Putin wants to show to the world who is the actual keeper of peace or on whose shoulders the peace lies safely in Europe. May be you should consider giving Mr. Putin a peace prize. Or a joint peace prize to Mr. Biden and Mr. Putin but that will surely bring Mr. Trump into picture and you should answer him as to why he should not be given the peace prize. So committee, in view of so many families being affected you should revise your policies...I wonder if a prize return from his rival politician will satisfy Mr. Putin's ego...
Don't know why we care it's not our problem
USA declined is only way to world peace
We need to fight.
Putin needs to be eliminated he’s another hitler.
And this is why every country needs an armed citizenry.
#Stopthewar
The innocent suffer. I can see WWIII coming as we speak.
Then Ukraine all needs to come to USA
Please take a moment to analyse the images, with kind of missile is able to remove all the windows from a building and why all flats look empty? They are clearly showing some abandoned building and a random domestic fire. Truths is that except for some strategic bombing Russian army is already near Kiev and the Ukrainian army have already decided to not fighting. No civilians have been killed or injured.
Lord Jesus please protect all the innocent people, animals and military.🙏🏼🤍 Protect all your people Lord Jesus. Praying for Ukrainien 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Looks like Russia wants Ukraine puppet
لماذا الحرب الا يستطيع العالم ان يعيش بالسلام ويبحث عن مايقربنا وليس التفرقة دعواتي لأوكرانيا والمدنيين في كل مكان🤍🙏🇸🇦
2022 is Puttins last year he’s gonna be alive.  Jim Jung Un and Xi Jin Ping is next.
I cant believe biden in his address today says that the sanctions he places will stop putin. what a idiot. if putin keeps goin after ukraine, there be huge hunting parties for democrat idiot people. somehow they believe in biden
Not even the Russian people want this.
Question to all you people is where were your hearts when USA attacked and invaded Iraq, Afghanistan, Syira, Lybia and also Israel been doing that with Palestine for decades and India doin same with kashmir where were your hearts ? You bunch of Hypocrites if they are allowed to do it even when they had no issues they still did and they are still doin it but Russia can't do it for itself to defend itself ? Im not even Russian but im with PUTIN good job
Snarling - sweet. Funny how members if the Royal family were such Hitler fans, and how after WW2 the US (& Canada) took in so many Nazis, including Ukrainian Banderas murderers.  Later the US conducted Coup vs. elected Chile gov & installed vicious Spanish Fascist General dictatorship. So no real surprise that in 2013-14 in Ukraine, it sponsored a vicious Fascist/Nazi powered coup.  The devastation of Nazi destruction to Russia was on such an industrial scale that it can’t be forgot.
Dont join NATO and it will be fine for Ukraine !-
Welcome to a new more dangerous triple cold war russia and china need to go.
Just wait people of Moscow and other cities, your rat faced dictator has enraged 40 million innocent civilians and they will be coming to your cities for revenge. Car, truck and backpack bombs are in your future
yep putin needs to be stopped some how somme way Spray for the Ukraine people put a golden light of Angels and gone around them and let’s pray for the innocent Russian people and let’s pray someone stops Putin amen
USA and their alies are responsible for War.
Horrifying. While some in Russia wave flags and celebrate over this. Sick world
Madness!
Thanks to germans who funded this army
sad. this is what happens when you mess with the bear. all that joining nato bullshit. how is that working for you??

All this over USA wanting to stop a pipe line madness. 😒 .First victim of war is the truth.
This is all Bidens fault,  he closed the pipeline,  its his fault all these innocent people will be killed or arrested in russia for not being for war.  Its wrong,  but its our biden fault.  Believe it.
Death to Russia, the Evil Empire
The war between Democracy and Decatatorship
Which Ukrainian civilian area/building/residential complex has been hit so far?🤔
blitzkrieg pincer movement on Kiev, from the north, south and east,
Putin is scammbag
Ukraine is part of Russia like POK and Aksai cheen is part of India. Indian support Russia 🇮🇳 🇷🇺 ❤..Cowered USA and their alies keep away, and lessons to those countries who support USA and their alies.
Putin lied 🤥 this is new politics lie and lie from UK TO INDIA 🇮🇳 TO ALL
When is the world going to realise putin is a relic of the old Soviet Union (a lieutenant colonel in the KGB) and still thinks it should still be so.He is no better than Stalin and the rest before. The world will do nothing, nobody wants a world war again and he knows it.
Britain wasn't acting this concerned when it bombed Serbian civilians in much more brutal manner eer in 1999.
It’s war, the only question is how big this war will get
Innocent civilians die because of some crazy russian dictator And you support him?
So what this Hitler is doing now justifying your logic.   Really!!!!!
Putin is pure ROT.  Evil selfishness permeates every cell of his putrid body.   The Us and the Western Alliance must reconsider their position on not using military force to counter Putin in Ukraine. This madman's rambling speech about his 

Evil Putin stop your crazy aggression, the world will punish you big for this one.
Ukraine thought they could sell out to America and that America will save them 😂😂😂😂
It sucks because im sure those in the Russian military don't want to do this.They are just pawns in this whole thing, but I hope they realize what they are doing is wrong.This is not serving your country, just a mad man's ideology your carrying out
For anyone to understand Putin, one must first understand Wagner.
Russians do not want war, so that people die, this is Putin's initiative, I write this as a resident of the Russian Federation, Ukrainians and Russian fraternal peoples, we are all Slavs, peace in Europe! 🇷🇺🇺🇦🇪🇺🕊
Remember no Russian
There aint no big war coming between them. They have a deal that cannot be told here on youtube since it gets taken down. Its like hollywood and they play with ppls lifes
Support Russia against Ukrainian aggression
The US finally losing the status of super power and is now reduced to felinity.
🤭ZALENSKY NO EGG🥚🥚🥚
Tell Joe to go arrest Putin like they did Sadaam and Kadafi. ✌🏽
Check Point Charlie in Berlin and all land east belongs to Russia. That includes the east block countries.
why do they have civilian targets?? i mean bomb residential buildings???
God bless the civilians of Ukraine...its the nato nations to be blamed for prvoking Russia and for fake promises to Ukraine..@8:11 Is attacking on iraq by U.S.A wanted by American public or Whitehouse.
Russia needs to be taken out. Why he’s doing this to innocent people. People the citizens you have problems with your US government then you need to take it up with the government don’t be barman innocent people killing them because you do not care you want to take their territory. This is 2022 can we put our guns and missiles down and talk with a mouse. Why do we have to go through wore once again. There’s now billions of people in this little town that u  killed just like the Nazis.
politics is a filthy game 🎭
😔😔😭😭
Damn, this is really a Historical moment for the books. A Terrible one! I can only wish for the civilian's safety.
What other options did they have?
Great to hear the people is against him!
Russia is too large
The UK is using Ukraine to start beef with Russia, just like they used Poland to split Czechoslovakia. UK troops arrive... Fighting starts. They won't show how they are hitting Russia. Will they?
I hate russian peuple I hate Putin For what russian people need war in Ukraine To keep Putin in president chair .Russian are poor people For what thei need a war ?  They are leaded by a crazy man
I pray all Christian's can come together as God's people not people of specific countries. God Bless everyone.
Americans : 
War is not the path one should follow. Humanity must prevail. Let’s pray for peace.
Russia 🇷🇺 👎🏻 what’s the world doing especially india
We need to do something about this. We can’t keep letting this tyrant break international laws. If you break a law there is consequences, and not this weak sanctions! We need to use the force of nato and the US. People forget how powerful we are
De enige die Poetin echt aan kunnen aanpakken zijn de Russen zelf. Van binnen uit hem tackelen !
Staying home is the worse idea
Is Covid over now? The west caused this…
please accept Jesus Christ now as Lord and Saviour if you haven't yet. Time is running out. He is coming. He is the Truth, He is the only Way back Home to heaven when all of this is over. Your soul is eternal and we have free will. God wants us to choose Him (He loves us but didn't want to make us robots, choosing anything that isn't God is DEATH, for GOD IS LIFE). all we have to do to be saved is to believe on Jesus, what He did for us..that He died for our sins(we were born in sin and made choices from this broken condition) and after Jesus died on the cross- He was risen after 3 days... when we believe on Him we are resurrected/reborn ETERNALLY with HIM! you must be reborn/saved to go to Heaven. So, please, beloved, BELIEVE! Ask Jesus to come into your heart and help you understand, ask Him to forgive your sins and be Lord over your Life! He is with you right now and always! Jesus is coming soon to take His believers out of this world so when millions of people disappear know that it was Jesus (not aliens or something) and whatever you do...do NOT deny Him as Lord and Saviour, DO believe in your heart, and DO NOT take ANY mark that will be introduced here (I would say ANY AT ALL, but especially if it is going to enable you to buy/sell/etc...DO NOT DO IT! AND DO ACCEPT JESUS!1 )I LOVE YOU, BELOVED. But more importantly JESUS, our KING/LORD/SAVIOUR, LOVES YOU!!! God bless you. God be with the tender-hearts and good souls around the world in this sad time. God use this time to bring people to your beloved Precious Son, Jesus. In Jesus' Name I pray. Praying for you all.
❤UKRAIN MUST PAY💰 4 MH17✈💥🇲🇾❤
The only way ,is for the Russian public to voice their opinions against the occupation of another Sovereign state. Has Putin  not understood about social media. So come on Russia, stand up to this bully!!??!
Bravo Putin!!!
Fiction exposed?  Y'all really thought this wouldn't happen?  Laughable.
https://youtu.be/deB00rQQHcU
❤UKRAIN MUST PAY💰 4 MH17✈💥🇲🇾❤
8 years since illegal overthrow government in  Kiev ! They was asked to negotiate Minsk  peace plan ! Ukrainian government failed to brought back piece to Ukrainian land!
Ukraine Ukraine!!!!what about Yemen,Palestine,Sirya and all the other countries victims of france and america aggression??
pray for ukraine !! 😢😢
It's easier to ask the civilian for stay calm while the president hidding in the bunker, cowards
Impeached Joe Biden
China and Russia are a threat to this entire planet
Russia is actually committing a war crime. Attacking unarmed civilians.
Ukraine is Poland..1939. Hitler annexed Sudetenland because it was German anyway, then he got enough assurance Britain was defused and he went ahead with his surgical strike of Warsaw and later everybody else… mark my words we have more indications of Putin’s roadmap to war with NATO then we had of Germany’’s warplans.  Putin does not intend to stop until he has re established the Russian Empire!  UN should declare war on Russia before it gets much worse.  Biden should put on notice any country that aids Russia will be accountable for war crimes.. immediate retaliation and war crimes trials later.
Generosity, tolerance and forgiveness and kindness are essential in establishing peace and building a welfare society. If there is disagreement, disagreement or disagreement with someone, it should be explained nicely by reasoning and data. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Good and evil are not equal, but resist evil with that which is good; As a result, the one between you and the one who has the greatest enmity will become your best friend '(Surah 41 Ha-Mim Sajdah, verse: 34).
If Ukraine wants a shot at diplomacy, they need to find a way to strike Russian civilian centers in St. Petersrberg or Moscow to force the Russian people to turn against Putins decision. He won't risk losing control in the homeland for Ukraine.
Thx God the us don't do drafts no mo
NATO bullies stoked the conflict but when missiles started flying they ran with their tails between their legs leaving innocent civilians in Ukraine to suffer Putin's wrath. Why don't the US troops who were being shown on TV heading to 'bolster NATO eastern flank' intervene? Cowards!
As Putin said in war declaration. Whoever tries to stop Putin or creates threat to Russians. Will lead to such consequences that you have never faced in your history. Putin can take China, Usa and all the little countries with one sweep. Sanctions take months to have any effect by then the war campaign has progressed a lot.
Thanks joe Biden smh 🤦‍♂️ ! If trump was in office this would of never happen ! World war 3 comming
The Bengals was supposed to reset the timeline great...
Russia is the biggest killer of  other Slavic people
All Russian assets abroad should be seized and Ambassadors expelled.
I love the Russian people but Putin is completely a loose cannon and should be trled for war crimes.
May this will end in peaceful manner❤️
There goes ww3 China is now going to plan to invade Taiwan may god be with everyone prayers for the families
From that deadly pandemic to this horror OMG ....its sad to be alive
Ptaki też sie bojom
Putin has gone mad.
Self-defence my ass!
UKRANE -WELCOME 2 RUSSIA!®
NATO en USA are behind all this,, they to blame Even more for stirring on the war
What about the Louis CK show tomorrow in kyiv ?
This potentially could be the start of world war 3.😞😔😔😔😔😔

This is so sad prayers for all 🙏🏼 those in Ukrain.
NATO is reason this is happening!!!
After this , the world leaders will shake hand with each other ,Sign on a paper 
Meanwhile innocent women and children dead during middle eastern conflicts...People: oh well, ANYWAYS
This is probably Bible prophecy. Satan will cast out Satan!!!! 🙏🏽
Notice Russia hasn't attacked Belarus, Kazakhstan, China, Mongolia, North Korea. What do they have in common that's different than Ukraine? Oh that's right! They didn't collude with the US to attack Russia's security and geopolitical interests. In fact, all of Russia's other neighbours are at peace with it, conclusively demonstrating that Russia is a reasonable country. Why can't Europe have mutually respectful, win-win economic relations with Russia like China has done? China and Europe needs Russian energy; Russia needs China and Europe's markets. The relationship should be the same! China and Russia were not always peaceful. Now they are closely cooperating and winning together. Why is China smart and Europe stupid?
What did you think was going to happen he probably wasn't going to do it at first but then everyone being casual about it and then now look this is all done just cuz he wants to secure his territory and have more land to set up more bases
Iraq 1991,Republic of Srpska 1995,Federal Serbia and Montenegro 1999 and again Iraq 2003,Libya 2011   People forget very easy those far more worse and illegal actions taken by western authorities.
I mean Russia covers 2 continents.. And he thinks Ukraine is a threat?
New Big Bang TheoryIn regards to Ukrainian and Russian , Discord.                                                        The United States and future Administrations should not guarantee or commit to the military intervention in Ukraine for the so-called defense of  Ukraine it would be wise also that NATO not make guarantees of  military intervention or defense nor induction into Nato,  from what I've garnered  some of conflict stems  originally from desires to stomp out Russian culture and language in the Ukraine, considering over one thousand years in a symbiotic relationship it would prove   nearly impossible for Ukraine to do such,  as the culture is so interwoven culturally and historically . much of eastern Ukraine is predominantly Russian or have an  affinity for Russia they find themselves in the position where they  wish to secede from the Ukraine . as was taken by a  referendum as understood currently, the United States and NATO we're more than happy to see and help militarily  in the break up of Yugoslavia and I understand  this ,as Serbia had descended into Anarchy same can't be said for the  Dumbass region.yet we don't  recognize that parts of the Ukraine wish to secede and we should. it's good for the goose but not good for the gander  shows  the hypocrisy of American policy in international affairs .A possible solution Ukraine allows the breakaway of the Dumbasss region as an independent republic ,this free republic can deem itself an independent nation as Bosnia and the independent nations that now make up the Balkans or it can vote to join the Russian federation or it can remain independent, treaty with Ukraine no military actions on part of Russia to both states.Narrative that the Crimea  was illegally annexed by Russia shows the shallowness of American historical Insight when the Crimea   has  been part of Russia since the time of Catherine  and Russia is taking back what belonged to it when the soviets gave Crimea  to Ukraine it was understood as with in the idea and context  that the communist regime would continue  to exist and since that regime is null and void Russia is reclaiming the soviet folly ,this part of Eurasia NATO and the US should not involve itself. in a military context all these promises of mutual  defense aid Harkens back to pre world war 1 posturing, we know how that turned out.And now the big bang.Europe has become increasingly dependent and Russian oil and gas Europe is not thrilled that Russia holds the trump card on oil and gas contracts for instance Germany is decommissioning three more nuclear reactors which will cause them to look east for more energy ,Nato  the EU and the  U.S. using Ukraine as a proxy  to start a war will give us an excuse to break up Russia some more ,or so some  think unbeknownst Russia I'm sure sees this ,thus thier position  no more nato expansion into an area that historically is not part of Europe ,Russia has been invaded to often from Europe to be put at ease,this bear does not hibernate and its not the Cuban missile crisis that was seven thousand miles away from their borders Nato and Ukraine is in their backyard and all of this begs the question why is the U.S.and Nato  even contemplating  what would seem aggressive posturing ,yes Russia moved some units to the border it's thier border nato is thousands of miles from it and we moved military assets  next to them before they moved thier units who looks like the aggressor and don't say Crimea  read prior paragraph the question that begs the answer why Nato and the U.S.. Ukraine needs  assurances United Nations security council and talk to Russia they are your brother have been for thousands of years it would be to costly for the family to go to war
Yea, how convenient right?...
Putin does not drink.
Ukraine isn't a threat to Russia - BUT THE USA MOST CERTAINLY IS. What did Ukraine's stupid leadership think was going to happen when they collude with the US to undermine the security and geopolitical interests of their superpower neighbour? Notice Southeast Asian countries have smartly stayed neutral in the US-China power struggle, knowing that what happened to Ukraine now is EXACTLY what will happen to them, if they were dumb enough to be a US pawn and play Washington's games against China, which will make them a legitimate target for reprisal by China. Eastern Europeans are stupid whereas Southeast Asians are smart!
I never thought I'd say this, but there are some people that should drop dead from Covid.
You have been in war for 200yrs fighting asians, Arab's and Africans showing the mighty of your mother land's now it's your time , this gonna be different for you west nations and Russia...,😆😅😋😛🤩😁😃😜😝🤣😂💣💣💣💣💣💥💥💥💥💥🙏
Pls stop saying I hope everyone is safe in Ukraine 🇺🇦.    Because no one is safe
Ukraine started the conflict...now it is paying..
I hate British people still have colonial mindset
This is exactly why you need to vote out anyone from the left. They do not believe in Freedom and they do not believe in free enterprise. Please don't give up your country easily fight for your freedom and Future Families
الله يكون في عون الشعب الاوكرانييا رب توقف بجانب الشعب الاوكراني يا رب تنصرهم على المعتدين الروساللهم احفظهم بحفظك
DISGUSTING!!!!! He needs to be stopped by the UNITED STATES, CANADA, AND CHINA!!!
Ukraine need surgery ... This surgical strike .
U.S.A stay in yall lane ...
This just shows how good the world has it to have the US as the world's most powerful nation instead of China or Russia. Imagine what the world would be like if China or Russia were the most powerful nation in the world instead of the US
Everyone hope 4 Ukraine, will be brought back to peace!
Why would anyone think he was kidding? UNBELIEVABLE!!
My heart goes to the people of Ukraine, know the world stands with you!Put-down Putin!
These Super Powers need to destroy themselves They are the big threaten for humanity
Pls do anything you can to neutralise russia
Why the live media blackout online?
Where are the Ukrainian soldiers
Well, firstly, I'm not sure if China wouldn't be with Russia in case of a full scale war. Secondly, even if they all banded together, would Putin really just stand down rather than decide that if he doesn't get to win, no one does, then promptly nuke everyone involved?
 @Skynet  Scary stuff!!!  But something needs to be done besides sanctions.
The world will be A MUCH BETTER PLACE with China as the most powerful nation than the US! You must have conveniently forgot about Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Yemen, and all the DOZENS of countries destroyed by the US, whereas China hasn't even been to war since 1979. Who is worse? Everything the US has touched has burned. They egged on Ukraine to join NATO, knowing this is a Russian red line, and knowing they'll never risk a nuclear war with Russia. Now that Ukraine is burning, the US stays away again. The US is the most REPUGNANT country in the whole world!
The air raid sirens sends shivers down my spine.
Putin is a mad dog ramegging thrue Ukrain and nebouring countries he using the same tactik used an Cuba he think he will be the next Fidel Castro! I pray for peace and for the life of the innocent people! His ivel actions can not be justyfied!
If NATO intervene ww3 is guaranteed. China might attack Taiwan too. Ww3 will be nuclear war for sure. We will be back to stone age for sure.
I hope Putin gets what he deserves.
Russian Para troopers are being dropped over kyiv right now. 18 planes
Putin belongs in hell
why the f is a woman reporting on war not her place
Pls God have mercy😭😭 forall those who trust God pls don't pass without listening to this touching sng😭😭 youtu.be/B9DUbvsK6jc
israel breaks international law. no one bats an eyelid. Russia does it. Major problem!jokers in power. I pray innocent Ukrainians are safe during this travesty.
In such a serious situation, the great prime minister of Pakistan Imran Khan found great time to visit Moscow and praise Putin. How about that?  The Irony is Ukraine and even US always supported Pakistan against India while Russia always stood by India whenever there was a conflict between India and Pakistan.I want to ask Americans, if India were in war with Pakistan or China, can India count on America? In the past America always sided with India's enemies be it Pakistan or China while Russia backed India in the wars. By the way this Ukraine situation has shown India, America and the European countries cannot be trusted.I have to say India is really in a very weird spot. India is friends with Russia, America & Ukraine while India is enemy of China & Pakistan. China is friends with Russia and Pakistan is trying to be friends with Russia. Really a tough spot to be in for Prime minister Modi. He has handled the situation with China quite well till now. His next moves will be critical. In the matter of Ukraine, Modi has remained neutral and also, he tried to convey Putin to handle the situation with diplomacy.
What the fuck! What is Putin talking about defending,  Russia is the first to attack! Leave Ukraine alone. War and greed is the worst of humanity.
Typical BBC Propaganda and Misinformation.
Why west ,why are u crying ?.it is as same as it is happening in Palestine,Iraq ,indian occupied Kashmir  and Syria. It is the west that is creating chaos and mayhem  in this world because of their flawed concept of orientalism  and  liberator.west must realize that they  can not impose their values on other states.great powers must realize that it is the balance of power that is a pre_ requisite for peace and if  they try to unravel and disturb balance of power,same things will happen in future.for instance it is pertinent  here to mention the invasion of Russian in Georgia in  2008  and in Crimea in 2014.west had tried to alter the status quo and   as a result destruction  became the   faith  for  ordinary natives  of respective counries  ,not for natives of America,France,UK and of  other countries.
USA ,NATO YGODLAVIA 1999.G.
Everyone Says my prayers. stop praying, we all can do something. lets stop these polititions to decide for us to live or not? They always start fight and then they run. who face the fight is us ( public)
Some mad man go to special hospital,  some other go to jails but nowadays they are president,  prime minister,  politician,  i don't understand how some human accept this kind of politics
BBC State propaganda TV
Another Hitler coming. Putin needs to be brought down quickly. He's lying about everything.
Same... that noise is terrifying
Another Hitler with close alliances with China and Iran this could go a bad way for the west if they want to intervene
The Brits and USA destroyed Syria, iraq and Libya and they're trying to play all humanitarian for Ukrain 😅😅
I support ukraine from greece. My prays for you friends . We are so sad and mad for putin
they said
just imagine someonelive in part of your houseand pretend that is his house, but your a good person you let him live and make borderon your House, but the longer he live more people to come and also livein the long run they will destroy, rub and wipe youSo do you think do you want this to happen while his alone?Ukraine is part of Russia in the first placeUkraine will be just be Nuclear Ground of NATO if Ukraine join NATOThen the Russian people will be angry😡 and the Real World War begin and the Ukraine will be worse because it will be military playground like AfghanistanSo what American get after they pull off on their troops in Afghanistan?So Putin have a good decision to Ukraine and Russian will be one country before this bad happenRead first history before comment hereIf NATO will step inExpect Nuclear Missile  War begin.....
Love letter to the President of Ukraine. Hello sir how are you?Do you still maintain your selfishness?Don't you feel sorry for the little children in your country?What if many of them lose their parents, friends, and places to play?Is this what you call SELF-ESTEEM?
He is a lying bullshitter you shouldn't be advertising the shite he spouts.  Time to sink his fleet off the coast of france and the uk and take ukraine back.
The west instigated this into existence. UK had more forces arrive on Wednesday, told they were going Friday. They are not aloud phones. It wouldn't surprise me if they hit Russia first. I dont believe a word the media say. The UK only fell out with Germany before WWII because they wouldn't invade Russia not because they invaded Poland.  Where will Boris go if the UK gets hit? A bunker. Where are we going? Exactly. The UK is using Ukraine just like they used Poland to split Czechoslovakia. You talk about Putins currency... But the UK will have no fuel. Who needs who?
This is probably our only chance, to stop Russia for ever. If we attack Russia and put something little to defend Ukraine, then we won't have to deal with bs anymore.
This happening now it was  in the bible its really happens now nation is nation war God please protect all the inocent people Lord help them keep them safe and alive...
guy at 5:24 and what he says must be really dumb. What do you mean another nazi occupation? Ukrainians always leaned toward that ideology not russians.
Becuase of their stupidity, Humans will be the the cause of the destruction of humanity.
I hate war!
Wow I really didn’t think this would happen. I don’t understand why they would put civilian lives in danger
🥺🥲😰
I'm trying to cry but my eyes have been dried out long ago. This is what USA did to Iraq. This is what Israel has been doing to Palestinians for decades.
Is the nazi accusation real or just an excuse to do what they're doing?

Way to go Brandon! Much celebration in Washington.
I live a few hundred meters from the airport in Ivano-Frankivsk🇺🇦, which was hit by a rocket. While the West awaits, our relatives and the military will die.
God bless Ukraine.Stay strong ❤️.Love from India 🇮🇳
The 3rd World War Unfolding infront of our eye's. Sending Prayers and Love to all the Ukraine and Beautiful Russian People who are againest this War. God SEND YOUR MESSAGE TO ALL NOW.
I like putin why didn't you do the full speech u demonised  a Saint... ukraine are evil
Viva Fredom,  around the world  ! Pace not war! Pray for pace.
Why why why  this is heartbreaking
My goodness, tears in my eyes my 😞, My Ukrainian brothers and sisters praying for you, praying for peace
Shameless what next all corrupted politician greedy
Oh my God, for the sake of Europe's peace, Ukraine must surrender to Russia.
Russia is defending Russian people who live in Eastern Ukraine from the puppet Ukrainian  government that the Biden regime installed during Obama's term. Fake news is selling you 
Western countries acting like chickens now 😅🤣
So were is Nato the EU and the US . Putin just called there bluff
🥺
Putin's word it seems means nothing.
Sanctions are not gonna be as bad as you think! We cannot afford a fail state with thousands of nukes and borders with Iran and North Korea!
I'm so frustrated that our weak leadership in DC has entertained this blatant threat from Russia.  Weak Weak Weak.
Please don't !! War always destroys everything💔😭
war is not the solution in todays generation...this is going backwards to years of mistaken war wage around the world.
just imagine someonelive in part of your houseand pretend that is his house, but your a good person you let him live and make borderon your House, but the longer he live more people to come and also livein the long run they will destroy, rub and wipe youSo do you think do you want this to happen while his alone?Ukraine is part of Russia in the first placeUkraine will be just be Nuclear Ground of NATO if Ukraine join NATOThen the Russian people will be angry😡 and the Real World War begin and the Ukraine will be worse because it will be military playground like AfghanistanSo what American get after they pull off on their troops in Afghanistan?So Putin have a good decision to Ukraine and Russian will be one country before this bad happenRead first history before comment hereIf NATO will step inExpect Nuclear Missile  War begin.
Some people just praise the evil, blaming the victims. But the good people just can't stand looking at Adolf Putin.
Because the UK media are pathetic. Did you know the UK only fell out with Germany  WWII because they wouldn't invade Russia... Not because they invaded Poland. The are using Ukraine as bait.
Vladimir putin, you are no god.  You will fall soon.
Prayers for Ukrainian. How painful to see people dying and fleeing.  Most of the Russians don’t support this war.
Putin should step down as the president of Russia
No one likes war...what putin is doing is evil.Think about the civilians,kids and women all...They loose their homes with this covid around..
The best outcome I can think of would be a ceasefire agreement dividing the country at the Dnieper river. Otherwise this could just drag on forever and kill thousands and thousands.
🇬🇷🇷🇺🇺🇦🇬🇷🇷🇺🇺🇦🙏🕊️🕊️🕊️
Good job NATO.You started another war.You destroyed Ukraine.
All this because of stubborn occident
So where is nato and American soldiers? Still hiding? Scared of Putin? Haha now we know you Re capable of hiding and doing sanctions...
Love from kashmir we are with You Ukraine🇺🇦 God is with you
The people suffer everytime so people should choose a good governance .choosing a suck government created problem for the whole world
Why did Ukraine not agree to the implementation of the Minsk agreements?
Putin is a new Hitler, and the west is imposing laughable sanctions. Sad times.
It’s not KEEV is ke-yev
Complete invasion right through the morning
Where is the very charismatic war 'journalist' Christiane Amanpour ?
This is sad /: People with no type of military training are really willing to get killed for their county
Don't Forget US and UK still on top 1 at killing Civilians.
look like WW3 about to start 😥😥😰
Was a horrible way to wake up in the morning and seeing the news 😔 Strength for everyone affected by the war

how did you feel when you found out that Yugoslavia, Iraq, Libya were being bombed?what did you think about those who bombed everyone there, with carpet bombing. read modern history so as not to panic.
Common bully Putin, give some nuke to that Ukraine, if you think you're powerful.
 @Марина Марина  Russia will save and liberate Ukraine very soon. Slava Russia!!!!
 @Ser Kingslayer George Zeral  fuck russia and fuck putin
 @Nordav Devito  why? Ukraine is simply going to be demilitalized, look how carefully they are bombing, preserving the infrastructure for the subsequent life of the country. This is not NATO, with its carpet bombing of Yugoslavia with the people standing on the bridge

 @MyVictory  Then why they don't want Ukraine to be part of NATO Russia want to annex Ukraine
 @Марина Марина  That’s what the US did in Iraq Afghanistan and Yemen, just wait until an insurgency strikes to make a mess out of Eastern Europe again.  Not to mention the Russia had a track record of bombing an entire civilian city to smithereens so so touché.
Biden! Listen !! Open up the Key-Stone pipeline….you had closed it and killed the livelihood of the Ute Indians!!!  Literally putting these indigenous American people out in the sub-zero temperatures!! I know and your Andrew Jackson bigot party take pride in killing and displacing Indians ( your so-called Democratic Party-really Anti-Democratic—is responsible for sending Indians in the SouthEast to the trail of tears and Torture!!! Up yours Biden!!!
Zelenskyy is a Evil Dictator who kills all political opponents and has been shelling its own people since 2014... This skirmish is to get rid of the Ukraine Tyrant.   As usual biased BBC talking like ignorant children ...
Putin is so evil look what he did to Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria 😂😂😂
Subxanallah wlhi the end is near
Go Putin 🇷🇺💪🏻 Russian people know Brit regime and fake news Brit propaganda are the enemy of all Russians. Get the corrupt western installed Kiev regime outta there!
Alright Putin. You just say hi to your own fate
Shameless greedy politician all over the world killing innocent people to satisfy their own personal needs
Fight for few government officials that will be replaced is not worth war with Rusia
NATO destroy russia army .. fuck Putin 🇺🇦
Come, LORD JESUS COMES! Come Quickly Lord, Come Quickly Lord!!🙏
Hegemony of the west is over.
Lying Bully.  A country so determined to win sporting events they drug a 15 year olds and now they will be excluded from everything.  I don't understand the logic.
He blatantly said he wouldn't invade. Then ha said yesterday that he wouldn't target civilians. Always the lying S.O.B. The White House mindset of only sanctions implemented is foolish.
Please. The world's just getting out of covid. We don't want another war to ruin or take lives. Make peace.
This is not good to see civilian in trouble very sad
Can't wait to hear the song that Sabaton writes about this
Praying 🙏 for Ukrainian people.
putin dictator
Nuclear war is inevitable now.
Where is NATO? pissing in their pants shaking uncontrollably. Where is Joe Lieden? Sleeping on his sanctions. Ukraine needs to SURRENDER.
This may very well be the start of world war 3
Horrible, this is a horrible situation.
This is child's play what they did in Syria
Government is organized crime
Someone needs to drop every nuke on earth on Russia, ASAP (well, keep a few for China)
Nuc em back to dark ages

Ukrain government should surrender to save civilian life’s…  he dosent want to destroy it ….just govern it…
God bless Ukraine
Fake news
Wow this amzing
All because of a pipeline and sea ports to the south. My prayers for you the people of Ukraine.
Germany is defending itself against Czechoslovakia, occupying half of the country, installing a puppet government in the other half. Next year it will defend itself against Poland.
The war could severely damage the people of both countries.Therefore, I urge both countries to stop fighting for the sake of the people
Yooo
Without government, there would be no war and people would be free
Boris may take an anti-Russian stance, for that's politics, but the news outlets, such as the BBC, to take sides? That's not the function of journalism.
What a bunch of morons, Vladimir Putin should settle his beef in the ring with the other guy. Instead tens of thousands of people will die, all for nothing in 50 years it will mean nothing.
Putin must pay. Putin must suffer. Putin will perish.
please gather every one pray to god stop this war. Please don't get benefits in this war. Please help me to save this people...Please help me ..Come and join with me
Putin is a bloody criminal. He must be taken down
Why is NATO waiting? It’s time to strike back at Russia! Russia has been the west’s enemy for decades! Since Lenin and Stalin.
90% of the comments 
Show time fire bal fire ball 😂😂😂
Heartless Putin,will pay the price
Ukraine React ‼️ Go Ahead‼️
This time russia is gone too far.
with all due respect i hope putin eats shit.
Tell Putin that.
This invasion has no logical basis. There are no winners in any war, there are only unimaginable losses, pain and destruction ... only through the fault of cruel and dehumanized leaders eager for power, fanatical and without discernment!  I don't understand how people can kill other people for the interests of cruel leaders. Leaders who live in luxury and opulence, and poor people fight and die for them, and in turn become murderers by killing civilians, innocent people.
Leaders of Russia and Ukraine! PLEASE spare the civilians! They r not part of ur war! Take d battle to an open ground and take on each other BUT please spare the lives of children, women men, innocent public and elderly  people!
No country can now rely upon others for security.
And we have an American President that is dumb as dirt.
It’s only horrible because it’s not happening to the Middle East…
Repent Jesus Christ is coming back soon we in the last days Jesus loves you✝️❤️🙏🏽
Slava Ukrajini🇺🇦💙💛🇭🇷
Will Ukranian refugees be flooding the rest of Europe now? Strengthen the borders and semd then back.
What is The US and UK doing? Just sitting with their dicks in their hand? Yuuuupppp
The US is responsible for all this!!
Narsestic and evil
Love is lovely but war is ugly
Ukraine never had a proper army to begin with, although you have to give the Russians credit, if they go in full force and present a clear threat to the entire civilian populace then its one damm good way to bring a swift bitter sweet end to the war, (from the perspective of achieving their objectives of course, not saying I support them)
Can the BBC try to be neutral and portray all points of view, and stop being staffed by journoactivists? I know for sure that the Russians are behind Putin, rightly or wrongly, and then to hear that BBC journoactivist in Moscow saying that this is not a war of the Russians but of Puten is too much really.
I pray this does not escalate to world war three. May heart goes out to Ukraine and the civilians 🙏
Putin is just doing what the U.S and its allies have been playing.!
where iss the neto
hmm i think its time for russians to make a coup
This will be russia's second afghanistan.
The last thing the world needed after COVID 19 was war. We pray for peace
False flag
Stay strong Ukraine. Turn to God. Keep in prayer. It maybe a war between Gog & Magog so stay strong. The rest of your allies will be there but so will Russian Allies. From Canada.
When are the people in power going to learn? Nobody in the world wants any more wars,its like the world is being run by schoolboys in the playground and its only the civilised people who suffer!
The moscow power of Russians is op i am upset
UKRAINE  WENT TO WAR WITH RUSSIA  WHEN UKRAINE SET UP MISSLES FOR NATO AND US
Where are the weapon of mass destruction in Iraq, no falsely claimed by UK EU and US, they must must be punish by Russia
Bull shit news. ... Never shows truth. ... You always do propoganda against those whome you don't like. .. This is not reporting. ... This is BULSHITING
When NATO attacked Yugoslavia then, even Electricity was devasted. People were much much more suffer than this.
Go Putin, Go Russia. From an American military veteran, West Pointer. America has no business there or even in Europe or NATO. Let the Europeans handle European affairs. American tax payer money should be spent on internal American issues; America First. The Europeans are big boys; they can defend themselves and they can build their own militaries. It is time for America to allow Germany to be an independent country; and not an American Colony. I was a US Army Officer stationed in Germany; Germany is an American Colony; and it time America to allow Germany to grow strong and become an independent sovereign Country. Let the Europeans handle this; we Americans have our own problems. The Ukrainians had a choice; they could have declared and promised to NEVER join NATO; however they did not; which is fine; that is their right and freedom. However freedom is not free; so now they are going to have fight to earn it.
Putin is too funny, how can he see Ukraine as a threat. Thats like US invading Mexico because wee feel they are a threat. How rediculous. I hope people realize and see the true Nation of Russian Governemnet.. and wait China will be next they have been pushing the envelope some time back but we dont talk about it cause we need to much from them… World is in a sad state of affairs. And then you have politicians worrying about the COVID and Mandates give me a break…..
ww3? no. its not like nato is gonna risk a nuclear war with russia. Im sorry ukraine , just spread your legs and let it happen
Putin is a madman! He’s no better than Hitler was!
Pleading to the world. Tf . Fight your own war
Lives will be lost as things will escalate even more, my prayers go to all the civilians. However what Putin is doing I do stay right behind him there have been so many country accepting to go with NATO which in the long term it will gives us an disadvantage as American troups will have quick access to Europe and I do not want that type of power wars come with consequences, but this one if it is for that reason should happened or at least this is what I think.
Where are their allies?
In the west of ukraine how tho it should be east

Peace
„This is absolutely against humanity“. You’re right. But were the 40 years of war in Afghanistan 🇦🇫 not against humanity? Or don’t you even saw them as humans? Still, we stand with Ukrainian people 🇺🇦 Let us spread love ❤️ instead of hate

None was complaining when Nato did far worse and more illegal attack on Serbia in 1999, Serbia was taking milotary actions on their land but NATO attacked.Now they are crying for Russia doing same.

Putin SELFISH!
Russian military committing crimes against humanity
The US failed again to stop Russia, that's a real shame!!
JESUS CHRIST IS COMING SOON!!!!
So basically, yes, I feel sorry for Ukraine.BUT I don't feel one bit sorry for the WEST. From USA all the way to Australia.THEY ARE THE BIGGEST BULLIES and a disease to this world.They used and dumped Latinas.They used and dumped Africa,They used and dumped the Middle East,They used and dumped every island,JUST TO MAKE THEMSELVES RICH.They used and dumped East Asia but China later refused to be bullied.They are the ones manufacturing all the weapons of mass destructions, killing and torturing machines, doing all the BADS behind closed doors yet will use their media (news, movies, games, music, magazines, history, etc) to paint themselves good but all other people bad.They are the reason why the world is the way it is.They are the most unspeakable liars EVER!
Believe that Jesus ( Yeshua ) died for our sins flit forgive us to lead to eternal life in heaven! Those who don’t believe there is a lake of fire waiting for you 😭🥲😥 prayers to Ukrainians ❤️❤️🥺🥺🥺
I feel bad for the civilians but the corrupt government there is partly responsible. Russia is using a page out of the USA playbook and bringing 
Nato will not help you you are not their ally. Don’t believe the west.
Savage!
Hate putin sinner😡😡😡🇳🇵
What 14000 deaths in the last 8 us?
Cant believe this is happening. A country is being  invaded  and i could only watch as others sanctions? 😢
May God restore peace
This is against humanity and democracy! Putin says they defend themselves but against whom, against what danger? I don't understand what danger he is talking about? I still can't believe this is happening. So many lives are being ruined just because of one person's greed!
4:41 - “where are nato?”Mate nato was never around to help yous from the beginning. They could of simply by signing a paper but they didn’t want to
Soon the Nazis in Ukraine will come to an end and Zelensky will bite his tie like Saakashvili in 2008))
Different transactions ,Russian news ,European and BBC news
USA government told the world they realized a 
Insane! Nothing comes from war. Really nothing. Only pain, misery,  destruction and death.God have mercy on those losing lives.
surreal
I feel like im watching a damn eas simulation
Stay strong our brave brothers🇺🇦❤️🇹🇷
Hot take. this is why right after ww2 the west should've moved on from the nazis and immediately started dealing with Russia.
:(
ВAll because of the neo-fascist regime of Kiev, not only Ukraine itself suffers, but also the innocent Russian people.
How is it self defense if russia is invading putting an idiot
God-bless Russia the United States and our incompetent incoherent senile president needs to shut his mouth it's just another distraction from his failures of our country and is failures of covid and his failures as a man Russia is our ally
In 2012 a tarot reader warned of the date 
Where is Nato !
There was the opportunity to solve in a pacific way…Why nato and Russia did not use the brain? Money….only moneyMoney valued more than a human life, that’s the sad truth.For me in Italy all the people that want run away from this are welcomed
Mr.Putin must take revenge against the US and NATO to break down the Soviet Union. Putin wants the US to involve Ukraine in war to attack the US. Russia has already deployed S400 to gather information about the F35 fighter jet, which was one of the tricks of Mr.Putin.
this makes me so sad its not even funny
Finally Putin is no longer taking anyone's garbage god bless Russia
We stand with you Ukrainians, we pray to God to soften the heart of Putin....this so sad! War in the 21st Century .....No, no!!! God protect your people.
My heart goes to Ukraine, palastine and Iraq😔
Thoughts and prayers to Ukraine from Canada, down with Putin!
On another note they shouldn’t have let their nuclear arsenal go this is the reason Pakistan got nukes
This is the war between USA and Russia, Innocent people from Ukraine should not suffer because of these two country's big ego.Pray for Ukraine 🙏
My face book before baned had mostly Ukrainians / Moldova speckle of Russian viewers.  They are interested in a Ruler who purges corruption / gets justice & Equality.  This comes about by Truth / Dialgoue including consequences.  All politicaal rulers are corrupt / suppress / subjigate.  The so called rulers of the west are all sheep  following each others wool - therefore being ignorant  / contempt of Russias view point.  Fighting would only prolong blood and run the countries coffers dry - why ? for the west to move in after.  Ukraine leader was misled by the west & the people would be better to delete him on grounds he did Not get them justice.  Better for military to stand down & get on with life.  Learn from Ukrainian fighters recent years back  
My heart bleeds 😓 history repeats itself once again 😓
It is not Russia  that scars me but China.  China will now be on the march to spread it's communism  along side their allies Russia and Iran  because  of incompetent  socialist governments like Biden who blame everything  on Trump and nationalists. And now you scream and want nationalists to die in war defending borders.
Another American victory. Thank you, American people. You voted to make Joe Biden President of the United States🇺🇸।। 😑😑😑
launches missile 
Well done Russia Putin must punish Ukraine leadership
Russia did not start the war, it bombed the armed forces of Ukraine with pinpoint strikes after Ukraine had bombed the territories of the Russian Federation. Civilians do not move and all Ukrainian soldiers go home to their families. Because everyone is well aware that the war is based on provocations, that Russia is the aggressor. Russia calls on everyone not to fight and cleanses the country of the nationalists who bombed it and humiliated the people of Ukraine, and the army that watches the media and thinks that Russia is attacking ... but everyone who saw the troops in the city understands that they are liberators. For 8 years, Ukraine was subjected to violence because of the regime, and finally someone dared not to follow the lead of the West and turn them off.rAnger breeds anger, provocation also anger. peace to all, no war.
This is disgusting how can this still go on, this doesn’t seem right to me it’s been orchestrated probably by the US for profit
The civilian people of Russia are against the war with Ukraine. It is the Kremlin, which is a dictatorship, which leads the war. Putin is a murderer.
Pieces are moving
well Ukraine and Russia 🇷🇺 family all tho Ukraine start licking US and European ass they think they are going to get a support . snitches allways pay the price  . They forget RUSSIA is better for them by any means . i think Ukraine leaders are very stupid . now they begging for help . they should negotiate with wiz Russia at 1st they think they get help From Neto oho very poor leadership. Us sale them out like we don't know you now  . well done Russia they need to know . shame one Ukraine government. i feel bad for Innocent Pepole cause of there government mistakes they pay the price.

Give it a day or couple hours and the rest of the world will have to react. The public didn't want this the 1% did. War easy way of killing a lot of people and then bringing new laws into place.
FUCK RUSSIA.
All the west had to do was promise to not have Ukraine as apart of nato which is a fair call considering Russia and Ukraine history. Good job guys 👍🏼
Beginning of third world war
In 2022, in Europe is not acceptable
Russia thinks NATO countries are weak, but we're more ready than ever
Nato is doing nothing . More lies from Biden
GOD  bless  Russia  we stand  with  Russia  from  Somalia  we will  support you  love
Every super military power always find an.excuse to invade other countries. Thats sad for the civilians any where im the world.
Funny in north America our protests end the same way, unless you are antifa.

Putin’s blatant lies are so obvious. He must think everyone else in the world is an idiot. He’s just making up reasons for the war which is all about coveting for Ukraine and Black Sea access. I pray for the protection of the citizens of Ukraine.
And everyone is still licking the arse of China! Every Western leader is a fraud cuck to the Marxists, a crowd of Chamberlain's doing nothing but empty threats. China will hit Taiwan within the month
lol The West did warn u but they were 
Humans have been warring for power and selfish reasons since the dawn of time. Some people never really learn from history.Tsk.
Due to Putin's actions common Russian citizens will now be despised and discriminated against everywhere in the world. Even the common people of Russia have said this.
Where is the rest of the world? Why aren't we/they moving in from the West? Is this going to be another 1939, when we talked a mean talk while Germany and Russia crushed Poland. Hey WEST don't start that BS talking were you say 
My heart ❤️ goes out to sharm el sheikh along with my body as soon as covid restrictions lift. Then my heart goes out to the watermelon 🍉 stand on the beach
Leaders fight like children and it’s always the common, innocent civilian who pays the price
This is nonsense. Totally nonsense.  What else does Putin can gain from this rubbish?
😤😤😤😤🙅🏽🙅🏽🙅🏽🙅🏽🙏🏾🙅🏽🙅🏽🙅🏽😤😤😤😤
3:03 where?
Hey BBC.  Maybe do not show the faces of civilians who say that they will fight?
nuke russia plssss i pay
This is the beginning of 3rd world war
Ukraine should dump this western puppet president and speak to Russia…Iam sure Russia willListen …..If not just get fucked …Sorry for common people though
Stop russia ,but it might mean ww3, damn the mayas only made a little mistake not 2012 when the world ends its maybe 2024:S? hopefuly not.
The civilians need to be armed ASAP with RPG’s and heavy machine guns why isn’t this happening
What's been exposed is,the UK's *lies*.Russia is obviously ending the war that has allready claimed ovef 14000lives.If those were jews the Queen and her court Jews would be shrilling and shrieking.So kust get off it BBC because after all the UK has done the UK and it's BBC walk a very thin line.What spares you is the Commonwealth Principles.Heed them.
2 people representing the whole Russia...hahahha
As an American, I remember when the vast majority of Europe told us not to meddle in other countries and denied us support in the middle east. They can go fuck themselves. We don't care. Good luck Ukraine, but you're on your own. UK we still got your back if it gets that far.
Putin is a modern Hitler and needs to be stopped
Nato should have acted. They should have protected Ukraine. They forced Ukraine to give up Nukes and NATO is betraying Ukraine by not protecting its sovereignty. This is pathetic for the people of Ukraine. This is catastrophic
May Allah save and help the poor People in Ukraine
Fuck off russia and usa
I'm glad finally Russia attacked Ukraine, at least they exhausted all the negotiation channels but the west decided to be arrogant to look strong, now it's time for action and everybody is crying loud like babies calling for mommy mommy
SHAME ON PUTIN!
This is so sad for ukraine
THIRD WORLD WAR HAS BEGUN, ITS NOT IN FULL SCALE YET.
גוג ומגוג
Russia, You are killing people, not winning. You should be ashamed!!My heart goes to all of Ukraine.
Love for Ukraine

WHY? AND OVER WHAT?
Another peaceful protest.  Very nice!
Unfortunately wherever US steps in there is anarchy in that country. Ukraine should trust Russia than US.
Propaganda factory is begun
Man If a country was to invade America they would be met with suck a force they turn and run will after they done overran California and all the other communist states
War is not the answer only love can conquer

BBC propaganda
Show the Russians no mercy
My heart goes out to Ukrainians. All the innocent lives that will be lost for no reason is terribly disturbing. It really isn’t right
Journalist in an active war country where a bomb can come hit him at anytime
Since the emergence of humans on earth they never stop killing each other. They constantly engage in dividing themselves and treat each other as enemies. In all ages, from the stone age to the present time, I can't understand why humans need to kill each other. Humans are the most violent creatures that inhabit the earth, yet they are expecting and praying to God to grace them eternal life..
We all know you lot are a zionist mouth piece
Well done America and uk for bullying Putin into doing this
War of the fraternal Slavic peoples, guess who is to blame?
Cowardly attack on innocent people… but Ukrainian pm is a disaster
Dear God, high up in the sky!This is an SOS, from all of us, Humans. Please come quick and clean this planet. We’re in big trouble.
This is why civilians should not be de-armed by their governments and have their ability to protect themselves and their families stolen away from them by their own governments. God bless the people of Ukraine and us here in the US who are fighting to keep our second amendment rights so we can protect ourselves
What Ukraine needs now is support from its allies to take action against Russia. I am appaled that Putin thinks it's okay to launch an attack on an independent, sovereign nation.
Same kind of fire balls had been seen when Americans and British were attacking on Iraq, Lybia and Syria in the past. This kind of aggression had been set up as an example to others by them in the past. And BBC this time reporting each and every bit of it while in the past this channel used to ignore such attacks and showed least information to their countrymen. I wish Westrn journalists could work unbiasedly at that time too.
I’ve been to Kyiv and freedom is their religion says it all then why for what
Those are not russian jet fighters. They create too much smoke for MIG engine.
For fuck sake can we get a response attack tired of this potty narrative for Ukraine. Help them out with force not “we condemn the invasion on Ukraine” bullshit you’re words mean jack shit
I wonder how Putin will sleep tonight...🙁😥
dont worry some black americans from da hood and buck norris will save you ! HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA
So far there hasn’t been any reports how the Ukrainian forces are defending. It all seem to be quiet from the Ukrainian forces. Where are they! Russian tanks and jet fighters are roaming at will and Ukraine has becoming russian target practice since it started
War is not the solutin of this issue I am realy unhappy about Ukrainean in the war it would be more casualaty from civilian because we have this experence I pray for Ukriane from Afghanistan 😭😭
Probably  Reading hilter fanfiction that he wrote himself
God please save Ukrain people 🙏 😢
Go with god. Stay strong.
They only want the predominantly russian speaking areas
The devil luvs war & death, God help these ppl 🙏🙏🙏🙏 give them hope, faith & peace
✊🇷🇺❤️
This is sad innocent people being killed in the name of national security, people are the nation without people there is no nation. When will world leaders understand this.
Unless a nation's life faces peril, war is murder.  #StopWarMustafa Kemal ATATÜRK 🇹🇷
this is sad :( #StandWithUkraine
Only Vladimir Putin feels the need to defend himself against someone who's not attacking him.
Humanity started to wake up for Ukraine but was sleeping during Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam.. baby killer
We're is the West and NATO  . They are a toothless tiger . Lost of noise no bite . Russia  will do as it please
War virus that start from Middle East now coming to Europe  what you going to do now Russia using a  same reason when American invaded war
AAAHHHHHH.  The plot thickens.  The stage is set and the 
What kind of Putin's despotism are you talking about? Stop talking heresy. We did not foment this war. This is what the United States and the political elite of Ukraine are doing, they have long been brainwashed. Crimea has been part of the Russian Empire since the 17th century, not Ukraine, which was not even on the map then. And if the USA did not climb to our borders, putting their air defense bases everywhere against the imaginary aggression of the Russians, which does not exist and did not exist. Everyone knows what methods they use, and the word 
EVERYTHING IS STAGED BY THE WEST JUST LIKE THEY DID IN IRAQ.
God protect Ukraine 🙏🇺🇦🙏 much love from South Africa 🙌🇿🇦
I would like to see other countries expressing disagreement to what is happening in Ukraine...not just EU and USA! What is China saying about it? Other big countries? Nothing? Do they agree? Is this a plan to destroy Europe? It would be nice to know who are our allies and who wants us destroyed! So, when Europe gets out of this mess, we can make our business accordingly!Europe has to be united now more than ever!

What actually happen? Why Russian attack Ukraine?
Sorry for Ukraine but de should not trust de NATO n US blindly de r only good in words not in action Russia is Russia de can do anything Wat de won't n de have done .
NATO won’t get involved because it’ll escalate to WW3
temptation of Ukraine
Ukranians im with you in spirit may all this be over quick god bless all of you

How do you invade a country in self defence?
Ukraine is not a democracy first off. This war can be fully accredited to americas lack of leadership tailored by uncle Joe. Taking away americas energy independence lined Putons pockets with oil cash in order to do this.  Also Joes disgusting display of weekness in the Afghanistan dibacle gave him all the confidence that America would do nothing cause our leadership is a bunch of treasonous, cowardice, pathetic loosers
Always happens when you give one person too much power. This is going to end badly for both sides
I’m shitting my self I really do not want to go and fight 🥲
Save humanity
If this let happen then we will be soon face WWW 3.
china will be very happy to see white people fight and ruined everything... modern? have russia not learn about Myammar? General should be a president, not a spy.. strike back!!! either way you are gonna lose everything!! fight!!! this is war, is already here, not coming, is here... older generations dont deserve to be taken care. dont deserve it at all...!! their minds has not change.
USSR rebirth in the making.
The last thing this world needs is a War!
The only way to stop this is with western forces ie Nato to stand up to this aggression - even the populace is asking where is Nato?
From Yemen 🇾🇪 our prayer with Ukraine 🇺🇦 🙏🌷🙏🌷

The Ukrainians and NATO need to make this a Russian Stalingrad.  NATO should openly support not only the Ukrainian military, but partisans as well.  Ukraine needs lots of small arms and ammo,  shoulder fired AA and anti-tank weapons, and explosives.  They need to send 
To all Ukrainian be strong

THIS IS THE EVIL IRAQ STRATEGY OVER AGAIN. EVERYTHING IS STAGED TO FOOL THE WORLD.
Idc Europe deserved this tbh for not helping Iraq Afghanistan Libya etc putin is doing the right thing
Courageous women. Protesting while knowing that they’ll be arrested.
The Great War of distraction.
The allied forces should have contained the Russians behind the boarder..yet they go in to Iraq for no F.. reason.. 🙄
Good question where is NATO to help?
Atleast Putin's got balls to invade a country....
Oh God why
China is just waiting about the sanctions against Russia. If it won't affect China that much, then they will also start invading Taiwan too.
Jesus christ
1:03 BBC lies. Those damages could not have been caused by a rocket. A rocket would have destroyed the whole house. It looks like this house was fired by small-caliber artillery fire. I suppose this house is located in the Donbass, which was previously fired by Ukrainian troops.
No to war please..
The Nazi government of Ukraine, backed by the United States, carried out a coup in 2014 and seized power in Ukraine.  They ban the Russian language and have been bombing civilians in Donetsk and Lugansk for 8 years now, where the majority of the Russian-speaking population lives.  Our president has been waiting for 8 years for them to decide peacefully and agree that Ukraine remains a single state.  But the Nazi government of Ukraine does not need Russian-speaking people in this territory.  Civilians will not be harmed.  This is a peace enforcement operation and liberation from the fascist government of Ukraine.
It is so strange the western leaders kept talking about Russia invading ukraine for weeks and weeks as if they all knew and wanted to do nothing about it..i pray for the Ukraine people and lives lost 🙏🏽😥
Today our math teacher wasn t in the mood  he actually laugh a lot always seem happy but he couldn t hold it today he wasn t feeling well  and he told us that he is scared bc his son is there but also can t go back
The US and NATO asked for this through their continual insistence on Eastward expansion, not heeding Putin's warnings of 
Ok i get that russia wanna take ukraine due to it's past glory nd father land nostalgia but shouldn't that be have been put on a referendum? I don't understand why u wanna rule over 40million people who don't want you. Its so stupid
So is this the start of world war 3 ???💣💣⚔️⚔️💔💔🇷🇺vs🇺🇦
excellent reporting
honestly just end the world. nuke russia and let it play out
They should go to the front not protest 🤣
The words courage and brave have become a joke these days.Just shout something in public and u are courageous like wtf?These people can do ONLY these things, nothing else. All they know is to whine and shout on roads infront of world famous media networks who themselves are protected and all while being protected by actual fighters who are sacrificing their lives without much selfishness.
Just like in Canada.
You mean as courageous as their male counterparts that get shot at on the front line?
 @informant09  careful, u may bring their karen nature out on us.
 @J P  I know a bit about real courage & bravery. I had a bad drug addiction when I was a kid, my drug was adrenaline. Anything that scared me stupid was my preferred recreation. That led me to climbing vertical rock walls in Yosemite Park every day for about 2-3 months per year for about 20+ years, racing motorcycles & sailing a boat from Hawaii to San Diego (caught a hurricane halfway across, 50 knot winds & 40’ seas in a 41 foot boat. About a 9 on the old pucker meter). I also had occasion to save 4 strangers’ lives (out of 5 victims), getting seriously injured/altitude sick climbers down off of rocks & volcanoes. These women were not near the fighting, it looks like they were in some major city in Russia(likely Moscow). They could easily stayed at home & stayed out of trouble. You think that it’s no big deal to get arrested for protesting against the government’s actions, likely because you live in some country that protect freedom of speech & political expression. That does NOT apply to Russia. You protest against the government there, you likely go to jail, likely get put on a list of “dissidents”, lose your job & can’t get another one. As I said above, they could have just stayed home. They certainly knew that their protest was going to change nothing. Putin doesn’t give a rat’s ass that a few people might protest. But they went out to that public square anyway, because, to them, it was a matter of principle.When was the last time you faced the opportunity to sacrifice your career & freedom for strangers, as a matter of principle, and had the COURAGE to do so?
 @informant09  it must suck to come face-to-face with some women (the protesters) who have more courage in their pinkie fingers than you’ll ever know in your life. And, yeah, there are 1000s of Ukrainian women, of all ages, who are right beside the men, shooting & getting shot at, too.

Putin really said “self defence” even tho he started it
And were stuck here with Joe Biden
This is wrong. This must stop.
Where is the humanity? Leader of the world did not take any teach from world war 2. The evil and stupid decision make another world war. stoups all kind of  killing.
Prayers 😔🇺🇸🇺🇦
That's is so the most stupid things  ever the world is in economic crisis cause of Corona and now they bombing building and companys people can't work escaping it's so dumb.So unnecessary
Sick man power hungry
Ma la nato e l'ue ??

Is this BBC Bullsh.t again
Dear friend, genuine repentance and recitation of those words will protect you from coronavirus and calamities:
Where is dumb America
The End Is Near
Go Russia.

please stop war❤️❤️❤️❤️
The west wants a war with Russia.
Russia: Ukraine said this.. So I nuked them. I mean, ridiculous.. Ukraine is not a threat to Russia like N.Korea are currently not a threat to America.
You can't believe anything he says, he uses lying as a strategy
There is no end
Biden you're responsible for this war
✝️💔
WHERE IS THE MISSILE FLYING INTO UKRAINE.  THIS WHOLE THING IS STAGED
Well !, as this is bbc , we need to believe the very opposite of what we are being told here
Congratulations for this news report. Impecable. A public BBC is very needed across the world. Greetings from Portugal.
thank N.a.t.o i guess for putting their nose where they shouldn't
Stay strong Ukraine🇺🇦
Ukrainians were betrayed by USA N NATO...  Hate you cowards.  Ukrainians stay strong.. Love you all.. M praying for all of you...
Like dude has nothing else to do but start a war🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️ mannnnn go play golf or something
Compare to what US attacked Baghdad the first night, thus us like child play.
Pray for Ukraine 🇺🇦.  are with them🇦🇿🇺🇦💙.God bless them
History has proved countless times that there is no reason for the strong to attack the weak. Because of this, we have to strive to become stronger
Russia is not authorized to attack other countries only usa can attack who ever they want when ever they want.. And we support them by buying American iphones
There's no way any country in Europe can take on Putin and his henchmen.  The simple solution is the man and his associates.  This has and will never be a fair fight.
Military Industrial Complex rejoicing after months of having their cash spigots turned off when the war that they never wanted to end in Afghanistan finally ended.
Didn’t join NATO.. except full support from NATO when attacked? 🤔🤔
Do yall think if he died like the next day thw war will stop or still continue
We already know governments will never think about us WHY ALL THIS??? WHY??? Money??? Power??? Control over pieces of land??? God please save us 🙏🏽
Si vis pacem para bellum.
as a history nerd im terrified by the patterns im seeing like the fact the us pulled troops out of ukraine if russia thinks they can keep going or pushing we will have a 3rd world war and sanctions arnt enough for the game hes playing. this is the game hitler played and the soviets played in the cold war.
 @cass lane  Then you're a pretty bad history nerd, you equating Hitlers take overs with Russia's is pretty stupid considering that this problem has been brewing for years and the west was warned about this multiple times, hitler didn't do that with it's take overs, hitler was a cornered animal becoming a vengeful (and stupid) animal, Russia is a cornered animal lashing back at what seems like danger.
 @Agent C  you seriosly believe russia is invading a country in defence? and hitler didnt invade poland right away there were small actions leading up to every conquesy plus it isnt a exact compasision only a pattern. i feel this is a politicaly motivated responce.
 @cass lane  Notice that 
 @Agent C  there is somthing wrong with any argument when it starts with a grammer check lol. and seriosly you need to look at who you are supporting im not sure if your russian but this is just plain aggression nothing more. this is just insanity we live in a world of nukes.
 @cass lane  It wasn't a grammar check for you my guy, I was stating why I know that hitler didn't just take poland, this is not 
I listen to western media with 5 pinches of salt
Looks like America and NATO are just a paper tiger lol 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Love you Donbass ❤ ❤ ❤ You were brave, 8 years in hell. Be happy now  independent 🍀
Have been following Putin since last 30 years. Honestly, I did not think he will attack Ukraine especially now considering the threat of nuclear conflict is real more than ever.
where are the neo-nazi used to march in kyve city? with nazi salute all that.
It's all about double standards in the UN,  what USA and NATO did to Iraq,  Syria, etc was right and it seems bad to Ukraine and Russia. How many times many countries are forced into war because of military industrial complex? Then next is Taiwan and China? Let the double standards go to its peak. Unfortunately Ukraine is caught up in the thorns of sphere scrambling countries, very sad. People are dying in the expense of others businesses and in the name of democracy.  One sided medias and one sided righteousness leading the public thoughts
Prayers for Ukraine! This is Biden's fault! Biden just used Ukraine! Biden can't protect them! This is all Biden's fault! Biden was just using Ukraine to store strategic weapons against Russia there!
“This is the Kremlin war”, never heard that from the Whitehouse though, I’m American, and I do not endorse or support US initiatives on war.. I hope the salary is good
Press power
“Greed is the root of all evil.”The least that I can do is include Ukraine in my prayers especially the innocent civilians and Rest In Peace to those who passed.
Unrelated but Kiev has a beautiful metro station. Hopefully when things are better it will still remain beautiful.
Where was the West when Ukraine violated the Minsk agreements?

Seems to appear ??!? For God’s sake stop minimizing the F’ing obvious. It is called WAR.
Shame on Belarus  and his president  freaking  rats
My prayers are with the people of Ukraine 🇺🇦 and Russia Putins Tyranny most stop be tried with in War Crimes
Pray for Ukraine
Governments always harm the innocent. That is why we should not have them
Agreed
Yes, the greed of the West.
Greed and Pride.  My heart is with the Ukrainians.
Yes make sure you pray really hard, that usually works
Nobel Peace Committee are you seeing this?? This is what happens when you give Peace prize to a politician. Now Mr. Putin wants to show to the world who is the actual keeper of peace or on whose shoulders the peace lies safely in Europe. May be you should consider giving Mr. Putin a peace prize. Or a joint peace prize to Mr. Biden and Mr. Putin but that will surely bring Mr. Trump into picture and you should answer him as to why he should not be given the peace prize. So committee, in view of so many families being affected you should revise your policies...I wonder if a prize return from his rival politician will satisfy Mr. Putin's ego...
You deserve it Ukraine
I feel so bad for the innocent citzen's of Ukraine (and Russia since I've seen tik toks of people rioting and defending Ukraine with signs saying 
Ukraine should submit their weapons and embrace peace.
isreali occupation on Palistine is horrible too childrens are dying from morning to evening
Putin why kill,innocent Ukraine civilians God will purnish you.
6:55 no.... don't say this. nobody wants this
WHY DO YOU MEDIA STATION NOT SAY THAT IT WAS A MILITARY AIRPORT. IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE ACCEPT YOU MAKE IT LOOK LIKE THEY ATTACKED A PEDESTRIAN AIR PORT. JUST TELL IT HOW IT IS. I DONT AGREE WITH WHATS BEING DONE AS ITS KILLING INNCOENT PEOPLE BECAUSE AGAIN ITS TYRANYS AGAINST TYRANTS
Putin is soo brave!
MONROE DOCTRINE.....MEET PUTIN DOCTRINE!
I heart goes for Ukrainians...  I wish nobody on earth would have to face such things.    .. Russia I use to sympathize now m full of hatred for them .. Bloody Putin...
Western media double standard...you push Russia to the corner and you dont expect retaliation..mchew

Its disgusting that people support these actions on RT news youtube channel.the putin propaganda machine   thank you BBC for keeping to the facts!!
We stand with Russia.  #StandWithRussia  👍
People in the USA are crazy, they only know how to blame their President Biden.   Sad they let him live in their heads rent free.
the ever lying BBC war propaganda machine in full flow. Nato murderous mobsters destroy another pawn country. Regretting Maidan now huh  hha  Check out the great Soviet architecture and infrastructure tho !
What a wonderful world we have!
Here we go. Sad face 😢
What people failed to realize is that I am someone who was in a brutal civil war or war for 3 years, but during war I just want to remind everyone: THERE is always that constant FEAR of a violent DEATH! I don’t like war! Praying for PEACE!!
готовтесь американцы вы следующие
Good reporter; professional…unlike John Kerry who, in the midst of this crisis, is throwing a temper-tantrum, tearing, “ I’m concerned about the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, drawing attention away from me and my over-blown-hype about global warming!” Yeah, right Kerry, interesting that you and Obama bought houses next to the ocean in Martha’s Vineyard 😂😂😂… Historically speaking ( if the Nazi Leftist Party of Kerry let’s me say so ), there has never been a greater perpetrator of Exaggeration than John Kerry…..There is NO proof of Kerry EVER having helped rescue a stranded marine company in Vietnam. Meanwhile, Kerry and his Hollywood phoney-baloneys continue to over-pollute the world in their perpetual daily private jet flights !!!! So sad they can’t see this reality…cognitive dissonance to the Nth degree. Kerry should have simply said, “Let’s pray for both the Ukrainian and Russian people, that they are first of all physically safe, but secondly, that they do not have to wake up every morning the largely Left-Wing Nazi media and academia. ( Truth: Mussolini was a Leftist Socialist,  being the editor -in-chief of the Left-wing Socialist newspaper , “La lota di classe,” the struggle of the class, and subsequently the head of the Italian Socialist Party ( Leftist, following the ideals of Italian socialist Marxist Antonio Gramsci, and Giovanni Gentile, who birthed the concept of the Fasce/Fascist), and whom Leftist Socialist Hitler followed , with Hitlers Nationalist ( Nazi) Socialist Party . Put that in your Tea and eat it with your crumpet
What type of aggression has come from the Ukrainian border towards Russia other than building defenses?
Ukraine People should go to uk or us.
KREMLIN’S WAR…CCP WAR is Coming SOON!!!!!!!
The same barbaric way NATO 👹 attacked Iraq in 1991, Belgrade in 1999, Afghanistan in 2001, Iraq in 2003, Lybia in 2011 and Syria in 2011 to date. What shameless are US, NATO and allies👹🙉, just pray for peace 🤝 for everyone 🙏🙏
Good!!! Shame!!! You did this to your selfs..MR BIG TOUGH NATO!! you didn't want to respond to Russia and give them security promises! Fuck BBC for pushing a Lie!!
Jesus Christ we know it says in the Bible we're going to hear about wars and all this other stuff you are coming sooner than we think please help these people that are trying to live a life and I hope there's a lot of brothers and sisters in Christ that don't die Jesus Christ protect that city
Putin you. Are a amazing Sigma
I’m not saying the fear and safety of Ukraine isn’t important. But now I’m scared too. All the way over here in southern U.S. Like….this legit is happening. It’s REALLY happening. This isn’t a movie, or a game, or CGI faked footage. It has me thinking, realistically, what’s to stop this from getting worse? How can I be certain I’m safe over here? Yeah politics and economics and yatta yatta. But REALLY, he can easily launch those missiles to the U.S, or Britain, or Germany idfk.
Well, now we know who the next Hitler is.
Allies alike bomb Russia off the face of the earth the political war isn’t going too work, Putin is another Hitler he must be stopped. FUCK RUSSIA AND EVERYONE WHO SUPPORTS THEM BUNCH OF SCUMBAGS
Życie człowieka w dzisiejszych czasach i tak było trudne covid ceny paliw nawózów i itd w bo jestem rolnikiem teraz rosja.Nierozumiem jak w dzisiejszym cywilizowanym świecie mogą dziać się takie żeczy? Jedna osoba może decydować o życiu lub śmierci i fnansach i przyszłości całych społeczeństw
It makes sense. Putin can't allow his people to see how good citizens of Nato countries have it, and it would be unavoidable if they shared such a large boarder.
This is not an invasion, but the disarmament of the criminal, fascist army of Ukraine, the Russian military does not touch civilians! Ukrainian criminals have been killing residents of Donbass for eight years... OPEN YOUR EYES, DO YOU BELIEVE TV ?!
For me Putin is doing the right thing. During the end of the Cold War, there was an agreement that no more Nato Expansion but the Nato and west don’t adhere to this agreement and try to take all the countries that are bordered with Russia , this create a threat to Russian Sovereignty. Ukraine is used to be a buffer or neutral country between the west and Russia and now nato are planning to take Ukraine as a member of their organization, of course Russia need to take action.
This is absolutely horrible. I can’t believe this is really happening. Prayer for the civilians🙏
WWII & NOW !As war is fought it takes chargeAnd events spin out of control.The madness of men can alter the soilwhich nourishes the roots of their soul.Many things will forever changeFar more then wished to be.As the wrath of war starts to destroyThose things we fight to keep free.War is the greatest plague of man,Religion, state and sanity.Any scourge is more preferredThan the one which disables humanity.When war breaks out, boundaries changeAnd all who die are a tokenOf the rage that must run its courseBefore words of peace are spoken.It’s not a priest that gives us our freedom of religionAnd it’s not a reporter that gives us our freedom of voice.It’s not any judge, lawyer, politician, preacher or teacherBut the blood of a soldier that has sacrificed by choice.By Poet Tom ZartGoogle = Most Published Poet On The WebTom’s 1,650 Poems Are Free To Share!Google = George Bush Tom Zart
what is world crime tribunal going to do about it? put this dictator on trial!crime against humanity! killing innocent people, men, women , children due to war invading a territorial integrity and Sovereignty of a  state country.Not to mention waves of waves of war refugees flooding the neighbour countries.  send out arrest warrant for him! let Interpol arrest him!
God bless Putin and long live Russia and Ukraine.Slavic brothers. Remove the puppet junta and bring Ukraine back to Russia
In Australia and Canada you can be arrested for protesting in the street now , the same in Netherlands, Belgium and Germany . Russia tried to get the Minsk agreement implemented however, Kyiv refused and attacked the  Donbas  the result is that Russia cannot keep watching ethnic Russians killed . The EU and NATO are to blame here.......
Hmm I didn’t know this, but idk if this justifies the civilians that he’s killing
I can believe it kinda see it coming along way off. I think everybody could
Yeah surebut Even even soldiers are human and they have family too
 @Pati G  soldiers r literally just civilians brave enough to defend their country
Prayers for everyone.   This is so unnecessary.
Y'all said Nazis were everywhere. He's fighting them. His own words.
They should not include civilians and they said they don't aim for them but they obviously did...its breaking my heart. Hopefully this ends soon and DOES NOT start somewhere else in the world soon..
It feels like Iraq all over again.
We want justice for afghanistanrWe want justice for iraqrWe want justice for libiyarWe want justice for syriano impunity for Americans and their war crimes
So which is it people on the right? Should we stand up to Russia or stay out because it’s not our battle? Biden weak? It was Trump who praised and defended Putin, withdrew the sanctions on Russia, opposed the existence of NATO. Sided with a dictator. This is no different than when Hitler invaded Hungary and Czechoslovakia with the excuse that there were German speakers there. England signed a treaty with Hitler and Hitler promised to stop there. He didn’t. Nor will Putin. NATO or no NATO, Russia wants to build back it’s empire.
Whos to blame?
When u chop ppl s heads off and call it self defense, it is a strong statement to the rest of the world.
There is a video from some years back where a girl asks putin what was his biggest regret and he said the fall of the ussr so what he is trying to do is rebuild the ussr.
Bidon was a little late. There was urgent need for a change:Of his diapers.
Stay strong from Estonia
They didn't hit civilian targets but military installations and China is 24 hrs live broadcast via high resolution satellites over Ukraine making sure no 
Thanks Biden
If my country put out an optional draft I would 100% sign up
Fc*k Russia!
My heart goes out to all the Ukrainians ❤️
Ukraine's army is already crumbled.And there will be no one to save them.This is the time of their destruction.
whoever starts a war must be held accountable
The West started this. Now the Ukrainians will pay the price. Just another war where Western arms manufacturers can clean up. Same as Iraq, same as Syria, same as Afghanistan and Libya
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Go russia 🇷🇺 the motherland
Is it politically correct to call Vladimir Putin a murderer?Stay strong people! 🇭🇷
No immunity for corrupt Russian dictators
How about  Donbass ?
 @Ирина Лукьяненко  Donbas is in Ukraine.
 @Dylan Johnson   So, Ukrain  had the right to shell it?
 @Ирина Лукьяненко  they weren’t shelling, it was Russia that was lying about them shelling so they could have a pretext to invade.
 @Dylan Johnson  Take your TV to the rubnish  dump Who are you going to argie?I am from Crimea I used to live in Ukraine I know what this state  is capable of doing Besides, manyeople from Donbass  moved to Cromea because of shelling They sire knoe  where  it was ftom
Is it politically correct to call you a mindless, ignorant sheep who brain is so simple and basic that they cannot perform their own research and will take everything their warmongering government say as face value? Sheep.
Becoming another Hitler is gonna create ww3
Don't worry the Bidens will bail you out 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
At 2:59 those two jets are russian su-25s
I cherish peace with all of my heart. I don't care how many men, women and children I kill to get it.
Invades a country.'It's self defence.'Ok then Putin.
would russia's goal be to kill civilians they wouldn't live anymore wouldn't it?
UKRAJNA IS A FASCIST COUNTRY.! VIVAT PUTYIN, VIVAT RUSSIA.!
putin says 
For the last 24hour ..there are also attack on Somalia by usa, Syria by Israel and Yemen by saudi arabia... Do reports on it also
I don't beleive the world is seating and letting Puttin destroy this country.
It’s so unfortunate hope this will be over soon and no one gets hurt anymore I wish for world peace we don’t need another world war
Pray for Ukraine, fuck off all war! Peace! <3
NEVER JUDGE A MAN ON HIS WORDS BUT HIS ACTIONS!
Got damn thatvwas hella personal, telling them uhuh stay and face your fate or even run all you want but we're coming for you
You european should pressure your governments to answers, to fight against this war, and for peace. It's so unfair to see what Russian are doing with Ukraine.
Funny how Russia only advances when there is a Democrat in the White House. Just saying!
Ameticans must run away from Kyiv
Another fulmy grown adult with 0 brain power to think for themselves. How can one make such a comparison when Putin isn't out to mass murder anyone.FACT: The west has been placing military units in Ukraine for decades. Do you really believe the same nations who still leech off stolen African and Indian resources without trading, who has had the most amount of wars within the past century alone, who treats its poor and other races as second class citizens, are to be trusted? This world is coming to an end because of sheep like you. You let your elite get away with crime after crime and look at where we are now...on the brink of WW3.
Those are NOT SU-25's. SU-27 Flankers or SU-33's. Also, they may not be Russian since the Ukraine (same damn nation little over 25 years ago) has Russian planes in their military also.
SU25 is the Frogfoot, one air support jet. These are Flankers, air superiority fighters.
He learned from the best country in the world
 @Daniel Kirpichnikov  so true 😂
do you see any missiles in Mexico or Canada ?  what did the US do when USSR put nukes in Cuba ?
Ukraine started the conflict, Russia started the fight, the world stayed aside. People suffers. Nobody's right
So you are saying, that the all 
 @Daniel Kirpichnikov  they always were
 @Daniel Kirpichnikov  yes actually they are america was promising to georgia that they would join nato and then nato said a big no ....then russia invaded georgia and occupied 20% of the country both are trash
 @Света Пономарева  Ukraine never started the conflict, Putin set this up and planned for years. Putin literally wants his USSR lands back. This man is evil.
 @nilsthatboi  Yes
Remember Iraq, Libya, Sirya? Oh, that is different: High and Mighty were on the roll.Russia doesn't want NATO bases next to its borders. Neither do I. Yankee, go home.
Russia should used Nuclear Bomb to solve Ukraine issues .
Us lier
Appealing to the international xommunity.Who appeals to the international community when the UK and USA terrorise the likes of Yemen and many ither nations on this planet. Between the two they have the most amount of wars on this earth.What the Western media aren't reporting is what they've been doing to antagonise Russia. To all you drones and sheep. Do your research.
To all Ukrainian people. Hold fast. Russian attack is barbaric and inhumane, especially for attacking civilians. And they say that whoever attacks them, they will get punished. And those things about denazification, that is just a LIE. They do this just to capture the Ukraine. And you know, we only say 
Come on Putin you hero !! 😂😂😂
UKRAJNIANS TERRORISING THE HUNGARIANS IN UKRAJNA..!! DID YOU KNOW THAT PEOPLE.? UKRAJNA IS NOT EVEN A VALID COUNTRY. IT IS CREATED BY FRANCE, AND A BIG PART OF HUNGARY HAS BEEN TAKEN BY UKRAJNA.!
The United States Of America created Islamophobia there were no Strang Muslim countries to answer the satanic game plan of USA  ,now the same America created Russophobia but didn't realize Russia is a super power they will punch America in the face, Ukranians and Russians lived 1000s 9f years what was the need foe USA to create all these problems, now Russoa attack I feel bad for people of Ukrain but where is America why dont they help Ukrain, this is how USA play game ,don't trust USA,
Sounds like Trudeau defending against Nazis.
Team 🇺🇦 fuck Putin fuck Russia
U(USA,western) look like u care about Ukraine 🇺🇦  like u did everywhere (Syria,Libya,....countless names)so called media's,so much for telling the truth,hypocrites
How come ukrainians dont blame ukraine president?
Solution ukrainian  is surrounded
Thank God we still have America!!!
He don't love his own countrymen and women, go too another country and destroy their love for country and citizenship! Tragic, Tragic, and a madman cynicism!
NATO shits on Russia's doorstep.well . well
The Invasion is only taking place as a smoke screen, an excuse to begin the worldwide internet hack and reset. Part of the world economic forums next phase of the new world order rollout. Sanctions on russia is simply designed to create the backlash by russia via hacking the net - as if Putin is getting back at the countries that put sanctions on him. hahaha Klaus Schwabs plan is so open and obvious now.
eat en up Mr BEAR
If Putin is not stopped in the Ukraine this war would be the beginning of third world war. 👏👏
Ok so Putin doesn't want the people to travel out of Ukraine. So he is targeting people. I am guessing he doesn't want to rule an empty country. But still they could escape across the border.
It's unfortunate what happens in Ukraine to our brothers Ukrainians and Russians, but Russia is only doing what western countries have been doing for the past 30 years. They totally ignored the demands of Russia, now they'll pay for it.
 @Stefan Gligorić  Even ol' Zbigniew adviced to treat Russia with respect, as any defeated mightly and honest adversary deserves it. But history teaches us, that any victor gets blinded first by his success.
I don’t believe in violence or war. But, I only wish someone would stop him by poison
End time
Fuck Russia
Russia gonna get hit next
Wheres nato now🤣
Wow Russia entered Ukraine unopposed just like talaban entered Khabul, on the other hand when US invades Afghanistan  and Iraq the situation was different every one risisted. Makes me wonder 🤔 all the reports of civilian taking up arms and military saying they will fight to death was just western propaganda.just like how US says Iraq has democracy and Afghanistans military will stop talaban.
My heart goes out for all the innocent citizens of Ukraine .....sending love from 🇿🇲🕯
I Hope Russia will not attack on civilian
Denazification? Maybe if Vladolf Putler fucks off back to his country then it's job done.
Isn't the Ukraine President a jew? and he really called him a nazi lol
Putin got the economy goin a little bit thinks he’s gonna take over the world
Sickening is all I can say.It's the innocent civilians who suffer the most when the higher powers decide they want to try out their new toys and take over other lands.
at least Russians send troops, America just drops bombs
no public has a say in any country look at the so called free canada when the governments squash free protest and attack it's citizens savory for all in the world elite bankster gansters need to control the people of the world
TAKE OUT PUTIN ALONG WITH HIS ORANGE STAIN TAKE THEM OUT NOWWW!!!!!!!!! TAKE BOTH OF THEM OUT ALL OF THIER FAMILY MEMBERS TAKE THEM OUT BIDEN 2024LETS GO JOSE🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸😂😂💙🇺🇸😂❤️❤️❤️❤️🇺🇸💙💙❤️🇺🇸😂❤️🇺🇸🤧💙🤧💙🤧💙🤧🤧🇺🇸😂🇺🇸💙🤧💙🤧💙🤧
I don't trust a word that comes from the BBC they go on about propaganda and dictatorships in other countries and do exactly that themselves.
man what should I say
This is craziness from Putin. Why nobody stops him. Whole Europe has to come in to fight and stop this bullying. I can’t believe how it works in modern Europe. If you’re not a part of Europe Union we don’t care. If you’re not in Nato, we don’t care. What about preventing what Hitler done and stop Putin at roots. Putin will not stop at Ukraine. There will be next former Soviet Union countries what Putin wants to invade and add back to his big map. Stop him.
Wow, protest in Russia end the same way as they do in Canada. Horrible.
Love Zambia 🇿🇲 from UK 🇬🇧 my heart goes out to all the Ukrainians also
Putin is a liar and an awful man
How can we allow one man and his ego cause so many deaths and disruption around the world? Those who die are just pawns of the war of greed. So wrong.
Come on ukraine, the world is with you 💜
If Ukraine was a threat like Putin’s hoe ass said, why’d you attack it? Let’s get rid of Russia. Trash em.
Same story as ISRAEL and PALESTINE!! ISREAL has always been EVIL but no one sees its attrocities! GOD is watching!
Self defense my ass! Putin is a megalomaniacal  dictator. And Biden is a weak ass frat boy grifter. God help Ukraine. 😢
Where is the NATO , where is United state of America, where’s Uk , I don’t think they are coming and save Ukrainian because they were threatening to Russia 🇷🇺, but now everything is changed Rest and peace to Ukrainian people 💀💀💀💀
Ukraine IS NOT DEMOCRATIC
Ukrainian people are being attacked!! End this now!This is exactly what we have been waiting for. Evil is on the March and Putin is starting a world war here. I know plenty of soldiers who will be effected by this monster's actions.
God is so Great
Where is NATO...
Notwithstanding that a third of Ukraine see's itself as Russian how can you talk about democracy and human rights when you pass a law that prohibits the Russian language and culture?
I would jus give russia Ukraine let them have it
Usa is guilty for it..
Widnes
bbc never biased - ''snarling russian leader''  lol this reporter has taken emotive language to the next level . calm down buddy. israelis do this to palestine and you back them and support them , hypocrites
why people get emotional now..why not when Myanmar civilians were killed by military juntas, why not when USA invade Iraq , Syria in the name of terrorism..
Hit them hard mr Putin, those nazis bandera ukrops !!!

Let's NATO join then nuclear Missile fight begin
“The ultimate weakness of violence is that it is a descending spiral, begetting the very thing it seeks to destroy. Instead of diminishing evil, it multiplies it. Through violence you may murder the liar, but you cannot murder the lie, nor establish the truth. Through violence you murder the hater, but you do not murder hate. In fact, violence merely increases hate...Returning violence for violence multiplies violence, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.” Martin Luther King Jnr
You should've took diplomacy over beating your chest for the US and NATO.
Looks like  Israel killing children
Very sad.
The world can stop it by putting major economic sanctions on Russia. It's better for the world to suffer economic hardships then suffer  deaths due to war if putin escalates even more.
I’m praying for you Ukraine, Putin is sheer evil . Stay strong
Putin's lost a lot of credibility by targeting civilians.Let's hope that cooler heads prevail in the NATO ranks and that there is no retaliation.
Ukraine has never been a democracy
The world is coming to an end. When everyone will think of his pride, greed and ambitions only, this is bound to happen. What's the use of upcoming technologies and advancements when the people themselves are not civilized?
The same way CHINA is about to invade TAIWAN and AMERICA won't do anything
What does this idiotic Putin want to achieve from this stupid behaviour of his? I stand by Ukrainians.
Where is NATO forces and U.S forces for innocent people?
If u r here supporting Ukraine (just like me) but you never supported Palestine,Syria,Libya,Iraq,,,,, count yourself as a hypocrite!!!Peace to the WORLD!
The ukranians going underground sounds like the london blitz in WW2 all over again. I feel very sorry for the parents and children who have to grow up in this.
History will remember this for all abhorrent evil it is. Love and prayers to all the people of Ukraine 🇺🇦 🇬🇧
Damn world,we are allowing Natas to overcome,Democracy!
It begins
The end has just begun
Ukraine had the chance to choose peace, but chose to follow the orders of Russia's historic enemy, the US. For every choice there is a consequence.

What  about people  in Donbass ?
 @Ирина Лукьяненко  To be clear, my sympathy and prayers go to any civilian caught-up in violence be it Russian, Ukrainian, British, American, Muslim, Christian or Jew. Human life is precious my friend, as is your life. Peace, love  and respect.
 @Earl E. Bird  Civilians are not shelled in Ukraine, military objevts only  Besidrs, Rusdian minister of Defence  ordrd to treat  the Ukrainian military  men who surrender  woth respect But thst  is not about the naxi forces   They came to Donbass yo kill and wrre extremely cruel
 @Ирина Лукьяненко  Like I said, my feelings go out to anyone, irrespective of their geographical location, who is suffering at the hands of an aggressor. We know the the British don't have a great track record either? What is important is that we learn from history and don't listen to every word the media (be it the BBC or RT) spews out. I have friends who are Russian and for the record, would stand up for them too if they were facing an aggressor. Peace is what we all need....
Yawn
 @Earl E. Bird  Sure, we need peace  for all of us
While not pleasant, it's a long way from 
 @Terry Bridge  ‘not pleasant’ 😳
 @Earl E. Bird  War sucks...hence the unpleasantness.
 @Ирина Лукьяненко  putin troll
We are Indians I hope Narendra Modiji will Succeed in Stopping War❤️
🤨
Propaganda where is the evidence off civilians being attacked & I’m not on Russia’s side but let’s be honest
Excellent reporting despite the dangers involved. Thanks!
why didn’t you show how Ukraine bombed Donbass over the past 8 years?
The Ukrainian president should request NATO assistance, asking them to fire missiles at Russian warplanes entering Ukrainian airspace. NATO is attacking Ukrainian airspace, Russia has nothing to say, and Putin does not dare to attack NATO. If the Russian army cannot gain complete air supremacy, it will not be easy to fight on the ground, so that it can be exhausted to the death of the polar bear.
This is horible ,my heart is my brother and sister 1999 nato bomb serbia 😠😠😠😠😠😠
The world is crazy
history repeats itself
https://youtu.be/rkx_MNm-UHYPutin’s Speech on the US years ago
Tears and prayers 😢🙏🏿
nato is the problem and they’re afraid to admit it
you only asked three people? you couldn't find any people in for putin come on. what are you fake media
Ukraine 🇺🇦 is Russia 🇷🇺 ‼️
عااااش بوتين🤙

Putin is evil.
😭😭😭
It seems to me that the majority of the citizens in any given country declaring war on another country, regardless of their given reason, are opposed to it. Funny how that seems to be a recurring tone…exempting a few certain causes that imo truly did merit such an action. I mean as a Native American descendant I feel the annihilation of over 60 million Native Americans would’ve merited it. 🤷🏻‍♂️ js
Our lives don’t matter and your gods have left, humanity is doomed, long live our evil, our collective is nigh inevitable, there is no surviving
thank your politicans for teaming up with the imf and the west bankers some countrys are tired of gangsters ruling them I'm from canada democracy = savory
If the invasion is so massive then show us. Seams far more likely that Americans and Ukraine started shooting and Russia responded
Why hasn't he's been label a terrorist 🤔 yet
Russia will have a forever enemy on their border.
Here we go again.  So sad for the people of Ukraine that they will have to endure this.
We all know your news service lies.....so will be sure not to watch.....

Wars and rumors of wars. APTTMH
Only exclude Russia with SWIFT make Putin suffer. The rest of sanctions make him smile
Peace is a fool's paradise. Humans can never coexist with peace. War is the bitter reality. You all should learn to live with it
4:55 this is what a real man looks like.
lol prepared to sort newspaper. you will be like afghanistan vice president being delivery boy in germany.you pay for what you done with evil eu.time to cry time to mourn for your brazen act cheating in election
Trump hasn't even been out of office for 2 full years and the world falls apart.
I’m sorry but I think it’s time for the U.S to go to war again.

 @Kendra  they wouldn’t be fighting you and willing to die in that fight if they wanted to be part of Russia.  They clearly would rather have democracy and prosperity.  I see what you are saying though.  I don’t believe Ukraine has started any problems with Russia other than trying to keep itself a free country.
 @Kendra  are you part of the Russia cyber team?

This happens when US, Canada and other countries just bla bla bla. A lesson for every country ( North Korea) to never give up their nuclear weapons. If I have a lion next door and I have a rifle, why I will give up my rifle under promises from someone to protect me from thousands of miles away?
This is so horrible. My heart and prayers go out to Ukraine 🇺🇦. Stay strong and safe out there. ❤🙏
Maybe ANTIFA and BLM can go rush into Russia and cry about fascism and racism issues. Because, that will fix everything. Then again, most of those people are snowflakes and would run and cry their eye's out with seeing bombs heading their way, not realizing how good they have it here in the USA... Just be aware, this war, if not stopped soon, WILL spill into the USA, with us having all these gender freak entitled leftist youngsters, and most due to the weakest EVER president the USA has ever had. The USA is being laughed at. We are self destructing internally with all the recent riots and crying over pronouns and manufactured racism.
Ukraine is Russian territory, it is not an autocephalous government administration that is going to change that, accepting Ukraine into NATO is the same as putting American troops on Russian territory, these damn organizations think they are carriers of the truth, the false idea of ​​a league of justice created a kind of disguised imperialist tyranny, Russia could implant a pro-Russian government in Texas, and send thousands of Russian immigrants to the US and over time they would use the principle of freedom and self-determination of the people to adhere to the warsaw pact , and the US would clearly accept that right?
A castrated UN,castrated NATO,And casanovas are running wild.
Ukrain is finished , accept it
How kind of Belarus to let them in...
Putin says that Ukraine is a treat to his people yet he's the one threatening civilians and killing people his the worst and deserves punishment
Need to Shutdown Russian Central Reserve  Bank Swift System,No Money in-No Money Out-Game is Over and Putin is done.
The bombs aren't random, they hit military areas and there's some civilian casualties, it's not like Nazis who got everyone
Payback for WOŁYŃ MASSACRE 1942-43 UKROPS!!!
My problems is not the rich and politics, my problems is the poor civilians
God bless you all the people Ukraine...we are with you..Love from india🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
Poke the Bear long enough, don't be surprised when he bites you!
It's time for the US to take the gloves off and impose stark and deadly costs on Russia.
Stop feeding people GARBAGE with your False news. hail Russia 🇷🇺💪💪💪💪
Ukraine should have not trusted in The US and its friends.
This is a war against the democracy
As an american I would like to apologize to Ukraine on behalf of the U.S and NATO for our inaction. Obviously sanctions have done nothing to deter russia. There needs to be a military response. Russia obviously will only respond to one thing, Power.
We Serbs,love Putin.He is our hero.
Let's pray for a quick take over for Russia to keep casualties low
As Indians, we should support Russia 🇷🇺
That means nuclear war
Gaza was bombed and no one was willing condemn Israeli terrorism.Fake human rights concerns of West is just bullshit.....Hypocrite prapoganda masters
Dude attacked civilians and called it self defence, no way in the world anyone will negotiate with a terrorist.
And evil serves the devil again.  Our leaders are devil worshipers killing in the name of death.  A threat used for control.  They are no better than the killers they are trying to kill.  INNOCENT VICTIMS BLOOD Cries out FROM THE  GROUND.  Either way they are just killing people.  THOU SHALL NOT KILL
Ofcourse sending all the power to Ukraine but also a great shoutout to journalists who are risking their lives at the moment to let the world know whats happening. Kudos
The fact that the Russians say they will not shoot civilians and shoot civilians, causing a refugee problem on behalf of countries, is an indication of how dishonorable it is. This will not be limited to Ukraine (Poland)
Wheres James Bond when you need him?
This generations kids ones that are 25 an older lived through a market crash, a pandemic, 9/11, operation Desert Storm, and now this. No wonder why we so fucked up.
Wait until the people find out who is really bombing Ukrainian because it’s not Putin, this person is a CGI
Stupid Russia. What is wrong with you and my dad is there in his bunker please God help look after my   father and will be better Russia it’s all your fault it’s just stupid coI don’t want to come to your country Ukraine Should attack you first  because my Dad is strong and healthy is this war finish my dad has to drive out from Ukraine to Poland end after that to France take a ship to England
All of us needs to be worried it's the beginning of something very devastating 😞 💔 😢
Has tanks and rockets surrounding Ukraine then says he felt threatened??? How!?!?
war is war
So much for support Ukraine from the US and NATO. Look like the US and NATO pee in their pants now.  Sorry Ukraine, you're on your own now. Lesson to learn here. Never listen to the US or NATO to give up your Nuke. This would never happen if Ukraine didn't give up their Nuke.
The way I see it is people need to worry about there own country and not others and if biden and Harris doesn't get out of office and quit causing trouble with other countries then we will be in the same shape
Death to Russia
This is Biden & NATO's war! 🙄🇷🇺
My anger and rage is untamed watching this play out. I pray for the families falling victim to these horrible actions this irate dictator is taking. Stay strong you have the whole world on your side rooting for you. #Pray4Ukraine
Why war...shit..
They were warned and yet gave no heed . They were caught as the saying goes with their pants down.  Serves them right, they should have been ready yet they were bombed and now being attacked. Smh, some people just never learn.
Yea those green screens can get pretty dangerous.
I want to kill myself
He was not snarling grow up.
This never happened under trump
Biden betrayed Ukraine, really I miss Trump 😭 He won't fear like Biden.Before Biden betrayed Afganistan now he did same for Ukraine.
You could have joined NATO in 2008, you dragged your feet? Now look at you!
God bless unite this two countries 🙏
Draw him in and make him regret it
War always destroyed the humanity...Russia must stop the craze of war and it's nonsense act that leads the peaceful country towards big big human crises.
Russia president is very stupid
Prayers for Ukrainian people. 🙌🏼 Love from South Africa 🇿🇦
Well...How will Ukraine respond?  Much as it pains me to say this. This is a time when we need H.W. Bush in office...
This is not the Russian people's war but Kremlin's war....sounds very familiar.....we in the U.K felt exactly the same in 2003 when our nation was involved in the illegal invasion of Iraq...it wasn't the war of the British people but the war of Whitehall....sadly the BBC forgot to mention it back then
I hope NATO steps up, they need to-- this is insane, a dictator has just invaded a country. The allies need to oppose Putin with full force and with all the resources of the west available.  This has to be done otherwise he will not stop.edit: internally we need to turn the Russian people against Putin (not difficult). One good Russian might help the world out, and no one would complain.
Sad
We are with Ukrain ☑️
Putin just wants to show his power… very little tho
Proppoganda proppoganda why did the West make Ukraine a Nato country? They want the uranuim and minerals now Putin want it back now you cry whose fualt is it? NATO
да здравствует россия и да здравствует путин нахуй украину
Where is nato and there army and where is the Ukrainian army ?
Stingers
What will prayers do?
You have a point
Powerful, believing prayer, that is strategic and led by the Holy Spirit.. has changed nations in the past. We are with you in the Spirit people of Ukraine
Fuck you guys for south African you are xenophobia country
 @Senoritabeatmymeata  A lot but people like you is why stuff like this happens, if everyone believed then nothing will happen.
 @Senoritabeatmymeata  more than you will
 @Junior Panid  shut up
We Indians support Russia. Long live Russia

Christianity wake pray for peace and love to this  killer deal war to innocent people victims of Politics affairs and billionears who created lies and wars
Well ig Putin tryna get his 30 kill streak for a nuke 🤷‍♂️
Words help nothing.... Where do I sign up... I'll defend Ukraine and Ukrainians...
We must destroy this tyrant Putin and any other dictator,god bless Ukrainians on this dark day,good will prevail.
Stop war. People need peaceful life to live
Worlg Wap3 has begun.  Covid and now this, here comes the MWO and yes it’s wrong abbreviation so it doesn’t get taken down
Those were some brave ass Russians saying shit like that on national television
My money is on Russia. Place your bets now 🤣. Imagine those countries appearing like Iraq, Libya, Syria etc. The collateral damage and losses like they had. #bringthewarhome
is 3:13 reporter standing in front of green screen?
Do Russian civils agree with this? Does Russia agree? The people. Do they agree?
Politicians must be swiped out.
I want to hear the Story where is nato?
Putin is not the only player in this war. Shame on all of them
A leak about Putin's true plan.https://youtu.be/GsRNuncp2hM
Why young military age males are running away? They need to fight.
We don’t need this on the back of COVID it’s not fair on the people
So what is the useless nations plan on doing? Nothing? Shocker
Putin is crazy and has lost any credibility in the world.  Anyone with any knowledge of history knows this is a farce as far as what Putin claims is reason to invade another country. Be aware, this is just the beginning of a crazy autocrat who is still pissed about WWII and Stalin agreeing to the borders, etc. He's been pissed this entire time. He has lost his mind!  I hope the Ukranian people can withstand this war. Thinking of them all today and praying for peace in Ukraine. De-natizify? Seriously Putin?...you are Hitler now!
Funny how this co insides with the week that all  covid restrictions are lifted few weeks ago was talking about mandatory vaccines but now that’s swept under the rug  , used as smokescreen I reckon, shouldn’t be labelled as anti vax but instead pro choice, secondly we are forced to believe that we are the good guys and Russia are the bad guys but of course it’s going to be like That because the BBC are bias, throwing media in your face all the while to make you believe what they want , my view is we shouldn’t be getting involved be adding fuel to a fire in a fight what’s not ours , we would be the ones starting war not them.
Love Ukraine and feeling so sad for innocent people in Ukraine😢💜
May allah protect you all
Not self defense if they are attacking on land that isnt theirs
Did you hear Zelensky saying 'our democratic world'? What did Ukraine's Far Right did to the elected government in 2014? With the help of the West they mounted a coup and seized power. Was that democratic?
Pliz don't sanction on Russia Bank and trade
looks like stalker isnt gonna launch  bummer
I heard bts army tryna calm down the war where they at?
I am so sorry. This is heartbreaking. The fear, the trauma, the uncertainty.It's so shocking that this is the way things have to happen.
WHAT HAS OUR WORLD BECOME TOO ? RIP TO MANY PEOPLE  😥
Totalitarin Putin wants to stay in power longer willing to kill innocent lives. What a sicken madness in the 21st century ..!
Russian people are against this war. But nobody will listen to us. Stay strong, hope the protests in Russia will do something ❤
We are all human being. So, please stop this war🙏
Wtf? Please stop 🛑 this says so much about how folks can’t even work shit out without violence.
Peace and love for Ukraine.
I pray for the Ukrainians 🙏🏾🙏🏾♥️and all of us😪😪😢sending love and prayers from Jamaica 🇯🇲♥️🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾♥️♥️🇯🇲God help us
I pray for the Ukrainians 🙏🏾🙏🏾♥️and all of us😪😪😢sending love and prayers from Jamaica 🇯🇲♥️🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾♥️♥️🇯🇲God help us
russia is enemy of the world
Funny how putin is calling it liberation when Russia is an authoritarian nation and Ukraine is moving towards a more democratic nation. If the international Militaries intervened, russia could havr been stopped in its tracks.
This is nothing compared to stuff happening in Kashmir.
This is make me feel so sad 😞 🙏
It is good to hear the Russians say they don't want this war
Man I want all the uk soldiers and their allies to attack Russia
Putin wants to 
should the world allow this? maybe we should remove russia permanently, russia first, then china, at some point someone has to stop them all, the ones in power are barely human beings
Same was in Serbia in '99.
This is so sad😰 sending love and prayers to all of ukraine from norway🇧🇻❤🇺🇦
Make a video from the cemeteries of the graves of all children in Donbas and Lugansk and children who lost their arms and legs under the bombs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine for 8 years.
Destroy Moscow airports and ports also. My heart is aching to Ukrainian civilians and the hundreds of military people who lost their lives.
This is Trump's doing for some reason! I'm not sure what he did but Trump started this war some how!
you're beautiful 😍
Russia will come to you after Ukraine, it is not limited to this
Prayers 🙏🙏🙏🙏 for people children, families Elderlies
“Mankind must put an end to war before war puts an end to mankind”-John F. Kennedy
First time I've seen neo-liberals give a shit about white people in years. I can hardly believe it.
This is really mean.
Make him earn every inch!
Западное дерьмо переживает за мирных жителях, я чуть не блеванул.
I want to see people with other opinions too.this is only propaganda, not that I like Putin but this is just too much.A lot of people are happy because Russia went into Ukraine.but I am not happy!
Tell Americans to lift off or towed their Missiles that was parked around Russia border countries.
fight for your country
At 2:52, those are Ukrainian F-15 fighter jets.
Not even genocide will move NATO to help
Russia, China, North Korea and pretty much the entire middle east needs to be gone, then we would really have true world peace. Or rather, as close as we could get.
God bless these poor people pray for peace #no to war
God bless Vladimir Putin for cleaning the beautifull country of Ukraine from the degeneric western democratic world
Praying for Peace!Godbless Ukraine🙏
The people in Russia are not  behind this invasion
My whole youtube home page is about Russia Ukraine conflict
Poor western puppy >>>>>> Ukraine
Russia has all the rights to invade Ukraine.
This shows how coward and opportunistic UK and US are.
Our species needs to be eradicated, look at what we did to other hominids and what we're doing to the planet right now
That what got him killed
 @Robert Johnson  Our species does not need to be eradicated, don't know abour you but I want my loved ones to keep living on.
 @Robert Johnson  Spoken like a true Agent Smith. Maybe you could join the machines?
Fu*k Mankind 🤡🤡☠️💀💀
Yasallam 🗿
This Putain is disgusting.
And so the war has begun. Good luck to Ukraine 🇺🇦 From the safety of Britain 🇬🇧
NATO is the bunch of cowards led by Biden.
Snarling unbelievable
The war, that’s the most stupid thing that human can do . Whatever you can gain from killing people, negotiate, never attack and never kill people in the sake of profit.
US UK behind all this.
❤️🇺🇦💕🇺🇦💕🇺🇦❤️
What a violence activities,feel sorry for life's of innocent children and families Elderlies, that is a criminal billionears politics and Leaders who involved in this violence unloved actions that is very dangerous,I can see is all about power,and the oil must the other side,very dangrrous Politics demograt wicked are the killer deal
This is self defence, Isreali style...
Shit ALWAYS happens in europe .. ww1 ww2 and now ww3
I'm so sad for Ukraine, we in Croatia know very well what war is, and I wouldn't wish it to anyone. I really hope that Russia will end this🙁🙁
I was here.
F Puto Putin
PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE 🇺🇦 , WHO IS A FORMER CLOWN 🤡 , FRIENDSHIP WITH PRESIDENT TURKEY 🇹🇷,GOING TO DESTROY UKRAINE 🇺🇦
I can’t believe this is really happening; Bless all the people in danger.
Ukraine is fucked
Take out all their gas and oil production, military bases and make them feel the squeeze and finally assassinate Putin...
The Nazi government of Ukraine, backed by the United States, carried out a coup in 2014 and seized power in Ukraine.  They ban the Russian language and have been bombing civilians in Donetsk and Lugansk for 8 years now, where the majority of the Russian-speaking population lives.  Our president has been waiting for 8 years for them to decide peacefully and agree that Ukraine remains a single state.  But the Nazi government of Ukraine does not need Russian-speaking people in this territory.  Civilians will not be harmed.  This is a peace enforcement operation and liberation from the fascist government of Ukraine.
It will only end when Mr Putin has every country in Eastern Europe back to how it was before the Berlin Wall came down... A communist regime ruled with an iron fist... If he takes The Ukraine, more than likely, he will want Lithuania as well as Latvia....
 @Nigel Bevan  yes, unfortunately I'm very worried about the future of Europe.
 @Ana  No disrespects to you, but I'm too old to be worried... It's the younger generation that I feel sorry for... In my opinion, I think it's looking pretty grim..... I find it rather scary though that countries who are allies to Russia are keeping quiet.... In other words China and North Korea...
God not god
 @janii mutugi  god* idiot,your god is nothing but 1 of hundreds,cultist
https://youtu.be/2lUGNcwQo8I
“Save the people in danger??” lol why did “god” let any of this happen in general?! Lol not all so powerful if he can’t even stop a human from starting a war…
God can’t save you. Religion and war have no place here.

God is not real
Biden warned this
 @Bryan  I do agree with you on this, but people will feel me comforted with the use of it in the comment. No hard feelings.
Do You Felt the same For The People From Irak And Afghanistan!???????
 @Vision Studios  I love how people always bring this up. Listen, people are still people. They will make decisions such as starting wars or daily murders even. The world is coming to an end… very soon. Since the beginning, when Eve decided to eat the forbidden fruit, evil entered this earth. So ever since then there has been crime, hatred, and sin. God isn’t gonna make everyone stop fighting. How would people come to Him that way anyway? People would get so used to their perfect life style. What we need to do is get right with God because when your name is called, will you be ready my friend?
What don't you understand?rUkraine got bad politicians! They want to annex Ukraine to Europe and NATO to the army !!rNobody asks anything ... it's important that politicians fill their pockets with money !!rThe people have brainwashed the roses to smell more beautiful in Europe ..rUkranie politicians provoked war! Because the rule is known that Ukraine cannot be a NATO country !! By the way, World War 3 starts ... And what ?? should that happen ???rUkraine should now capitulate ... and civilians should be saved ... and politicians should be hanged because they provoked the war !!
 @Vision Studios  1 John 5:19 - The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one. Revelation 16:13-16 tells us that the kings of the earth (or world leaders) are listening to expressions inspired by demons. And that God is allowing it so everyone will be gathered to the war of the great day of God the Almighty. So this is all leading to Armageddon.In Ephesians 6:10-13 God is telling those who trust him to put on a complete spiritual suit of armor. Why? So that we can stand firm against the crafty acts of the Devil; because the struggle is really against the world rulers of this darkness, against the wicked spirit forces in heavenly places.Jesus Christ gave those who want to follow him signs to show that his return is imminent. Matthew chapter 24 / Mark chapter 13 / and Luke chapter 21. Jesus likened this time to the days of Noah. While he was building the ark Noah was preaching about God’s coming destruction of the wicked, but no one took him seriously. They just carried on with life as `normal’ until the day Noah and his family entered the ark, and God’s judgment came and they were all swept away - Matthew 24:36-39. If we want Jesus to save us when he returns we need to take the Bibles message seriously, and stay out of Satans politics and wars. Or as our Lord says in John 17:16 about his followers “They are no part of the world, just as I am no part of the world.” 😊🙏🏿🙏🙏🏽🙏🏾
you seen nothing yet the russians want the land they will destroy ukraine and force them out of the country prepare for at millions of refugees  like 10`s
“Bless” Only the Ukrainians*
It's a war
This is how Palestinians feel every day and have been for decades, America is funding and supporting Isreal while they do the same thing to Palestinians.
I could be wrong but I saw an apartment complex look torn up by a bomb. Pretty scary how theyre supposedly only going for military cites.
 @Thalassaer  no, God is the only God
 @Bob Vance Vance Refrigeration  if everyone didn’t believe in God the want to kill would be deadly 💀
You can't belive Russia is actually invading a country on the whims of the will of putin. Can you belive water is wet?
 @Vision Studios  God showed us what’s right and wrong, don’t blame God for something that we’ve done 😕
TEF it's happening believe it. We have had enough with the western hypocrisy,feminist,gays men fakin men from behind, women abusing the power that men gave them.feminism,BLM. Now watch what man Putin does to you
Get them Russia !
Ya
But why is it happening
 @Vision Studios  God Is supposed to be asleep depends what u belive in were in this world on our own noone can save us
 @Bryan  ikr but telling the  brainwashers that lol
this happened for a reason you have no right to bring God or anything that has religion into this who raised you??? 💀💀
 @Turtlemilk -  ew. russia can loose 🤍🤍
 @sled necks  exactly! God wants us to come to him on our own, he chose not to force everyone but instead gave us the free will to choose how we live. None of us deserve to just be given the perfect life, we have to earn it.
Guys let’s not discuss our religious opinions, here and just feel for those in danger and who are losing loved ones.
 @Gilbert  you dummy, the people of Afghanistan don't want the Taliban, they want USA protection
 @Vision Studios  maybe he likes war
 @Anonymous Jazzper  god does not exist in reality, it only exists in the imagination of fools
 @Vision Studios  Its called free will, it's been prophesied that war will happen so change or burn for eternity.
Common bully Putin, give some nuke to that Ukraine, if you think you're powerful.
 @Thalassaer  While that is true, that’s a horrible argument. There’s only 1 god that could logically exist, which is the god of the Bible.
You are right not to believe it .. it's pure bullshit
This been happening for 20 years in middle east...what's new here.?
Fear is illegal >:(
 @Abbey Roberts  I didn't ask for your opinion female
NATO put those people in danger. By insisting that Ukraine should join NATO.
First we're trying to desperately save lives from Covid, and reduce hospitalization. Then we're intentionally causing pain and suffering, increasing hospitalization. Both completely different reasons of course, but in the end it comes down to peoples lives. Where is humanity. This is sickening. This world is awfully corrupt.
Yall wicked news people!!!! Nato need to go sit they dirty ass down!!!!
Send Hillary their she knows a lot about Russia.😉🙂
Between the big powers UKRAINE is the choosen battlefield
Isn't removing Nazis a good thing?  Or no?  Curious.
UK must be crying now that their military base in Ukraine got blown up
The BBC , its funny that they cover something 1000s of miles away , yet couldn't cover protesting people outside their own building ,
Why don't the aliens remove this evil man from power
WW3!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
While we cannot learn from my past and the mistake and make a new world and learn how to not repeat the same mistakes again
The most usless thing in the world         👉#UN
Putin: I’m not targeting civilians, meanwhile blowing up an airport and an apartment smh
The Ukrainian president who must now fear for his job 😂
BBC sucks
3:02 The good reason why Putin had to march in...
dont forget croatia won the homeland wor against the 3rd biggest army in the world at that time so ukraine has some chanses
Ukraine did a big mistake signing agreement with Russia and handed over the nukes. Budapest agreement. Our PM Lal Bhadur Shastri died in Russia. Mr Putin Lied to the world. He is not having any plan to attack. He lied
Just dont join nato! Why threaten someone far stronger than you. Think of your people not your pride! Forget the west they wont help
Those evil Putin eyes.. it shows a lot grrrr..
Stop spamming
 @spork  You will like this!https://youtu.be/7HAYdP13wgg🤣🤣🤣
This is not an invasion, but the disarmament of the criminal, fascist army of Ukraine, the Russian military does not touch civilians! Ukrainian criminals have been killing residents of Donbass for eight years...
they're doing exactly that. they're bombing innocent families. children are hurt and will be hurt in these bombings. innocent men and women will be lost to these missiles.
 @Viktor Svetlov  I've heard the word fascist thrown around so much it has lost all meaning. I'm looking at a sovereign nation being invaded and innocent people suffering. I dont think you know who the fascist is. Look up the definition to fascist dumbass
Ukraine threatened, Russia defended itself
God bless Russia
I am Russian, and i feel so sorry. Pleas, stop this. We don't want war.
Civilians yet again caught up between egoes, interests and madness of military complexes... so unfortunate
I will put a family up in my house. God bless
We humbly request Ukraine not to strike Russia becoz Russia is more strong than Ukraine. People will lose lives and property damage.
Those jets are Russian sukhoi's
THANKS TO WAR BBC IS GETTING BACK SOME VIEWERSHIP I STILL WONT WATCH THEIR BS THO
They had months of warning of this, and they didn't prepare :/
You are talking about the Ukrain and how it is terror, but in 1999. in Yugoslavia is been terror by NATO and 3500 civilians is killed. And for NATO this is not a terror. Then what is it?
The day you sheep realise your western leaders are simply gangsters in suits with the agenda to have full control and influence over this entire world, INC Russia, you'll understand who the bad guys are. The west has been extremely antagonistic towards Russia. Outin is no Saint, but tell me why would the west position their military so close to Russian borders despite Russia being open with how uncomfortable they were with this given the frosty history of the Cold War?The sanctions took the cake and I don't see the Russian peolle backing down so here we go into World War Three. I'm moving the hell out of the UK. This is not going to end well as you silly sheep seem to forget there's a depopulation agenda also
The west lured the Ukrainians and now let them down
Allah akbar, may Allah bless us all and protect Ukraine
Fuck Ukraine 🇺🇦 🖕🏿 and by the way stop spreading lie BBC , Russia is just demilitarizing Ukraine , they’re not killing Civilians.
Prayers 🙏to everyone affected 💔
Fuck you Putin and all idiots that believe a war can be a good thing !
My prayers go out to Ukrainians.
Between? One crazy russian doing what he wants, others just defending what is their own. Its not about egos on other side...
Putin is clever. He knows what may happen if ukraine joins NATO.
русский народ заплатит цену за то, что делает Путин, ему все равно. Путин накопил большое состояние. Его время скоро закончится
if Ukraine still had all the nuclear weapons it didn't give to russia they probably wouldnt even dare dry something like this. the deal was the russia would come to Ukraines aid if it were attacked so russia should really be be attacking its self stupid as that sounds.
Who would believe a liar like him!!! It's absolutely clear he had in the works for years!! The oil and gas deal with China needed to be in place before the invasion. He plans on a long drawn out battle he needs China's money to finance the war machine.
just people being people....... right?        :(
If NATO fails to protect Ukraine this time around, it should be dissolved.
lets surround Russia with military bases, ffs what did you expect? Our leaders would do the same evil shite.

All NORTH ATLANTIC TERRORIST ORGANIZATION had to do is stay the fuck away from Russian border. Is that hard to do? This wouldn't have happened.
PEACE is not just a word its is NEED for HUMANITY.
Why BBC doesn't show Chernobil in the map???What is going on in Chernobil???How many bio weapons labs are in Ukraine?
The warmongering Russian dictator is totally out of his mind. The world should respond quickly with severe sanctions, all possible ways of retaliations, and continuous strong military supplies to Ukraine. If Putin wants to drag Russia to a deep bog of war, let's totally submerge it!
Ucraine❤️😌
Why choose war if peace is possible? Think about the innocent people , young ones and elderly and those who are poor. Those who started these nonsense are evil,No heart . Stupid , the minds behind these tragic event you are the one who must suffer, not the civilians.
They forced him to attack
Boris is more concerned about the fuel price going up. Youtube that statement
আত্মহত্যা যদি মহাপাপ না হতো?  তাহলে কি হতো কেউ যদি যেনে থাকেন তাহলে আমাকে  কমেন্ট করে সাহায্য করুন
God  mercy on us.
There is no 'war' - it's a conquest. The Ukrainians have been abandoned and set up to fail. Why? So the west can say : 
The Nazi government of Ukraine, backed by the United States, carried out a coup in 2014 and seized power in Ukraine.  They ban the Russian language and have been bombing civilians in Donetsk and Lugansk for 8 years now, where the majority of the Russian-speaking population lives.  Our president has been waiting for 8 years for them to decide peacefully and agree that Ukraine remains a single state.  But the Nazi government of Ukraine does not need Russian-speaking people in this territory.  Civilians will not be harmed.  This is a peace enforcement operation and liberation from the fascist government of Ukraine.
 @renat  oh really? Is that why civilians are dying?
Because people are waste of energy , We’re better then this •
 @Official Angrygoldstar  Your wrong, people dont have God.
People need GOD. Or we head to devastation prophesied in Bible. It will happen anyways as mentioned but people need to go to the throne of GOD. Humble themselves and ask GOD to Imtervene
Last week Ukrainians laughed and doubted US intelligence...
It it pronounced keev or key- ev ??
Western hypocrisy has no end : remember Iraq, Lybia, Syria ? Of course, they were only Arabs, right? Remember the CIA-led putsch against a democratically-pro Russian elected government? All you had to do was not to mess with the Russian bear. Russia is in its right and did the right thing to ensure its security. NATO is a tool of aggression and war and should be dismantled just like the Warsaw pact was. That would be the beginning of a lasting peace.
Just like Canada are evil regime bent on control of everything. We like Russians just not leaders we like US just not its leaders. Its a pattern we should ALL help stop
UKRAINE SHOULD SURRENDER TO SAVE PEOPLE
Why does this surprise anyone?  The west pushed russia into this.  Now we can sell weapons to Ukraine...it worked.
i just hope as much as possible people die so there will be a lesson for all the remaining people to know how awful and painfull war is, looks like ww1 and ww2 wasn't enough, i hope ww3 will be like Einstein said. Enough pain to ceasefire for many generations! P.s doesn't matter who you are, how you look, rich or poor, white or mexican, I love everyone! if we die tomorrow remember it was just a bad dream, our generations will solve all isues and live peacefuly, that is the number 1 reason we live today!
This is the start of ww3.
Hmmm
Lol if this was Eren telling putin to destroy the whole countries I would be laughing out hard😂😂😂
Russians will never change.
All in self defense...Isn't that what Hitler said about Poland? Wishing everyone over there to all the best, be safe as you can be. (Not so good with the words)
Seems VERY SURGICAL.
God have mercy on Ukraine for the sake of the righteous ones even if is only one person. Protect her against her enemies to show your might as the most sovereign God of all time. Holy are you the King of glory may your name be praise forever more. Ukraine will be safe, Amen.
Putin knows the u.s is able to arm them anytime  they  are lying to the American people fake election killing citizens political prisoners fuck you blame him...
With every civilian death 10 freedom fighters are created...
NATO should move into Moscow now...
30 years the US has asked to join NATO the US said know the chance for peace was missed years ago. 14000 people have died nothing was being done by the west only putting weapons being given to Ukraine. Don’t listen to the hype especially from the west. Democracy’s a load of bullshit,  we’re did the scamdenic go?
Is the Ukrainian military fighting back?
Destabilization of nations starts with the destabilization of the press.
Stay stong Ukraine, wish you luck from Croatia
I don’t even know what to say. For all the people of Ukraine keeping you in prayers. That’s all I can do. 🙏🙏🙏
The US has thousand of sophisticated drones, that can each launch dozens of heat seeking missiles that can detect and take out tanks. We should use them.
Stand with Ukraine 🇺🇦🇮🇳
Aye skee skee cant wait to die in another country next year
Civilians need to rise to arms and help fight back. If they want to keep their country.
world war 3 is begun
Russia should send one missile to BBC headquarters may they'll start reporting the Truth.
Zelenský je úbohá bábka slúžiaca americkým záujmom. Oni vedia ako na to!!!!!
When US and EU support terrorist group #TPLF in EthiopiaTigray  to bombard my city my hometown in Nobody cares... Now finally my dream come true... Dear US Supporters  Enjoy the war.I already enjoyed it for more than a year. Viva Russia!! 😁😁😁😁
Putin lied to us
The moral of this video is NOT TO BE RACIST. The same almost happened in the USA , where Trump almost desintegrated the USA.
ARENT YOU TIRED OF PANDEMIC AND YOU STILL HAVE TIME FOR WAR MY GOD PLEASE SAVE ALL HUMANS.
Putin is a liar, Russia are turning into the Nazi Party

What is this about, this cannot be good for anyone.
In nowdays this is unbelievble. God bless Ukraine. Stop Russia.
Go... Go... Russia!
You seem like a very lovely person...
USA and allies liberated Libya Iraq syria killed thousands of civilians and nobody said a prayer.people are praying  for Ukraine that's a good start.
Both America and russia are the major threats to this world
They are taking random shots, your hit in your space, just like that.
GOD bless Russian
Free Ukraine
this is propaganda all targets hit by russian forces have been military ones. where was the BBC when the donbass had been shelled for 8 years from 2014 to 2022. where was the news coverage for those suffering under ukrainian shelling. where was the UN, where was NATO condemning ukrainian forces attacking civilian targets in the donbass. the west are fully of hypocrits. ukrainian citizens have nothing to fear from russian forces.
Russia should be ashamed to even say that they feel threaten by the new Ukraine!!! And I thought Russia was a power house but all they are is a bully!!!
I hope they can figure this out and disable this war. I hope this won't end as another bad history and getting Ukraine whipped out. This must be horrific and alarming that the home they used to happy live in isn't safe anymore for the civilians and poor animals that has nothing to do with this war. I feel the horrible fear from the bombing and siren alarms even across from my screen. please be safe, god will receive your prayers 🙏🙏
Hope we don’t have to get ready for another world war
Are they not fighting back?
“This is all in self defense” -Putin
KGB criminals are not supposed to be allowed to the politics. Russia's mistake number one.
According to the western mainstream media only West has a right to start and wage wars. How many countries you have violated their sovereignty, bombarded them and destroyed them
Ukraine president was a pussy and passive the last couple weeks all of a sudden he gets attacked and now pleads to the west lmao what a joke should’ve had a hard stance from the get go
Why don't all the citizens fight for their country? Everyone grab a freaking machine guns and stand together.One Ant can not beat a beetle, but one million ants can kill a beetle. STAND TOGETHER AND FIGHT FOR YOUR COUNTRY, UKRAINE!!!!!!!
Shoot back.
Pessoas egoistas
Yes and NATO say that they are institution for defense purposes only but still they bomb Serbia ‘99 so dont say anything about Putin pls……
Look what an impotent pig can do. ...
Vladimir Pozner: How the United States Created Vladimir Putin >>> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8X7Ng75e5gQ
So, Ukraine, how's that American protection going for you?
Putin why?
It's going to end quickly just like Palestine issues last year it's all a showBombs all over but the press is there lol
They only showed the public interviews which are against the war. But in reality 20% don't care, 30% are against and 50% are pro Putin in Moscow.
THIS WAR IS FOR WHAT??????
Hail Russia fuck America 🖕🏼
the worst part is that Russians and Ukrainians have the same blood
Sounds like Shakasvili of Georgia
Listening to lies is harder than talking. Всё будет хорошо)
And nobody can do shit about it. Scary times.
Bruh
its too early to say but this could be the greatest miscalculation ever made, so far demonstrations against this NEO NAZI THUG IN 24 CITIES IN RUSSIA ALREADY.
My heart goes out to the Ukrainian peopleJust think of all the children whose lives are in total turmoil now there  future is completely bleak and uncertainCongratulations Biden voters
Fortunate son slowly starts to play in the background
Honestly, just give him Ukraine, if he so desperately needs it. I know this doesn‘t sound very good, but hear me out. It‘s citizens will mostly be able to migrate to other countries of Europe, where they will be welcomed with open arms. If Putin really only wants Ukraine, and if we don‘t intervene, he will stop after he gets what he wants. We will have prevented WW3 and saved millions of lives, if not the world. Sometimes it‘s, sadly but truly, the best option to give a „little“ sacrifice, to prevent a much, much bigger one.
I don't see any 
NATO and America too much talk but no action.
How backwards thinking do you have to be to come up with these excuses / statements.Prayers go out to all of Ukraine
I'm all for punching Putin in the mouth. Gas prices and nuclear war be damned.We can only die once.Let's make our lives count.
Oh my goodness lord please no more WWIII
The Nazi government of Ukraine, backed by the United States, carried out a coup in 2014 and seized power in Ukraine.  They ban the Russian language and have been bombing civilians in Donetsk and Lugansk for 8 years now, where the majority of the Russian-speaking population lives.

Cringe
It's what all the Democrats want. They'll get it if this doesn't stop.
Putin = Stalin
zelenskyy is deceived by west
Now communists wont utter a single word..
Mad max or metro?? How will the post apocalyptic world be like after wwiii??
PLEASE STOP The WAR RUSSIA!!!!!!
Russian have to pay the price for what they've done.
The president of Ukraine is not fearing for his job, he’s fearing for his life.
Such an awful acts!
Our prayers should always stand side by side with you against oppression. 🇹🇷🇺🇦❤️
Fuck Russia
Everyone's heart is going out to neo-nazis.
najlepsze jest to że pojazdy wojskowe pamiętają zimną wojne, ci idioci nawet BWP nie potrafili zmodernizować
Xd I'm smiling it reminds me of texas people getting dead smh a bunch of dead weight toys😂😂😂
Putin is bound to withdraw now that the UK  house's of Parliament have been lit up in Ukrainian colours.
ALLAH is the Greatest Of ALL
fuck russia
They should have had this handled a long time ago I don't understand why governments wait tell lives are lost to react such a shame my condolences to the familys that lost loved ones
Only Putin want this. No sane human wants war juat Elites and the millitary industrial complex to make money. Greed again!
Nobody gives a damn if an americans wage war &  rob the afghan people's money but I hear screams when russia attacks ukraine. Nice job hypocrates.
What happen to the Russia peace keepers ?
bad leader, should worry about its people, instead of thinking about his job OR his own life
 @2strokeboy  He is worrying about his people though. If he didn't care he would've fled already like the aweful Afghan President, but instead he's staying put and preparing his public for fighting even after the army inevitably lose. I reckon he's gonna stay till the end
 @dorgesh  good
 @dorgesh  Watch leave ukraine with a government in exile
Yeah right we saw how much turkey cared about its friend Ukraine
Fireball after Russian missile hits airport in western Ukraine..... YOU SEE. THIS IS CLICK BAIDE. I WACHED VIDEO AND NO MENTION NOTHING FROM HEAD LINE ONE MORE PROOF THAT BBC IS FUL OF SHIT
None of yall said God Bless Iraq or Afghanistan.
Where did you get the thumbnail from
Os Estados Unidos estão desmoralizados!Ninguém respeitas mais os EUA
Putin is a legend
NATO the war mongering organisation
bomb the kremlin..simple..ridiots.. you said it wouldnt happen..usa, the west and nato are  worthless..rweve been warning  yall for 20 years now

Though I'm not a fan of Putin , for the Ukrainian President to call his country a democracy is a strech.
I hope you people also criticised the US  and UK for their evil war crimes in the Middle East. Russia should not be invading a sovereign country but “the west” is no better and has no moral high ground…
I think we are witnessing one of the most significant moments in our present history
We need to kill  communism to the root
Ukrain has right to save their country,. Join in NATO
Well well well, looks like historians will have fun in the next 5 years
Everyone watching please be informed that all these are fake news propaganda. Not a single civilian has been hurt in this glorious fight against nazism that was ordered by president Putin.

West world, wake up. By now it's clear - it's a well planned multiple stages operation russia and china started 2 years ago with Covid to put Western economies on knees. Now Ukraine. Watch - Taiwan is next. US gets in to protect Taiwan. NATO kicks in... and we have a global collapse of economies and total mess
Thanks NATO for expanding when you said you wouldn’t
First lick US shoe like a dog now he is licking everyones shoe

Get a seal team and take out putin
Putin is a spoilt child. He took all he could get and now finally after Mummy said no he's rolling on the floor at the supermarket in full tantrum mode. Time to send him to the naughty step.
I believ i could kiev
So 2014-2020 was just a dry run helping the separatists and then plan for this full scale invasion.
Russian economy will be venezuela within weeks
commercials on Videos like these... i m  throwing up YouTube!

PEACE AND LOVE TO THE WHOLE WORLD!
😔😔😔🇵🇰
Bogus broadcasting corporation
What a liar.
The EU backed nazi groups in their coup against the government back in 2014. These groups then targeted Russian speaking minority groups in Ukraine. Cutting their water supply and electricity supply. Putin has the right to defend them.
WW3
Nigeria should try and support Ukraine
BRING DOWN THE WESTERN WORLD!  TIME FOR CHANGE

So the live footage is fake news, fox news praises putin he is a thug and dictator. Next will be Poland and any other little country he wants to take over. The people that are being interviewed are paid actors,  Russian citizens being thrown in jail for holding a peaceful protest they don't want war.  So let them continue to live as they have for years Ukraine is not going to try and take over Russia. Putin picks on the little guy, he woukdntnpick on the United States or China if it bordered Russia, no the little poor people who are helpless.

 @Kendra  I get my history from various sources. Russian's get their media from state owned TV yet you accuse me of not listening to the correct media. The reason that the Soviet Union split apart was simply because communism doesn't work. People were sick of being part of a failed state. The Soviet Union allowed Ukraine in the 50s to have it's own independence but under the umbrella of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union no longer exists and so it's logical that it would break away. You have a bad history of looking after your own people and backing leaders thar cause misery to their own people. Look at Romania to name one and now Belarus with a shocking leader stamping on his own people. We don't want war but you need to sort out your house and get rid of your dictator Putin.

Probably the most hated man on Earth currently. Even by his own people. He has completely lost his marbles. Should be eliminated. Even his own cabinet only supports him because they fear for their own lives.
Just saying but if nato want to hold off Russia, Hurry the hell up and get in there. Once Russia incinerates Ukraines airports, train stations and major roads, Ukraine is lost. You cant get supplies in and you also can’t get your fighter aircraft in. It becomes significantly harder to retake Ukraine by that point.
Why is it every time the children in power decide to have a fight ITS OUR LIVES THEY USE FOR IT. NOT THEIR LIVES
This is awful!!! 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Are they shooting missiles at Russia as well?
This is just an awful worldAnd it’s certain people that make it worse
Putin knows the Biden administration is weak and incompetent.
God bless the men who decide to stay behind and defend their mother land.
Ah shit,here we go again
An another American blunder and  NATO
Where is nato ????
Unverified.... Remember America did this on 911 to start a war
lol American media like the Washington Post are only talking about how the country being invaded could affect the mid term elections……… ok, a country has just been INVADED and the Washington Post is more concerned with elections……. People have died today and are fleeing, but the Washington Post is worried about. Elections.
$5 on Russia
This is what you get when you try to join nato and be a puppet and have missiles facing towards mother Russia, go mr Putin blast these puppets
Why the innocent people have to suffer from the warminds of the leaders very selfish very unhuman..god save the people of ukraine and russia..heal the world..make the leaders be patient..talk..communicate..and love.
Even if russia tkes ukraine , the EU is still at its boarder thus there will Never Be Security in russias Eyes, its just an excuse to start war
Putin is now the hunted. Stay strong Ukraine.
Russia has become biting dog

 @Kendra  I dunno if u understand what I meant. I was trying to say If NATO wants to have a chance to retake Ukraine, now is their chance. Since Russian aircraft are comparatively worse than nato aircraft, fight them while you can. Also, I don’t care about Ukraine. Nor do I care if they become part of Russia one day. Civilians are the only ones who will suffer and they are the ones who should be cared about.
 @Kendra  I’m also not supporting NATO here. Their entire history is literally taking land from people. I'm also in no situation to say if Russia is right or not. I haven’t researched their history.

 @Kendra  trust me I understand what you're saying. Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons in the Budapest treaty during the Reagan years. Democracy is being protected from tyranny. Putin wants to drive out nato and Democracy all together because he doesn't want it to spread into Russia. I read my history and have lived through most of it. As far as Afganistan is concerned the military gave up their country to the Talliban.
Hoooo it's going on well and my friend wanted me to and visit 🇿🇲🇿🇲 however I pray for pice be with you.
Ukraine should Just give up like the Afghanistan army did! Peaceful take over and no one gets hurt! Civilian are only going to die because of war madness
Euro is a joke. After locking down its people for 2 years  .Who is writing this script  and where is Covid when you need it ..
The US is so friken dumb.  They have record debt and now they are going to face inflation and a war over a shit hole country that offers no long term benefits.   Instead, the US will lose development momentum and other countries will continue to close the gap on US tech innovation.  Russia doesn’t care about the Ukraine, but war there will slow the US down more than it will slow Russia and China down. F the USA.
Denazification... The Ukrainian Prime Minister is Jewish!
Viva Putin
I have an idea:For the entirety of this campaign, let’s not refer to it as “At War with Russia!”. Let’s call it what it is, we’re at war with Vladimir Putin.
Fcuk the western NWO puppet governments Russian and Putin are actually fighting for all our freedoms from a one world government. Ask Clause Straub. NATO IS YOUR ENEMY NOT YOUR FRIEND.
Real refugees, on like that other dirt we get on boats
How many people think US hand in this crisis?
There's no pergatory for war criminals.
Vladimir Putin.....you are now considered a terrorist. A threat to global peace. Damn you warmonger.
Putin is ambitious and defiant like a wolf. I hope UN and Od help Ukraine.
Oh my God 😱 these poor people :(I hope they get somewhere safely and manage to get out place in time :(
Putin is evil, evil, evil.
Putin and Russia are EVIL. Putin has clearly lost his mind. There is NOTHING too bad for them for doing this.
Why would Russia signed peace treaty is David is still in Vegas that makes no sense Why would they do that
Putin is right. Viva Russia!!
Now Russia is kicking azz again, the west is peeing their pants!😂🤣😅😉

 @Kendra  If you want the same borders as in the past, go live in a cave and hunt wild animals with a sharp stick. Russia is attacking an independent country and there is nothing more to it.

Go to war
Prayers for civilians hurt in this conflict. 🙏
Rip to all those who lost their lives and thank you for the people fighting for are countries safety please end this war we shouldn't have to live in a world with weapons and violence please consider all the innocent people in the world who haven't caused any trouble the children who won't have a future the emotional scaring and the PTSD left behind on people who were going about their time I'm greatful for this country but please do the right thing end the war and talk how adults should you are both powerful leader of countries who can do great damaged to the society
when israel, turkey and the united states bomb the syrian army that fights against terrorists nobody said anything but now that russia bombs military bases in ukraine everyone gets angry and annoyed, damn weak brains
Viva Russia
Vous tous European ne touche pas d,envoyer Les troupe en UCLAINE pour arreter la ww3
we as a world should invade russia.
Has Ukraine formed an international brigade yet?
Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty provides that the parties agree that an armed attack on one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack on all of them. The question, however, is how quickly the response will be if one or more of the member states is suddenly attacked by Russia at the behest of Putin. Should all NATO member states meet first to discuss the measures to be taken? Although we are not (yet) at war with Russia, we must bear in mind that the despot Putin is insane and capable of anything. If one or more of the member states were to be attacked by Russia on Putin's orders, it would have to be immediately met with a counter-attack, without losing a split second. A Third World War is then inevitable, as is the end of the world! Another question is whether Europe and the United States are NOW on high alert. Putin has already indicated that he has a whole arsenal of nuclear weapons with which he can split the entire globe in half 50 times! Once again we have seen that the despot Putin and his henchmen in the Kremlin are capable of anything. They do not shy away from killing children, women and the elderly. We must stay awake and alert!
Next China will invade Taiwan.
You can never believe what you see or hear on any of these news outlets.
Looks like small isolated fires to me
Putin just lost all credibility. Once a man breaks his word...he is no longer a man. Putin said that invasion is 
War is definitely terrible, but Ukraine isn't a victim here. This country began making unappropreate decisions long before. This scandal must have been ended long ago in 2014, but not now and not like that. Nobody's right.But Ukraine people don't deserve it. DPR and LPR citizens didn't deserve violence as eell. Nobody deserves this shit. It is so terrible to know how they suffer from fierce fights. Prayers for all families that involved in that
hahahahahahaa
This man says he believes in his army but I don't see any fighting back ,they even let the tanks in through borders without any restrictions..!!!..WTF..!!
Lol only Israel gets the missle defense system I forget it’s name
Ukraine 1st poland 2nd .. then rest of the world.... USSR is back
Russia is being a bully
Simple solution: accept Russia needs secure borders without NATO/US military on the other side.  A mutually guaranteed neutral Ukraine.
 @the other Andrew  Indeed thats the only solution
 @the other Andrew  I agree I don't agree with the war I've never felt so scared in my life I want to live just because the world value money and land more over the population of the country and the people in it it's sad 😔😔
Iraq,Afghanistan,Libya,Serbia...so many times America has done the same.rWhy the world has not attacked America so far
 @beast98 demon  because we’re not be-heading people for liking the color yellow. I don’t agree with any politics but nobody’s gonna stand by a country that doesn’t let women drive Get over yourself a
Russia is conducting an anti-terrorist operation against a fascist oligarchic regime installed from the West in Kyiv.
The russian bear fighting against mice. Who has the balls to bring fear back to Russia? Russia should fight against other bears, not mice. What a shame Russia does.
And to you at BBC   CNN YOU ARE A PIECE OF SHIT . WHAT HAVE YOU DONE UK ALL AROUND THE WORLD????? IN AFRICA ?? INDIA ??? F....YOU . YOU WILL PAY THE PRICE OF SELLING FAKE NEWS
Jack A wants a world war
Work of the devil in person high in Russia.
No one should go to war with a whole country full of people who really don't want it. These people are silenced by Putin and the rest of the Kremlin, we have to hope that citizens of Russia will stand up and say 
This is your bad job ..BBC ...and many other ..Find truth and No lies
Absolutely this is going to start a World War. You know something else I don't understand is the putting on the news for everybody to see the whole world including Russia and Putin where everybody is going which is underground that doesn't seem very safe to me now some things should be left unsaid
God’s bless people in Ukrainian god’s help people Ukrainian
Wtf is wrong with Putin?!
this is what happens when you have a demented president in the United States. a Woke president that needs to read cards to speak.  Putin saw the best chance to invade Ukraine.  In two weeks China will invade Taiwan.  All due to the election of biden, who was basically 
Russia has already started a full-scale war and the EU/USA are delaying responding just so the world can see first that Russia is the AGGRRESOR, once we are confident everyone understands this We can and Need to Respond
Stay strong ukraine . 🇦🇿.

I agree with the gentleman who believes that if Putin is not stopped with force now, he will not stop at Ukriane.....and indeed it may be the beginning of WW3.
Can't the world come together and fight this monster called Putin?
Russia wetever your killing people  an innocent. lam worming Africa's contreis never that. Russia together with chine are bad cotries killers even
Eu acho que se eles estão respondendo assim é porque tentaram de vários jeitos entrar num acordo. E viram que os americanos estavam pressionando- os. As vezes parece que é combinado essa guerra declarada. Parece as favela aqui no Brasil os policiais atirando e as pessoas passando nas ruas.
How DARE Putin do this...
Evil
STOP WAR!
That why I love russian but war is not  good for civil population. 🇵🇰
This Hitler wannabe is trying to start another world war.Very apparent who he sold his soul to....Dispicable piece of trash; not only will innocent Ukrainians die unjustly, but so will everyone else that has to participate in this mentally ill sociopath's illusions of grandeur.May GOD help us all.🙏
I wish same like Ukraine, BBC would report the hardships and miseries suffered by Afghanis and Iraqis during US and NATO attacks,
That guy says I don’t think Russia will occupy their capital. He doesn’t know his neighbours well.
3 Rd world war started
President of Russia he is satener he is killing people an ennocet  he is very fullish
🇺🇦 🇺🇸
British Bullshit Corporation....!!
It is better to lose small than lose it all, zelensky is a bad poka player.
Wtf. Is this.  Russia is doing same. As. U.s.a. Did with many countries  nd putin saying ukrain is not develop fkkk.  Wt about russia. Russian have many unemployed people there.
Putin did this out of self defense???He is a horrible man and China is right there holding his hand. This is coming to America eventually believe that. It’s only a matter of time. Sending prayers for healing ❤️‍🩹 and strength!  America is to scared to stand up to these guys. We’ve been lied to. Forced schooling and religion More Propaganda than the North Koreans have ever seen! We have never been free just on a long leash…
Putin= Trash
Crying with airpods in your ears lol.
Ukrain and Europe have to kick out the assigning neocons and there who ideology.
Seems to me Hitler and Putin have something in common. something to think about. Who's next Poland
Lol Ukraine president start talking shit, i thought he's brave, He did not think about the lives of his soldiers, the conditions of Russia were simple. Don't join NATO
Sometimes people forget that human’s have to die one day no matter what! And after that it’s hell or heaven depends on you the things you have done to this universe, god is always watching us, god will not forgive the bad people. PEACE! 🙏
Putin Putin stop fighting  no more fighting
How about the Country attacks by Western Power and America..They killed innocent people but no one stand..
BBC is fake news , designed as western propaganda machine. why BBC supports one side as a media company?
What a lie BBC is spreading Anti war protesters are gathering in Russia. My comments about this are being deleted! otherwise I would post the links, just search twitter!
Putin please stop this is not nice
Rather than watching your zombified news media coming out of the West, might I suggest visiting any of the 100's of live webcams that are located in the Ukraine? By doing so, you will see that nothing is happening except in the two sovereign republics that Russia has promised to help escape the neo-Nazi genocidal government in the Ukraine.Research Zelensky for five minutes by googling 
HEY UM..... I MAYBE NOT INVOLVED THIS BUT GET MANY SUPPLIES AND WEAPON EQUIPMENT I KNOW ITS HARD FOR US TO FIGHT THOSE RUSSIAN. WE NEED TO STAY STRONG AND ALIVE. I'MMA GAMING EXPERIENCE BUT WE NEED DEFENSE, SNIPER, MARKSMAN AND COMBAT FOR THE FUTURE. STAY SAFE Y'ALL ... I'LL PRAY FOR UR BEST. THIS IS RESISTANCE WE MUST STAND EACH OTHER...
How sad in this day and age to start a senseless war.  Have we not seen what happened in World War 1 and 2? And many others? My heart goes out to the innocent citizens of both countries 😢.  The world sees that it's the government war.🇨🇦💛💚🖤🇯🇲🇨🇦🇯🇲
This is for sure going to kick off WW3... I don't see how it won't tbh
You at BBC ARE NOT TELLING THE TRUHT OK..I live in Odessa and Russia is just protecting nog only Russia but a chaos in the region. Ukraine IS NOT A DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY its Europa and the USA  thats making the problem...Please People dont be fooled again like Iraq and libya and many wars before . Look at the history...
Russia goes into history on the same page as Hitler. Russia lied. Russia broke the promise given to Ukraine never to attack and invade! For this promise Ukraine gave 6000 nuclear weapons to Russia from Sowiet era. Now we see what a Russian promise is worth: NOTHING. So western countries will never trust a bit in Russia anymore ever. Let's build up huge stock piles of Nuclear Weapons. If Russia dares to invade other countries let's use them without a blink - we learn from Russia how evil they invade after lying and invading - NEVER we trust in Russia again!Russia is aggressive as Hitler was, Nazis are entering Ukraine from the north, east and south into Ukraine killing Ukrainians!
stay strong brothers 🇺🇦 🇬🇪 pu*in must be taken out
Where all the lgbtq ppp now ?
that's very heart-breaking!rshow some humanity Putin or else declare yourself as an animal!
May almighty Allah bring peace on earth
OMG i hate this man

Ukraine's president calling out the democratic world while imprisoning his competition: that's a bit rich, buddy.
My heart goes to all of Ukraine

Putinis a monster!  God bless the Ukraine!
Wtf are we doing are we just going to stand by and let these children men and women doing why are we not doing anything it’s shameful this is the exact same damn thing that happened in ww2 the world powers let Germany stick their thumb up their ass and what happened millions dead innocent and guilty in a matter of years we can’t let this happen we can’t just stand by and let them do what they want if we do let them do let them do what they want history is bound to repeat itself and why did we spend so much money on our military just to let the equipment rust and by the next best thing come on these people need us and all we do is sit on the sidelines and I can’t help but to feel so bloody useless it just sucks
And the Greatest most popular elect US president is still napping. Be safed ukraineEdit : Putin knows the west is weak with stupid leaders.This ain't will be like world war 2 folks, because we third world country are now independent and no longer under the British Empire . So best of luck and prayers
Hope more shit pops off so my unit can get deployed. Tired of Russia talking big game like they’re strong it’s about time someone shuts them up for good.
The Ukrainian leadership needs to allow citizens to own military-style firearms.
I hope no one suffers from this war, i hope russia and Ukraine make peace.
I never thought this would occur in my lifetime, my heart goes out to all of Ukraine.
A democratic war like Ukraine's president said
I trained as a British Soldier with the Black Watch R.H.R.  We trained to fight Russians... Now we will get a chance to end them and their Armies, once and for all
Its 2022! And if you didn't understand 2011 Libya by now, this news will never be accurate.
Nice RUSSIA:)
Yeah like everyone is 
Self defense? Yeah Ukraine was really surrounding Russia. That’s why Ukraine was the one with forces amassed on the border 😒 disgusting
This is an invasion on democracy, sovereignty, & freedom. Shame on NATO for allowing this to happen. People like putin are a danger to humanity
What putin is doing is disgusting. Disappointing.
well done to america for wanting ukraine into nato, placing nuclear weapons on russia's doorstep.. despite:The official result from the Autonomous Republic of Crimea was a 97 percent vote for integration of the region into the Russian Federation with an 83 percent voter turnout, and within the local government of Sevastopol there was also a 97 percent vote for integration of the region into the Russian Federation with an 89 ...2014 Crimean status referendum - Wikipediaamerica's economy is ruled by war. out of a debacle in the middle-east, into another f war, dragging everyone into its maddnessajust because they can print enough money to buy-up western media... f our souless culture
My heart goes out to the innocent people and soldiers of both the Ukraine and Russia.
Democrat stolen money all gets laundered in Ukraine, that's the only reason America cares
Get ready for WW3 folks.
Russia don't care there a worthless military if they did they wouldn't be bomb houses with Civilians in them and little baby's
 @Jesse Melton  the soldiers are just following orders.
Putin and Russia are 
Dear BBC COMMUNITY,I'd be grateful to know if you'd consider my application and dedication for any open position even if it's on the warzone.Thanks & Regards.
If u were in his shoes would you disclose ur plans to ur enemy?. This has been media inspired war from NATO and the US in particular,.
My heart goes out to the innocent people and soldiers of both the Ukraine and Russia.
I didn't expect that reaction from Putin but yeah, decades of western aggression lead to it
My heart goes out to the Ukrainian people.  May god bless Ukrainian safe.  I heard that most of Russian people don't want this war, some relatives of them are in Ukraine.
War is terrible but no one is pointing west's mistakes in this.
Can we gather all the politicians involved in one place? And give them a little taste of ww2?
We pray to God that Ukraine is fine and will resist
All we  want peace.🖤
They are hitting civilians residencies and killing civilians? damn it's really heartbreaking, civilians should leave those places asap
My heart goes out to the civilians ♥
The only person who can save Ukraine is bald and bankrupt
Well, where all the people, mean Bots, the said, Putin want peace and no war?
Fuck Ukrain Things like this happens everyday in Muslim countries because of UK and US but no one bats an eyeBut because it is happening to Ukraine everyone Wakes up?
And history repeats, beyond sad.
What I don't understand it's why Ukraine is not defending, why they don't respond to this attacks
God bless Ukraine. My heart goes out to you all.
I love how humans like watching other humans hurt each other, especially the ones that can stop it.
War-mongers making excuses. What do you expect?
God bless everyone not just Ukraine.
If Putin wants to deNazify things he's on the wrong continent, we have them all here in the US.
JOE BIDEN HAD THE GUTS TO SAY PUTIN IS AFRAID OF  HIMTHE WORLD LAUGHS ITS ASS OFF AT AMERICA !! OUR DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN THEIR GREED AND STUPIDITY HAVE ACCOMPLISHED WHAT THEY WANTED TO DO:  MAKE A GIFT OF THIS COUNTRY TO THE FORCES OF EVIL: SOCIALISM AND COMMUNISM.
Absolutely its insane but that was necessary
I stand with The People Of 🇺🇦!
Когда украинские нацисты убивали русских в Донбассе Запад аплодировал, а когда Россия стала освобождать людей Запад возмутился, потому что Запад - фашистский, им нравится когда убивают русских
why God Why??
Legend cameraman is also present there.
People of Ukraine don't be afraid our prayer is with you ,  you are not alone .
Putin is 7 step ahead of Biden. Putin has complete faith in the incompetency and passiveness of Biden that's the reason he attacked now. I'm just completely amused by the passiveness of Joe Biden, although US has a history of letting their ally for dead just when they needs the most in Biden s time it's a complete Joke. The war would have never started if A strong president was in power today rather than the Joe weak Biden. Just saying pay for Ukraine is not enough.
The whole world apart from China and a few small South American nations are against Russia, they don’t really stand a chance in all our war.
Where were all of you,when the USA attacked Belgrade?It is the same.But Bill Clinton was a hero at this time,and Putin is now a villon.Shame on yourselfs.
China’s invasion of Taiwan is next.
Heartbreaking.
It's only the beginning with no end 😔 God bless , Ukraine ❤❤❤
TO THE UKRAIN... WE ARE COMING  TO THE RUSSIANS... LEAVE THE U.S.A. NOW WHILE YOU STILL CAN
What a terrible war. Long live United Kingdom and USA. As a German I am bee with you. My heart fights for peace and freedom and for United Kingdom and the USA:
war is worse than hell; hell has no innocents.
Your heart fights for peace and freedom? Lies and more lies. What about peace and freedom of Iraq? Afghanistan? Iran? Palestine? And so many others? Maybe you mean peace and freedom for white western countries 👍🏿
Your country is pure evil
Really.... Did You Felt The Same For The People From Afghanistan And Iraq ..Did You!?????
As a non-German, would be great to see NATO-member Germany actually commit to supporting & helping Ukraine more. Not seeing much other than words from Germany and making me wonder if Germany's own interests (e.g. gas pipelines) are being too much prioritized over EU.
 @Gilbert  who cares about them
 @EE  Yes I mean peace and freedom for western countries, but also for your countries. Also for Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran, Palestine etc. I wisch peace for every country. I pray for a peaceful world.
 @Michael Root  Yes, its correct, Germans history was the devil. But I come in peace. I hate war in every country. Freedom and peace for whole mankind.
​ @Lent  I am not a politican. But I agree with ex president Obama in this case.
 @Gilbert  I pray for the people in Afghanistan and Iraq and hope they can live in peace soon.The problem is the faith from western countries and the opinion from the islamic states. Its a problem in faith. I want peace for the world, respect, freedom, self confidence, and a respectfull behaviour with women in catholics and islamic countries.
 @Fido  How could you want peace for those countries while claiming your love for the US and UK?It's like somebody saying they wish for peace in Ukraine but love Putin.
 @EE  Are u a Russian ? I thank the English, Americans and Russians for liberating Germany from Hitler's dictatorship. Because I learned English at school, I feel drawn to the Anglo-Saxons. Russia was foreign to me because of the cold war. But I was on a cruise in St. Petersburg for 2 days. A very beautiful Russian city. Russia is also a beautiful country. But Ukraine wants autonomy from Russia, and Putin should respect that.
Remember IRAK, LIBIA SIRIA, IRAN, YUGOSLAVIA, SERBIA, AFGHANISTAN, KOREA, VIETNAM ETS????
NATO war mongers started this.
The 
Wars are horrible! I hope 🙏  all civilians are protected and this conflict goes as fast as it came.
Where did you find those somber Russian protesters? I'm in Russia right now. I can tell you, that most of Russians support this operation. Too long those western puppets in the Ukrainian government threatened and harassed Russians. Finally Kiev is going to be liberated of them.
This is so sad, God plz protects them
War in 2022! it shouldn't happen! 
I'm surprised that they are moving FASTER than the US&UK did in IRAQ.DAMN RUSSIA, already 15 miles from KIEV.Let me say, i'M NOT SUPPORTING WHAT RUSSIA IS DOING, I'M JUST AN OBSERVER.
Let’s go Brandon!  Biden is a feckless old fool!  We need Trump!!
you dont have to lie , your just after more land
God bless Russia 🇷🇺 🙏
Stay strong 💪 Ukraine my prayers from India 🇮🇳
Poor civilians, war is not solution of this killing, leave Ukrainians alone!
Why would USA and NATO go to the doorsteps of Russia and Poland put bases intimidating them,what did they expect, does Russia have bases in USA borders!
The more we allow Putin to bite off from his neighbors, the more he is going to bite in. We need to stop him NOW, else he will keep attacking everyone around him.
No one is safe this is never gonna stop cluley. Every country is gonna be attacked they are gonna fight no matter what theres already threats towards the west atm. These countrys is just greedy. It's already a start of ww3 and it isnt gonna end. Alot of innocent people is being targeted for what? Stupidity greedy people that dont actually care about people or anything else barred there selfs. Are lifes is at risk because of all this crap. Once they fight and try get what they want they become more greedy and want more to the point t they will carry it on till the whole world dosent exist anymore.
If he attacks Ukraine, he will attack China too. Because China is a bigger threat than Ukraine
you believe in your army?...you have no chance against  prince vlad
Thinking poking the bear was chutzpah, turns out to be normal jewbris
What happened to Palestinians by Israel now happening to Ukraine by Russia
The Ukraine should be a neutral buffer state and should not join the EU or NATO. Nor should it be aligned with Russia. Non-alignment means Ukraine can attract foreign investment and fight corruption.
both biden and zelensky are responsible for this. they didn't have the experience for diplomacy. biden just threatened putin and then instigate the war day after day. zelensky a comedian obviously didn't have experience to defend his country and diplomacy to stop it.
It's so sad this people are so greedy killing this innocent people !!! I hope someday these killer greedy people will be enlighten.. so sad fof Ukraine
He is setting an example for china to invade taiwan.
Don't blame Putin. This has been orchestrated by the US and NATO. Hypocrisy at its finest as per usual.
George Carlin would love this shit
US and NATO at the centre of every war.. we tired of US, Our support goes to Russia
Нам нужны АНОНИМНЫЕ и ОБЪЕДИНЕННЫЕ Герои-Рыцари для человечества, для Украины и для России... Не закрывайте на это глаза. Если в ваших силах остановить это нападение на живописную и мирную страну, пожалуйста, сделайте это сейчас... Человек несет не только юридическую, но и моральную ответственность за соблюдение честных правил. И наоборот, человек несет моральную ответственность за неподчинение несправедливым законам... Он навлекает позор и санкции на Россию… Он делает все, чтобы сохранить свою абсолютную власть; чтобы удержать Украину и Россию от либеральных идей самоопределения и демократии; и сохранить украинские титановые, урановые, марганцевые, железные и ртутные руды. Он правит с помощью украденных выборов, коррупции, неравенства доходов, подавления инакомыслия и вторжения в страны... сейчас самое время жить с честью и состраданием, даже на короткое мгновение... чтобы препятствовать стремящимся к Высшему Тараканам в нашем сообществе… Украина - это народ, а не земля... и когда-нибудь, Россия, ты тоже станешь свободной...
THE SOLUTION IS SIMPLE BUT THE WEST WON'T ACCEPT IT. JUST DON'T THREATEN RUSSIA WITH YOUR NATO EXPANSIONS. ALLOW UKRAINE TO BE A NEUTRAL LAND.
Where is US and NATO
Putin is so bad like his dick got cut off and is not letting go
How Ukraine let those tanks and trucks through their borders is crazy....why no fighting back at the borders..!!!!!!??
Hope the uk doesn’t get involved in this it ain’t our war
Western propaganda continues with lies, as well as when Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, as well as when Syria used chemical weapons, as well as a million times that they lied !!!
This is terrifying... ww3 is here
It's in your nature to destroy yourselves - Terminator 2
Exactly. Unfortunately west is more interested in discord than agreement. Proof? Look at unceasing anti russian rethoric.Do or not, will be condemned regardless.
russian and ukranians are brothers. neonazi politics will have to pay for henocide at donbass. no war!
Kosovo
animals and humans don't deserve this. war is a move made by thugs. Turkey condemns this massacre. 🙏God bless the innocent
People sheltering underground brings back images of World War (images from the past).
Been watching this live all day, raw from Ukrainian people on the streets. They've been hitting civilian targets left and right. Vlad needs to chill.
F*ck Ukraine
In Africa ....this was our day to day experience in the  New Era of neo colonialism now they have turned  against each other
This is just sad! I have no words.
Guess they needed to keep a few nukes.
Funny how countries have suddenly come together to condemn and impose sanctions on Russia when Israel has violated every international law and abused every human right of the Palestinians. Where the hell are the international community when it comes to Israel?
इस लड़ाई में जीतेगा तो रसिया ही
I didn't see Americans supporting Middle Eastern people when US invaded them lol. I remember when we bombed Yemen for 6 years straight and no one gave a single shiz hahaha
It sucks how people only seem to care about the political aspects of this conflict. The fact is, innocent people are dying and something needs to be done. Countering Soviet — now Russian — aggression was the sole reason NATO even exists, now they choose to do nothing. I’m confused. My heart is broken for these people. Russia and China have to be stopped, no matter the cost.
It's great that there putting sanctions in..... But who is helping the ordinary people to fight a vast army???????
Putin knows that the USA and the EU are at the lowest morale in the political arena. Western societies are weak and rotting in corruption. Now facing the biggest threat of this century western countries lack true leadership not narcissistic characters like Canadas PM or Biden who have been weakening their own countries for money and internal power. That’s how empires fall. This is history in the making.
God help everyone
Madara uchiha declared war guys 😂🤣
The power struggle between USA and Russia making life miserable for the poor Ukrainians. I hope this ends soon
Here's what I heard about WW3. The deaths throughout ww2 would the same within a few weeks in ww3. Billions would die (even if nukes wasn't involved)
Care to share the 
Seems like nato has been countering russia ever since soviet union fell apart. Imagine being a new country that already has a military alliance against it, which only expanded with time.All this is the result of western geopolitics and forcing a hand
 @Анатолий К.  Not really. Former Soviet countries including Ukraine wanted to join NATO for this exact reason — to ensure they’d be protected if Russia ever decided they wanted to invade. After being brought to the brink of nuclear war, it would be in everyone’s best interest if the Soviet Union stayed dead and the best way to do that is to strengthen the alliance by allowing ex Soviet nations to join. NATO is a defensive alliance not an offensive one. Russia blamed NATO for this, but it was Putin that decided to invade Ukraine not the west. There aren’t any NATO troops or bases in Ukraine. They simply feared for their safety and expressed a desire to join NATO for protection against the very events that are unfolding. Mind you, most NATO nations object to Ukraine joining because they don’t meet the requirements and it will be a long time before they do. As such, Ukraine poses no threat to Russia. Putin created this crises because he wants to resurrect the Soviet Union. Putin is caught in some sort of delusional nostalgia and refuses to accept that the Soviet Union is dead and isn’t coming back. He called the Soviet collapse the worst geopolitical catastrophe in history. Even Russian elites and citizens are protesting or otherwise denouncing his decision. Putin alone thought this was a good idea.
I'm sure Putin  had his reasons! Ahh I love russia
Misuse of power .
Im inclined to believe Russia is correct, especially since the lying MSM is pushing the narrative that Russia is the bad guys.
Come on russia love from iran
I always thought Putin can be a Hitler but I never knew it would be this near
O lord come and intervene
He needs taking out, he’ll take Russia down with him otherwise.
Ukraine President sound worse tha Biden
stay out of mainstream media
Sending our prayers from Haiti 🇭🇹
Why we keep on warring each other. Why we keep on repeating history?
Lay down now!💪😤
USA NATO MISTAKES TRYING TO DIVIDE UKRAINE RUSSIA CONTINUATION OF GLOBAL IMPERIALISM DANGEROUS 15 MINUTES ONLY THE WORLD TELLS NO TALE OF HISTORY
We need to drop some nukes on them already fuck all this diplomacy shit. Let’s see who can give the Loudest warning shot and whose bluffing.
Don’t be scared now y’all were pre warned should have been long gone
Zelenskyi and NATO did trigger this. But Putin always wanted to reestablish the late Russian Empire's territory. He said that 
Funny how independent channels are quicker to getting these already shown videos, channels like WarLeaks. Rather then all these big dollar mainmedias (MnM’s) news corps.
The world can be a horrible place. God bless and stay safe Ukraine
Pointless wars
The world needs peace and love not war.
Putin is a murderer, a thief, and a liar and going against what he claims he believes.
Putin doesn't want to physically destroy your country but purge it out of 
Bully that's what you are
putin has a right to invade Ukraine for the genocide on the eastern Ukraine people i love how the media always lies to us and the protesters being arrested what about the canadian protesters who where attacked and beat by canadian police for peacefully protesting in ottawa the media has lost all accountability cause they only tell there side of the story what they want you to hear
#stopthewar
Praying for Ukraine

Ukraine I love you praying for u love from South Africa
putin wants to prove something to this world for nothing
Putin is rekindling a 🔥 and the west is throwing the oil....Poor civilians that are caught up in all this mess 😒😟🥺
Thank you nato for provoking Ukraine and Russia
It looks to me like Putin is nothing more than a murderer why they can’t hold him as that going in and killing innocent people and lying and saying that that’s not his agenda he has done nothing but lie from the beginning he’s a liar and he is a thief and a murderer and going against what he believes hypocritical ass.
ukraine is the distraction..... hes building up his forces in syria on the border of Israel. these are biblical times my friends remember were are in the end times jesus is coming
Ukrainian people should have stopped NATO and Zelensky when they had a chance
end of humanity.

 @Kendra  firstly understand what I typed than comment don't jump like a puppy...
Strong people, you are in our hearts- the rest of the world.
Poor civilians. Globalist big shove towards Russia to make them conform It’s all lies.
In this day and age people are still fighting over territory.
Why can’t the Super Power Countries stop the war and conflict around the world? The fact that the Super Powers do not want to resolve the issue for their own interest cannot be accepted due to loss of millions innocent lives.We are very much frustrated to see the United Nations as the most mandated body in the world fail to stop the ongoing genocide and persecutions against the people of the world.We hope for the United Nations and the Super Power Countries to use their power to stop the War Genocide, The United Nations and the Super Power Countries must take special measures to end the Genocide, war and conflict around the world rather than struggling for more budgets to cope with the increase numbers of refugees, asylum seekers, internally displace persons and stateless persons around the world.We only ask for one thing from the United Nations, Super Power Countries and the International Community at large. Please STOP the War Genocide, and conflict. Save the innocent people around the world without further delay.  We suffered enough. So many people died during first and second world war. We cannot have another war. War is not a solution. We are struggling to fight Covid 19. Please end War, Genocide & Conflict.#Russia#Ukrain#myanmar #ChinaThank you.Zafar Ahmad Abdul GhaniA Human Rights Defender and President of Myanmar Ethnic Rohingya Human Rights Organization in Malaysia( MERHROM)
Sometimes things are so clear but on one takes action to stop these things what a fucked up world are we living in these days
Hope everyone is safe 🙏 ❤  my heart goes out to all the civilians ❤
Western puppet Zelensky is the reason innocent Ukrainian loosing their life.. What a scumbag!
USA won again for starting a war.
ዩክሬን አሜሪካንን ከሀገራችው አባሩ በቃ  Ukraine's American, the country's AWET  NO MORE
BBC said and report it correctly that nato and us cheat Ukrainian people Boris himself cannot give working class people of his country justice
Russia will Pay!
I slept well last night and thought today would be an uneventful and good day.I woke up to news of Ukraine being invaded and it really made me sad that people woke up to sirens and panic unlike me.I pray for Ukrainians 😔
He doesn’t want Ukraine to join NATO and doesn’t want NATO forces on his door step. Sad of the civilians who have to pay the price but mainstream media will never report the truth. 🤷🏽
Sounds like US lead operation 'Freedom Iraq'..... Liberate Iraq, Lybia, Syria, Yamen from the regime rule.....This time RUSSIA to take charge of same daram
Putin is like a real man...Once he puts-in he does not pull out...Hope Pakistan learns a lession from this, if India attacks they will not be able to withstand even 48 hours...
Poor civilians. Globalist big shove towards Russia to make them conform It’s all lies.
Putin king💪

Must be a big ego massage speaking for the rest of the world?
 @Burton Rd Forever 1977  Sure maybe I was wrong stating the rest of the world.
https://youtu.be/2lUGNcwQo8I
 @Burton Rd Forever 1977  chill out Jesus Christ.
 @Shaun Thomas  Nothing wrong with what you said, if people want to be difficult for no reason just ignore them. The rest of the world does have Ukraine in their hearts.
 @Grant Ashby  but you don’t know anything about it, again we shouldn’t be meddling in Ukraine, if Russia decided they wanted to start arming Ireland what do you think we England would do? There only trying to protect themselves, I don’t believe anything the bbc say anyway...,
 @Longdong Silver  What I said was in levity. I wouldn't take the BBC as a fair, balanced news outlet. They're not mentioning the NATO stranglehold encircling Russia. They'd have you believe its just been done out of an imperialistic yearning to create history. There's always two sides to a conflict.
 @Shaun Thomas  Was only playing mate. Nothing wrong with your message.
 @Longdong Silver  okay mate, nothing I said was to do with that....main comment is about letting know that we have sympathy for the people of Ukraine that wanted nothing to do with the war. Don't know what the hell you are on about, you sound just as clueless as everyone else. All I know is that people shouldn't be dying in their homes when it wasn't their fight to begin with.
Yup, still stuck 1000 years in the past 😢
Umm... everyone is not safe.
Moldova has opened up their boarders to allow Ukraine's families to enter. They are under a State of Emergency for 60 days.

Modern Ukraine is no threat to Putin!!! Putin is a grossly impotent leader. Just a short man with a power struggle within himself. Get some therapy Putin! Killing innocent people won’t silence that internal war!
ALL WARS ARE BANKERS WARS
Propaganda that won't change sh*t is always funny. America killed millions in Afghanistan and many other countries but nothing was said about the bullies as they deem themselves untouchable
PEACE ON EARTH ✌️ 🗺
i understand the aspect of fleeing, for saftey but to see so many ppl let their fear get to them, i can never leave my home while someone breaks in, i will stay and fight, no one wants this war and it’s clear russia does so let’s shut em down asap. fuck the democrats and republicans this is for humanity.
Putin is the new Hitler. Which country is next?

Russia IS the threat
1:29 - 1:35 This sounds like an excuse someone like Hitler or Stalin would make.
Oh please, this is the BBC, they have not mentioned the Canadian truchers, how can you believe anything this bullsh1t organization has to say. It is all a one sided narrative that suites the 1% ters.

How can one be so comfortable fighting another human being over territory?
I love Russia
Praying for Ukraine
More crap from the beeb
I hope Ukraine is okay. I’m scared for them. Why can’t we just all get along. A war won’t fix anything only create damage. I don’t want WWIII and nobody else does. Expect for maybe Putin. I hate this world.
Russia wasn’t bullshittin
Putin is an evil liar that is willing to take innocent lives as the world stands by and watches. Even worse the Russian people wander their streets crying crocodile tears for Ukrainians and do absolutely nothing. Putin is a disgrace as well as those that can do something and yet do nothing. Sad...Just sayin'
Jesus please save your world
1.5 million people in a refugee camp for  no fault of their own, hundreds of thousands of people else where displaced from governments. The people of the world are sick of the Adults? Who are meant to lead. There's a song I like but the main line goes we shared more when we had less Love to Ukraine and love to Russia, nothing comes from war, no matter how you dress it up murder is murder!!! Spread love not war, I know one thing!! get Russian and Ukrainian kids in a room and they will play and have fun and some will share and be kind,and they probably wouldn't mention where they lived,oh maybe they'd say Earth !!! Mr Putin I don't ever want to see anyone use Nuclear weapons against Russia or anyone,or anywhere else in the worldLet's take an example from the kids!!!! Come on get along with each other it's easier than not getting along.I pray for peace and love ,and children to be safe!!!
If only did westerns worry about civilians in middle East. Their heart goes out for the Ukrainian because they are in clash with Russia. Nothing but discrimination. Btw I'm supporting Ukraine, this isn't stone age where you can target a sovereign nation.
Putin is just another garbage dictator along with stalin and the other goofballs durning the cold war.  They are like a virus that tries to spread itself.  Putin probably has a poster of stalin in leather over his bed.
As Russia invades Ukraine as if he is Hitler invading Poland, he calls them nazis.
Russia wasn't going to stop from the beginning.  Putin isn't playing by the rules while the West still is.  Go in there and help Ukraine with troops. NATO alone has 30 nations. Why isn't the west fighting for democracy? Oh yeah, because that's the only major agenda of this war, is preserve it. It doesn't have oil money or anything of the benefits the Western oligarchs can benefit from. smh. With NATO troops in Ukraine, they cant at least stalemate this.

 @Kendra  talking about don't let the media fool you. I sure won't let a dictator fool me.
Maybe because NATO expanded up to the Russian Federation borders? Why can't you just go and educate yourself instead of writing all this garbage on youtube? xD
Ukraine has been bothering russia for lots of years. Now they have pissed off Putin. They asked for it
Moldova has opened up the boarders to allow Ukraine's families to enter. They are under a State of Emergency for 60 days to save people! They have set up emergency camps to keep them safe! 🇺🇦🙏❤️🇨🇦
Putin wants the Nuclear power supply stations. His troops have taken over. WW3
Putin just wonet save Russia because NATO and USA won't put ballistic rocket in Ukraine. NATO just go home Ukraine is much save when NATO is not there! ;)
What happened to Israel and Palestine? So many things are happening, I can't keep up.
The Expansion of Belarus 🕊️✌️ to bring peace in the region 🤔 Simple fix 🤔 return to your home and lay down your arms and wait for Europe and  NATO to speak peacefully 🕊️✌️ in 50 years the Expansion will continue to bring Peace 🕊️✌️
Praying for Ukraine 🇺🇦 hoping all its citizens furthermore stay protected. 🙏
What actually are they fighting forthere should be sth in the ukraine that theyre all running after
just fight back lmao
Ww3 may be in the works. If not. Then Ukraine is done for
Where is the proof of Putin about his complaint?
Its time to give the Ukrainian heavy air defense systems. I liked Putin but if he does north stop he can sign up to the list of war criminals and we at the west need to hit him hard with all means necessary to stop him. remember? Hitler started the same way and no one caved his face in on time until it was too late. Time to move all NATO troops close to the border and drown Putin economically.
Where is the drone of ukraine? I think bayraktar are useless in this war.
Shame to everyone who criticized Biden for saying Russia will invade and shame to those who said Russia will not invade.
Russia have it’s own reason, so don’t be panic
Let's go Russia fuck Ukraine
C'est terrible pour l'Ukraine!!!
From Canada I pray you all are ok in Ukraine
Learn from the past war bring only deaths, no side wins

This is all about putin's ego. He knows he doesn't have much time left and he wants to be remembered in Russian lore.
Good 🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
I'm sorry for the people of Ukraine ,but NATO and USA are biggest killers and conflict producers in the world.
Stay strong Ukraine, NATO and Europe is waking up.
PRAY FOR UKRAINE🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🇵🇭
Evil Putin! When Christ comes back on earth which is sooner he have a lot to answer to him why he chose to be evil
Russian Woman: I think Ukraine should surrender. BBC: This is not a war Russians back. 90% of Russian back the peace keeping mission. The western media have told us for 8 years that the fighters in Eastern Ukraine are Russian soldiers, now they are saying Russia is invading. How can Russia invade somewhere you claim they have been fighting for 8 years? Western propaganda is silly! They want a war so bad and Putin is always one step ahead of the West warmongers. Ukraine's elected president was toppled by a mob sponsored by western nations, 40% of Ukrainians who are ethnic Russians did not support that coup, so the new regime backed by the neo-nazi Azov militia, NATO, U.S., U.K. and the west began using force on ethnic Russians and also banned the use of Russian language in Eastern Ukraine. Russia pushed for dialogue but the neo-nazis dismissed the leaders of east Ukraine as terrorists and continue using force against them. The west have been funding them and backing them and dragging the peace process for 8 years and promising Ukraine nato membership. Putin and Russia have had enough. America and the west recognised Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence and now have a NATO base there, why should Russia allow a repeat of America and NATOs recklessness and aggression against Russian people?
Putin you rascal what you playing at
Russia learning well from Israel
Stop this why is this even aloud to happen wtf , my heart goes out fuck that! Help them
You have 2 months time after ultimatum but the arogance is still to  high to improve the relations.Idiotic leaders like Ursula and Trudeau
What did Ukraine do??? Nobody gives clear explanation.
PUTIN IS RIGHT
I still remember....it was September, 1991.Sunday, air alert....I'll never forget that sound....Planes....above Zagreb....Frightened faces of my parents...I was just 11 and owerhelmed with war.Now I'm 42 and my son is almost 11 and I don't know how to explain to him something even I don't understand.War is never a solution.Peace from Croatia for Ukraine ❤
Selfish world
Why the fuck aren't we or the EU doing anything.   We have no problem fighting dumb wars in middle east.  Now that there's a real war the US and the EU do nothing.     It would be moral to help Ukraine.
Why didn't everyone want to notice what Ukrainians were doing in Donbass and Lugansk? they shot at local residents there as targets eight years ago, they staged a genocide in their country against the Russian-speaking population, and no one cared, that's why these regions wanted to separate from Ukraine, and now, with the help of the United States, Ukrainians are trying to show themselves as victims. The world has gone crazy. It was not Russia that wanted this war, but the United States and the political elite of Ukraine. With their puppet president, that I'm crying to everyone, what a bad Russia. And Russia made their prices cheaper for gas, so they also stole gas from the pipe.
Tell putin to swing by DC after he wraps up over there if he really wants to stop whats corrupting ukraine
Putin finally showed his true colors, I fear for Taiwan now.
I am from KENYA and I believe this is wrong, there is always diplomatic means to solve international conflicts. #STOP UKRAINE INVASION . Let us share this world wide.
Why hasn't France or USA or UK stopped Ukrainian shelling and killing of people in Donetsk and Lughansk..❓❓rThey had 8 years to do it.. The West and Ukrainian government is SO FAR responsible for the deaths of 14,000 people in that area. r14,000.....When does one go to war?? What is the limit?  3,000 people as in 9/11 ❓❓
Saudi Arabia has been bombing Yemen for years. Yet, no outrage from the West?
Putin=Hitler
Yeah yeah BBC news😂
To whose interest is Putin doing all these for? If it's in the interest of the entire Russian populace,  then I ask again, 
NETO USA   tought its afganista libia or irak .
I’m sending up the most powerful prayer too our Creator for our human race…You’ll thank me later…
There are so many consulates, briefings, and such diplomatic stuff, but still, people just can't resolve a problem without a war.
I hope this doesn't start WW3. The US lacks the proper leadership to enter a war right now.But maybe that weakness is exactly why this is happening in the first place
And biden wont do nothing ...... everybody that voted for biden you get what you voted for thats a female president and scared to attack back
Just give up like the Afghanistan army did! Peaceful take over and no one gets hurt! Civilian are only going to die because of war madness
The rest of the world must intervene. Everyone send everything to that area. Get your nukes ready.
40 years of war in Afghanistan 🇦🇫 (50 civilian victims each day) and finally the end of it last year and nobody cared about it. A sad world for Afghan people.Still, we stand with Ukraine 🇺🇦✊🏻 ❤️ 🌎
If people would understand Putin's intentions for this war u can only support him on this
That is because Putin is hell bent on taking over Ukraine !!!!!!
My grandmother used to say if u want peace prepared for WAR smh...
You can't reason with a ruthless psychopath that lies about everything.
That's because the man who started it does not want a resolution.
There wasn't even a real conflict to begin with… it's just mindless violence, so utterly absurd.
That was against terrorist.. This is innocent people.. Afghanistan was better before I think. Look at Afghan now no food.
 @Raja Vishnuvardhana  Are you trying to tell me that Afghan people were not innocent?
 @Raja Vishnuvardhana  Indian sponsored terrorists destroyed a country called Sri Lanka in the 80's... they are innocent too
Didn’t Afghanistan get attacked cause the 9 11
 @Julio Rubalcava  tell me please who really were responsible for the attack of 9/11. They pray yearly for thousands of American people, who died in this day (and so do I). But not for million Afghans, who died for 20 years, because they started the war and are responsible for that.
 @Julio Rubalcava  Why do you attack a country which had nothing to do with 9/11 all of the attackers were from Saudi Arabia....why not attack the Saudis the whole 9/11 was an inside job according their own investigations.
this is F###ing sick
Is this the Putin you all saying that he's cool and lovely
Don't believe a word of bbc's interpretation on anything.  Their stifling vax-related informed consent through murderous censorship should teach you something about the evil that they are.  There's something else going on here. Do your research.  Don't let these evils narrow your informed understanding on anything.
Putin and Biden making NATO look weak.
Listen, the time has come. The kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe the good news.Mark 1:15 Please think about it. Believe in God's son Jesus today, repent of your sin, heaven is perfect dont be left behind. Love Y'all
US and NATO so weak and so chicken to fight the Russia. Just stand there talk shit.
My descendants are Ukrainian and polish I pray hard and every day that there could be peace in the world and for the ukraines to finally have eternal freedom.... ❤️❤️
Maybe we need another epidemic... That was the only thing that kept us all united...Shame on all the greedy and selfish politicians
The reporter seems flustered, everyone knows this is rediculous.
Putin is a demon
No man should be leaving. They need to be picking up a weapon and defend their country.
Hope this doesn't  get even worse.
All the mainstream media wanted war & now they've got it
I’m in the UK and I have the unnerving fear that a bomb will just blow me up.What is this world.
It’s scary because everything is intelligent said was right so far, which means the concentration camps could be tru too
They should hire an assassin to assassinate Putin
Wait...did people think Putin was bluffing or something??  Apparently the joke's on them; I never got the impression that Putin was a bluffer.
I hate putin now
Well NATO better get in there
Why the Ukraine blive in Neto
USA is not going to sadly
Sending big up to Russia and Putin
Makes it a pity you can't have world militia volunteer call ups with the understanding it's not supported by their government. Maybe then people wouldn't just send their heart but carry arms. That said how do you fight a war man to man or woman when jets and missiles can take you out. No future war will be on a level playing field.
NATO ARE SCARED. PUSSIES.
trump must have known this was coming. no one goes to war unless you prepare for years. thanks trump, it wasnt america that you wanted destroyed. It was the world!
this is so tragic all those people are stuck there, it sends chills down my spine and true sorrow for them, may god be with them all through all of this. Nobody wanted this
Почему вы молча наблюдали как убивала Украина детей Донбасса 8 лет, а здесь заверещали, раскудахтались, позорники, трусы и мерзавцы, базарные сплетники и лжецы, позор вам мерзавцы.
As if the Ukraine was a threat what a piece of … I will refrain, murderous bustards.
Westerners have little idea what russia means to neighboring countries.Just look at their history... only one obsession: russian empire. Under different names but still the same idea.
we are in a pandemic for gods sake. COVID already destroyed half of the world and now WWIII. Please this is not the generation to start war.
Third World War !!!!!
This will end in a Atomic war..

west shouldnt treat Russia like enemy in the first place when They are not enemy and Russia always provide gas to Europe.    sanction on Russia this and that, endless,  even in Olympic games, their name cannot be used. and  manipulating ukraine polititians, this is beyond bullying.  and They should know if Russia fight back, what will happen
Push the button and get it over with!
When a select few have all the power, this is the result.
i can see putin perspective . he reaally doesnt want NATO in his doorstep thats why hes doing this . people will hate him but hes doing it for russia interest. imo
Supposedly Ukrainian government is handing out guns to whoever wants them. That puts it in starc contrast
I am from Iraq and I know how I feel about their civilian. when it was USA and UK and Europe coming to Iraq and thay are killed everything animal old Man old woman little baby and young people every secondsAnd they're taking everything from my landJust like a stroller or scammer do.
I bet these people just lay down arms and cry 😢 to the world for help!
nato did, and thats why they didn't allow russia into nato
This is how Palestinians feel every day and have been for decades, America is funding and supporting Isreal while they do the same thing to Palestinians.
This is what happens when you have weak lefty western leaders like Biden. Western woke lefty liberals are making a mistake by thinking the whole world shares their ideology. China is also laughing at the west and spreading militarily. Liberals are going to destroy the west unless people wake up.
The government's and people in power wanted this.
 @tubester4567  Russia is supported by the Conservatives
 @Immy Hussain  well no shit thats why they are invading
 @1jzash  are u alright mate? Don't get your panties in a twist mate 😅
 @Immy Hussain  no ur just stating the obvious
 @1jzash  I liked your comment. I thought I'd add to the thread. Calm down buttercup, it's alright 👍
 @Immy Hussain  i am calm i just said u stated the obvious lol
 @1jzash  ok Karen 👍
Shut up you don’t really care
All this fake virtue signaling sympathy in the comments. If y’all don’t shut y’all fake asses up lol
 @Marcus Green  u what mate 🤣 another Karen here.
SOMEONE WANTED IT OR IT WOULD NOT BE HAPPENING! - get facts straight - sick of ignorant comments
 @Immy Hussain  NATO did.NATO are the ones who didn't let Russia join, opposed them and Russia needed Ukraine in-between to act as a buffer stateStop believing all the shit you see on social media
 @cutpricetech  obviously no shit russia wanted this but no one wanted russia to do this dumbass lol
 @tubester4567  the US has no place in western politicsYou act like it's a horrible war yet nobody weeped over half a million dying in Iraq because they were brown
This is why the first amendment and second are so important do not take it for granite for a second no other country in the world has these amendments. Seems inevitable however that we seem to want to lose these because of hate speech and canceling those who do not go with the agenda.
Where are the UNITED NATIONS? WIPE PUTIN'S SORRY BUTT OFF THE MAP AND SHUT THE PARTY DOWN.
Why will u join Nato then u can just be neutral u do stupid things all poltican tactics. Feel sorry for civilians
We let hitler take the Slovakian area. We gave hitler 
I wish we would intervene and fight the Russians. Unfortunately, I feel nukes prevent this. I would be very concerned that if the west clashes with Russia or China it would very quickly lead to nuclear war.
Putin only understands strength. This is another Cuban missile crisis. NATO forces must ramp up and Putin must believe they are ready to retaliate. Perhaps a bluff but outrage in the west and sanctions will not stop him.
Путин е убиец
Prayer for people who those in trouble in  Jesus Christ name.Amen
What about Iraq in 2003, why did no one interfere in that when they killed innocent people?
Ukrain  must need surrendering  now
6.55 , so true..
Sad😭
What USA is doing give some action
what is the car at @2:39
Afghan war cost ...raw data ofcourse  241000 souls. 20 year. 2 trillion usd. Much more on both sides.     And  Outcome zerooooo.Plz dont ever believe USA gov for anything.
Trump has finally fulfilled his dream of starting WWIII.
we love you ukraine,
Why oh why is one greedy power hungry cold blooded evil dictator the one to lead so many innocent lives? I want to hug Ukraine.
We don’t trust mainstream media, BBC is one of those MSM. 👎CNN, MSNBC, Washington post, New York Times are all fake news 📰 👎.
No one really interferes now either. Are you happy now?
Trump isn't president anymore.
NATO forced Russia to wage war... All of this is NATO's fault
Our leaders are waiting for blood on their hands....playing with weapons they don't understand...could it be this time we'll see...the end of the world...?
Fuck russia
Send the letter I will join

USA needs to send in long range artillery and shoulder fired aircraft missiles, had i been president this would have been done 4 yrs ago
Russia needs a New Leader and fast. Cause I guarrentee the Russian Citizens dont want War. Prayers
Time to destroy Russia
IT IS SO SAD THAT WE HAVE A HISTORY OF HITLERS, PEOPLE LIKE THAT SOULD BE REMOVED,
Thank you for the Rothschild propaganda. Where were those 
Putin is evil!   Prayers 🙏
This is Biden and NATO terrorists war. Look at how many countries the US and NATO has destroyed. Go Russia!
Like 8 random clips of smoke and a little flame and then say Russia attacked? If Russia attack it wont be a little smoke and a small flame trust me.
Complete lies. Show a vid of a bomb and it becomes a russian bomb. Tanks driving down the road  now appear to be 
Why Ukraine don't have an army???
Hey! Ukraine 🇺🇦 no body cares!
I pray for peace
Yes and no
 @fan  encircling Russia by making every damn post-ussr-divison country a part of NATO... If this is not forcing I am not sure what is
 @Target CISSP  not forcing though
There not going to even help I think
No just the leader not all the civilians they did nothing
We are never told in the U.S. that a major party in Ukraine is a Neo Nazi group and yet we are supposed to defend that? Ukraine has cut off water to Crimea since they succeeded and its no wonder that Russia wants to protect its flank from vindictive neo nazis threatening all the time. Stay out and let two countries settle their dispute. We have wasted enough blood and money on war in the last 20 years. Just crazy an establishment candidate gets back in the White House and suddenly a new war pops up???
So they say Russia can't feel safe because Ukraine might attack, so they attacked them. How the hell is this the official statement, what the hell is wrong with this stupid fkn country. Russia you just nuked the public opinion back o the damn stone age. You will NEVER financially recover from this mess, you are so fucked. Enjoy being the new North Korea you complete idiots.
kill all press
I am Italian, my country has two enclaves within it, we pay taxes for every  fkg church in italy and there are 900 in rome alone, we could easily defeat the swiss guards armed with spears I suppose and sometimes when drunk we joke about conquering san marino and the vatican, but jeeez russia what's fkg wrong with you...
Arrested for protesting, guys idk but it's germany 1939 all over again
When this happens, the income of news agencies like BBC increases
What a hipocresy sendinng weapons to create news and Sell news, online and papersIugh, 🤢 i tink to just, el pasquin do that
Ah shit here we go again
We should pray for peace in ukraine,
Trump 
They really need to get Putin out of office over there
umm,he cant be serious can he?putina needs help mentally,he is not all there and he is getting worse all the time.I honestly did not think  he would do it.The Russian nation should remember what a world war cost them barely 77 years ago,surely the good people of Russia dont ever want to go there again and hopefully Russian people can put pressure on this person to reign him in.has no one learnt any lessons from the carnage and total waste of life that happened in ww2? not even 100yrs has past and  we are on the cusp again why?
Русия!Напред!
Why is Russia's Putin so focused on Ukraine?Must Watch 
I know someone smiling to the bank now............the war financiers of Europe and America. It's already affecting me here my gas shot 30 US cents in 2 hours.
Ukraine shot malaysia airline mh17 in 2014. All 283 passengers and 15 crew were killed.. no one do anything abt that..
May God protect the people of Ukrain and may he forbid a war
Keep saying the 
Thanks
Well personally I'm rooting for Russia. Ukraine shouldn't even resist.
This irrational man Putin, must be  placed where he belonges, the era of Stones. UKRAINE HAS THE RIGHT TO BELONG TO EUROPEAN UNION and the right of autodetermination. Putin is under  CENTUTIES of irrational years of battles and wars. This is not the WORLD WE NEED. WE NEED UKRAINE FREE AND IN EUROPE!!
Russian dictator Pukin! Don't be shy calling things what it is.
Scene: in an alternative realityPutin: “I’ve come to repossess what’s rightfully mine.”Zelensky: “Really? But this is a sovereign self-governing territory.”Putin: “Oh, silly me. I think I may have the wrong address. Good day.”😳
Putin is a pathetic liar. He should never be trusted. I'm praying for the people of Ukraine. Using childish and imaginary reasons to invade is a cowardly action.
This is the reality of this world, weak countries get swallow by stronge onces china on taiwan and Amerika on Afghanistan, Syrië, iraq, soo americans shouldn’t act like they have “ sympathie” for ukrainien
Under the sun, evil politians play the evils games.
Amrica and Netto distroit Iraq Afghanistan Libiya yemen syria.now is Turn of hokrain
Israel did the same thing on Palestine every in a while and all of European Countries, USA were supporting Israel's similar crime!
Innocent people are always suffering due to these horrible war crimes,so scary, hope innocent people and children are going to be safe 🌷🕊️❤️
The world just watched did nothing when Germany invaded Poland in 1939. We cannot repeat that same mistake again. Putin must be stopped.
WHOLE WORLD WATCHING THE UNLAWFUL AND DEVELISH MIND OF DESTROYING UKRAINE INNOCENT PEOPLE  BY CRUEL WAR WEAPONS, THRETENING PEOPLE TO SURRENDER AS SLAVES, WHAT IS GOING TO ACHIEVE PUDIN?
I’m a former Moscow correspondent. Don’t let Vladimir Putin fool you: Russia’s war in Ukraine is only about one thing.If you walk the streets of Moscow, you will eventually smell the faint odor of gasoline.Any crimp on Russia’s ability to access the European market is a threat to its economic security.To get it there, Russia relies mostly on two aging pipeline networks, one of which runs through Belarus and the other through Ukraine. For this, Russia pays Ukraine around $2 billion a year in transit fees.Russia is a petrostate and relies on oil and natural-gas sales for about 60% of its export revenue and 40% of its total budget expenditures. Any crimp on Russia’s ability to access the European market is a threat to its economic security.As Ukrainians looked to rising living standards in places like Poland and Latvia that had joined NATO and the European Union, many wondered why they couldn’t have the same for themselves.This is where Putin’s nationalistic impulses kick in. He views the fall of the Soviet Union as the “greatest geopolitical tragedy” of the past century and the rush of  former Eastern bloc countries into the embrace of the European Union, and even NATO, as a great humiliation.He has drawn a line in the sand with countries that border Russia, invading Georgia in 2008 when it hinted at joining NATO, and moving to destabilize Ukraine when it moved to establish closer economic ties with Europe.Domestically, Putin has sold the incursions into Ukraine on purely nationalistic grounds — even going so far this weekend as to dismiss Ukraine’s history as an independent country as a falsehood.https://www.marketwatch.com/story/im-a-former-moscow-correspondent-dont-let-vladimir-putin-fool-you-russias-war-in-ukraine-is-only-about-one-thing-11645571878?mod=home-pageLest we forget 👇 GOP campaigns took $7.35 million from oligarch linked to Russia. Donald J. Trump and the political action committees for Mitch McConnell, Marco Rubio, Scott Walker and Lindsey Graham accepted $7.35 million in contributions from oligarch who is the business partner of two of Russian president Vladimir Putin's favorite oligarchs and a Russian government bank.
Putin: 
Well hopefully Ukraine will Look like Iraq, Libya, Syria, and most of Africa oh I 4got Kashmir.
It look like  Irak Afganistán Libia
Praying 🙏 for the poor people
The South Florida way of sanctioning Russia for Ukraine invasion If we’re going to talk about imposing crippling sanctions against Russia as an effective nonlethal response to Vladimir Putin’s military invasion of Ukraine, let’s not forget South Florida.The owners of many condos in Trump Tower II and III in Sunny Isles Beach have ties to Russia, The Miami Herald has found.South Florida is awash with the flight capital of Russian oligarchs, people who’ve received Putin’s blessing to loot their country and then keep their ill-gotten riches tucked safely away in the form of American real estate.Watch 
Racist Ukrainian neo-nazis. I hope Russia destroys them.
How do we the People know the other side didn't plant a thew bomb and then blame it on Russian to try and legitimatise another war in the mind of the People. They have to pacify your mind before you will excepts a invading force discussed as a defending force. Trust nothing the TV say's    (     ;
How about ‘rooting’ for human beings? That would be a start.
Dont misinform people. NATO is a military alliance and has nothing to do with economy. Unless you profit from selling weapons and war.
The whole media started barking and howling.
How much do you want to bet me that we wont hear any more about CV19. This is Brandon's war, and if you voted for him, the blood is on your hands. This never would have happened under Trump. But, thank god, no more mean tweets!
Those civilian blocks of flats are shattered. I wonder how many people died.
Russian out of Eurooe ! Close the Russian ambasaye and send them all to Russia.
Pakistan support russia
This is sad . Wtf is he doing .
This is all happening right now because of our crap president and NATO... This was provoked by the United States and our allies, Russia has to protect itself... What do you think America would do if there were Russian nukes on both the Mexican and Canadian borders? She would protect herself...
Imagine. Israel has been doing exact same thing to Palestinians for the last 70 years almost every day.Who noticed?
What about Civilian ?
One thing we can do to help is to differentiate between Russian's citizens and Russian's government. The citizens of Russia and Ukraine, just like in every conflict, are not on board and just want to live their lives in peace. It is a small group of stubborn men in power (Putin) that are prepared to sacrifice EVERYONE and everything for their ambition. It's not Russia doing this, it is PUTIN.
Propaganda,  Nato is the cause of all of this and the world knows it.
I can give Ukraine a good idea when russia attacking there country ,Ukraine should send some war jet and bomb Russia and that will force Russia army to pull back and defend there country,come on Ukraine be smart send some jet to blast and destroyed Russia and see if they will not has to fall back to defend there country ,fight fire with fire that's how I think ,I want them kill puttin,I don't like that devil
We all gonna die any second
US gets cold the world should sneeze. The media should howl and bark. Where were you when Israel bombed helpless Palestinians and  Gazzans. Shame on you for patiality.
Isn't it strange how this happens when the 
Trump is defending and backing and praising Putin, against the sitting president. So Trump is giving aid and comfort to the enemy. What’s the current, most severe punishment for proven treason?
USA and nato you reap what you sow.
America wants to control the world and Brain wash everyone to think they are good. This is not the truth and smart people know this
And this is how world war 3 begins.
#FreeUkraine #CriminalPutin
Well it seems like you did.
Next thing is going to be a staged alien invasion.
Avery 2nd russian -are Putin.
Absolutely heartbreaking to see families being destroyed by a tyrant dictator, respect to Ukraine for its bravery 🇺🇦🇺🇦
Putin watched how we handled Afghanistan and saw that we’re completely inept. Our president (Biden) is not competent, Boris Johnson is not the person to lead this.
Hopefully, he fears more for his people than his job. I suspect he does.
Does  Putin  want to go down  in history  as the next Hitler  ?
We must do more to help !!!!!! this is unfathomable, where the fucks Nato!!!!!!
Lord lead this people🙏🙏
The great reset
I support Ukraine from Turkey 🇹🇷 🇺🇦
امریکہ فرانس برطانیہ جرمنی کیوں نہیں مدد کر رہے یوکرین کی؟؟؟؟؟

Isn’t this what you did when Russia came to Cuba…hypocrites western pigs…what about the Middle East you destroyed? Where ever you go you leave a trail of destruction…you started isis, you started al Qaeda…Russia came and defeated isis
Putin is Angry, homosexual president
Surrender is inevitable; the only other alternative is WWIII. It's somewhat ironic how nuclear weapons have weakened the moral position immeasurably: the immoral position has but to convince us that WoMD will be used unconditionally, and we're powerless to intervene.

Usa did the same with MexicoBut unfortunately youtube was not there

 @Viktor Svetlov  what?
says a western ( U( K....how hypocrtic
oh no the waves of cyberattacks are coming now
My uncle lives in Luhansk, stop telling me... yes, under Putin, life is not sweet for us either, but he is NOT a TYRAN!!!
 @Viktor Svetlov  fuck off.. you started the war..
 @Lichtfalter75  the war started with the 2014  US NATO led coup .
راح يجي يوم 🙂متكدر تنام من الفرحه🥰بس كول يا الله 🙏ربك ما ينسه عبده❤️
I hope Ukraine surrenders quick at this point it's the option with the less deaths
That's exactly how We Serbs felt 1999 when the same thing did NATO to us...
Our good saviour lord is with you my brother n sister from Ukraine... Stay strong ...Even if the Russian want to destroyed you,the whole world is on your side Ukraine
The new world is emerging America is not in control of the world we need balance of power.
Now report on western politicians that are profiting from this conflict!    You know.  Like do your actual job.   We see through all this.   Down with the CFR!
Down with Russia 🇷🇺 and it’s dirty president 💩💩💩
May everyone be safe prayers to all in Ukraine 🇺🇦🙏
Vladimir Putin is the devil… horrible….this is disgusting ❌
What the heck is in that idiot's brain? What k8nd of positive outcome can he believe he can have? What an evil tyrant!!
i dont know why america and nato are concerned about war...they have always been the first ones to go to war against small countries. small or no millitaries..
We haven’t learnt anything since World War I. Sad…

I am from Israel and I very much understand the situation in Ukraine. We live this reality all the time ... My heart goes out to Ukraine.
PUTIN HAS A NEUROLOGICAL ISSUE -- HIS LEFT EYE IS DISPLAYING A SIGNIFICANT TIC -- A BRAIN TUMOR? A SEVERE NEUROLOGICAL INJURY? PLEASE INTERCESSORS CRY OUT FOR JUSTICE AND PROTECTION FOR YAH'S PEOPLE AND FOR JUDGMENT TO COME FROM FATHER'S COURTROOM. HIS REMNANT WILL BE SECURE IN HIM.
You kind of deserved it with the ethnic cleansing part.
He had no plans?  I guess he made new ones.
He got fed up with terrorism!?
Heart breaking,  I cannot believe we are facing further world instability after the past mentally, emotional and physical exhaustion from the world pandemic and here we are, business as usual . Seems the only peace on earth will be when we annihilate each other with nuclear war and we end up all losers on a radioactive cinder heap!
Russia go to hell☠
What if I tell you this was planned long time ago😳. Albert Pike's letter to Mazzini, written in August 15, 1871, clearly reveal three planned world wars and the outcomes. never ever think this is just a coincidence, it's part of the plan, they are pushing for a Great Reset, They call this decade(2021-2030) a 
Putin is heading down a black hole, and dragging his people with him. Yet again. Absolute power corrupts absolutely.  Putin  is a perfect example.  Hopefully the west exposes the true breadth of his warped corruption.
شام افغانستان ،کوسو کے انسانوں کے ساتھ کیا سلوک کیا تھا اب جنگ تمھارے دروازے پر پہنچ گئی ہے۔
Love Ukraine from Dubai
Putin will probably annex belurias if he takes Ukraine.
Так как же уже есть согласие на тайную атаку на Кремль?
Good thing we don’t have a President like Trump who kept this assclown at bay. Nah, we need a brain dead pedophile to ensure Russia slaughters millions. But hey, your social media isn’t mean anymore.
NATO needs to help Ukraine sanctions aren't gonna do anything
I can’t believe this
Sorry to people of Ukraine. This exactly how our family felt in Iraq
Putin is keeping it 55th street
When Israel bomb Syria because it feels threatened, No one of you cowards says anything. Now that Russia bombs Ukraine with genuine reasons, all of you cry like babies.If you keep quiet in Syria Israel bombing, then keep quiet Ukraine Russia bombing.
Whilst the rest of the democratic world have been steadily demilitarizing over the past 30yrs...Putin has been quietly expanding...the russian armed forces are massive...I mean MASSIVE.. this is going to make it difficult for Nato to even contemplate a strategy of defense...  I got this first hand from Russian, Latvian and Lithuanian friends and family.
They so want us to back UN and to be against Russia, when really the UN are trying to violate Russia and put in is just standing his ground. Put in and Ukraine were good then the Ukraine connect got killed? Hmmm then un want Ukraine to be apart of thier team ?  Alot of fake news going on and alot to discuss but that's the bottom line I belive based on what I've research. However I also belive that all world leaders are ultimately together , as the scripture says all world leader will unite when the antichrist arrives. Alot of agendas at play now to make this happen,  Mark of the beast and antichrist rising is getting nearer. Understand this. The word antichrist does not mean he is against christ.  The prefix anti was used differently in old English.  This person will literally be lucifer in the flesh literally , but he tries to counterfeit Jesus. Then everyone that actually knows Jesus born again children of God will say that is not God. Scripture says that the antichrist will decide the whole world and make a 1 word religion. But people that know the Lord Jesus will not be deceived neither shall they take the mark of the beast according to scripture. The mark or the beast also has a number that number is 666 that is name of the beast also. The bibles says this man will make everyone take the mark in their RIGHT hand or thier forehead. If anyone takes the mark they will go to hell garanteed.  So as you can clearly see there are preparing this with contact less etc forgot to mention the bible says no one will be able to buy or sell unless they take the mark. So contact less cashless society and now vacs etc etc hmmmm.  Now most important thing I want to write here is this. Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shall be saved, The moment you belive on Jesus as Lord and call on him you will be transformed by the Holy ghost. You will know him and you will be forgiven for your sins. John 3 16. Says   for God so loved the world that he sent his only Beggoton son that whosoever BELIEVETH in him should not perish but have everlasting life, so to connect with Jesus you have to put all your trust into what he done on the cross for you and call on him. Simple. He paid it with his blood all you have to do is believe.  Once you've believe you will know God for yourself and have full access to Him. At that point that's when you want to start doing his commands , going church , praying, reading, good deeds etc .   Not the other way round it wont work. Belive first (through research etc) once you know him then start your journey with him. I've known him 10 years and wow all I can say is I didnt know what love was until I met christ I didn't know what joy was etc etc His love is super He is super amazing,  but like every parent he will discipline his children,  however he is very patient and considerate and merciful ... very. As Paul said I am the chiefest of sinners, and maybe that's why I'm so passionate about telling people that God's ready to forgive and welcome you in. But on the flip slide if you reject christ , the harsh truth is eternal damnation and he'll fire. So it's a real choice you have to make for yourself. Do not get caught up in the matrix #lalaland.

 @Vase Break  and not only there
You think NATO has been demilitarising?
Russia twisted the facts and playing victim. So horrible
Ignorance is the root of all evil - Plato
😻
The Lord Jesus sees He will be with all people of this world we need to trust In his name..Ukraine call on Jesus he willll defend you
Ukraine is done for unless someone goes in militarily to stop Putin.  So, pretty much nothing will stop Putin from taking over Ukraine.  Sanctions will only go so far.  Tucker Carlson backs Putin and has backed him for years.
We have to put a stop to Putin...
What a despot,
putin the hitler, 20 year dictator
Thanks to nato rejection of Russian proposal
US and Nato to blame for this .
Stay strong Ukraine. We have experienced much horrific attacks in Syria:(
Did this really happen?
I hate seeing this,  I really hope everyone's okay this mist be so scary Ukraine ,
Ukraine Just Surrender everything will work out fine
May God save His people. Sorry dear brothers and sisters. Be strong. We are praying for you. From Kenya 🇰🇪
You Force  Russia do this British bulshit centre shame on you and you're haite against Russia.u haven't got respect for anything but your tuff talk.u supply Ucraina with arms and insult? and this is the result? your good.at provoking wars all over the world  and samoane to blame y!ou have no diplomatic missions shame .
😔
Gussa aur tufaaan dono shant hone ke baad hi pta chalta hai ki kitna nuksaan hua hai.
This is the result of the NATO Invasion and it is in the economic interest not for the safety of the citizens.
🇰🇪🇺🇦
God never saved anyone and religion has been used for war and discrimination. Your prayers do nothing to help except make you feel good about yourself.
 @NarrowFocus : ...Do you really have to tear into OP like that? Even if religion has been used for bad, not everyone who's religious goes around causing harm, and for some it's their motivation to do good.Unless you're doing something directly to help and it's genuinely useful, you're doing nothing to help either, your bringing it up only serves to put others down to make yourself feel better (I'm saying this as someone who isn't religious at all).
ukraine shouldnt allow foreign troops into its territory first.  They should know They cant count on it when things happen and only make themselves looks like clown
Time to step up world,enough is enough.
BBC propaganda as always
Wester propaganda: divide and conquer!
i love Russia
Fuck Putin! This filthy KGB swine belongs before an international tribunal. Until further notice: Only a dead Russian is a good Russian! Just as it was for Putin's role model Hitler and his Nazi people in 1939-45!
Ukrainian president really dropped the ball on this one
Stop lying, for eight years you have turned a blind eye to the killing of civilians in Donetsk, for thirty years you have been moving the borders of NATO to our country.
Fuck war.
Russia will now be more secluded than ever. Don’t know what person makes sanctioning calls but they do nothing as we have seen in mynamar and now. Am I a genius or stupid? Why not sanction all military officials, the president and people and things that matter and will make an impact. Sanctions all banks, block all Russians and don’t allow them in any country, don’t accept and oil and gas, cut off all money held around the world. Again this list will hit them hard but our politicians are sitting and coming up with useless sanctions that will only kill the poor, working class, innocent Ukrainians. Come on democratic countries. Use common sense or do you need the people to help as we pay big money in taxes to the government officials who creat the mess we are seeing all around the world.
Someone needs to take Putin out in such a way as to have plausible deniability.
Putins gotta die
Omg why  killing innocent people 🤦‍♀️This is so wrong
I am with russia
You believed him?  Y'all dumb AF
pronounced Kee... eve. Not Kiev. I hope Ukraine stays strong and fights on. And I hope militia volunteers from the west pours in to help them.
What a hypocrite devil
Self-defence?!
America sleeping
They should be driving on the opposite side of the freeway to get out
They always pull the anti nazification because they know it makes the people more patriotic. I was speaking to a Romanian today who said they were waiting for the Russians so some slavs want this to happen, but then America has surrounded them with weapons and now trying to get Russian neighbours to join nato so u can kind of understand them, but here in the west we don't get told about these things.
Russia 🇷🇺 has the right to defend itself and that includes Ukrainian territories. Ukraine lost its sovereignty the moment they overthrew a democratically elected government in 2014 and insisted to join NATO to threaten Russia's security. Pray for Russia 🇷🇺 🙏 accomplish its goals and feel safe again
A war requires military response. NATO is letting down Ukraine
word is that their air defenses and all the military airports are already gone....WOW what the actual ....f man.... rip to anyone involved :(
God bless Ukrainians!!! Stay strong hope help comes soon
Just surrender
of course Russia does not want another nato country next door
By killing ,Threatening ,intimidating innocent People what Russian win …
I am from Iraq, I support Russia, victory is yours 🇷🇺 🦅 🇮🇶 🔥
If everybody turn off the heating or set the temperature 2 degree down we use less gas, less money for terrorists
I know the feeling of Ukraine people because I am Rohingya refugee fled from Myanmar cruel military.
the russia goal is to gain access to europe 
Russcists  Will Be Punished!
If it escalates world will go to an ice age...who remember tsar bomba
Why can't they do the same thing they did to Gaddafi to Putin?
😢
Those jets looked like they were burning coal !🤔
POV: America 🛌
…what in the world?..
fake fact! why not talk the truth? who start this anger? nato mmber play victim to hide their mistakes! usa?france?Germany? where your ball? provoke russians, ask Ukrainian make a stupid statement to russians then you all run from there like a dog! coward country, just asking other to backup! nato suck! when their alliance invaded iraq and many more, no single  word fight for that! now want be a hero? ridiculous! stupid society!
America is a hypocrite, when was all this when sirya was invaded, when Libya was invaded, when Iraq, Afghanistan, Palestine, Yugoslavia. The list never ends. Hypocrisy.
From Ireland 🇮🇪 with love Ukrainian people and Russian people who care nothing for this war.
Go on Russia
Meanwhile healthcare workers are still fighting the battle against COVID in the hospitals. Now this in addition. Again, they can't stay at home - like many others, too.
Denazi  ? You are the nazi 🙄
Fake new
NATO  does nothing
I said to people that Putin would attack after the closing ceremonies of the Olympics
Shocked?, surprised?.., how naive are these people?. For weeks Russian soldiers encircling Ukraine, it was crystal clear what Putin was planning.., and reasoning with Putin? really?..
Dude is Trippin and we’re probably going to war. This truly sucks
Putin is an idiot, he will regret this
What is  Biden doing.. just meaningless words.modi should do something for ukraine.he has to talk with Putin
I cannot believe that I'm actually seeing this this does this is actually happening..😓😪😢🌏
Biden lets help Ukraine!
When the west going to put troops on the ground. Meet them head on
Please Stop War.
Where are the Ukrainian soldiers ?
in the border...

This is awful all my sympathy and prayers to the Ukrainian people, UN needs to help, God Bless you all 🙏,❤️ from Belfast UK 🌹🙏❤️
I love when he says “Russia cannot feel safe” while they’re the first ones to strike and start this scandal in the first place.
Support Russia from Pakistan 🇵🇰Fuck you west and america
I am totally against war in all its manifestations and I am sorry for Ukrainians, but I have a question: have you cried the same way for people in Afghanistan, Iraq, Serbia and many other countries?
How sad
When #isreal has the right of #self #Defence so does #Russia

 @Kendra  yes I do know what it's like ,was ten years old in 1968 when our home being attacked with bottles and bricks everynight for week's, until our parents could move family to another home. Many people died here, and I do understand death and destruction off life and homeland , don't need to read history to understand your point we grew up with it, I'll pray for all 🙏
Nothing's ever that simple.

 @Kendra  you're talking to the wrong person mate
It’s just an excuse to get what he wants 😕
Dirty Pack, f*ck you. You know you don't have the power to harm the west
There is no need to argue
Yes, I have. Everytime war came, including from the imperialist Americans and NATO, I was disgusted by it.
Yup. It’s a good point.
No, they haven’t. They think their band of thugs and thieves aka their government has some sort of moral high ground. They don’t understand the governments of the world are all thugs and killers. There’s no good guy. It’s thug vs thug and propaganda vs propaganda. They don’t see that.
 @King Of Clutch  the only one good guy died in 45 xD
Kiev isn’t in attack just far away
Putin wanted war now hes got it
Pray for Ukrainian
BBC IS PRO MUSLIM always praising Pakistan and wanted to lick there ass...I have seen it a lot ..

Oh Innocent civiliansInnocent childs 😭Womens Aged peopleI m really worried about themPlz stop this war
I love when he says “Russia cannot feel safe” while they’re the first ones to strike and start this scandal in the first place.
Wow, humans didnt really learn from previous events
Oh no! Prayers go out to the Ukrainian civilians ❤
Ukraine, just pay 900 billion for 1 atomic bom, common USA sell it. That is it.
For everything must be a reason or reasons... coincidence basically doesn’t exist. (...in this case certainly not). So, what are the real reasons or issues?War happens in few reasons: -when both sides seem to be right about extreme conflict;-when there’s unstoppable will for revenge stronger than will for life;-when you’re driven into war according to previous crimes against humanity or war actions;... it all triggers “chain-reactions” which is a bit dangerous already at this point...(nobody in the world can take responsibility for deaths and murders unless they have extremely important and proven reasons... even the “monsters” simply can’t do that, that’s not in the people’s nature). Of course, all that is not the desired solution. But, as a last resort, it happens.*Personally, I quite understand the “cause and effect” leading to seriously dangerous situations having the unfortunate tragedy of experiencing crime against humanity from my own country and people that is part of the developed nato-world and certainly can think about similarly bad or worse situation there with larger number of situations, people and less developed part of the world. Yeah, I have graduated from two different faculties and exceptionally good worked in three different working fields to be unfairly pushed out of everything politically, socially abused and falsely proclaimed as mentally ill person in order to defend all that criminal activities from authorities towards me. ...of course, decided to take matters lawfully to get compensation for all (which is not easy, and gets only to more absurdly unfair behavior from authorities, society and government). & yeah, something has got to be done... before it’s too late.
It's lesson for Ukraine in response to Donbass where 14000 people died
Both countries are responsible for this situation Russia creating a buffer zone for himself & Ukraine wants to join NATO (USA) .It's only benefiting to US bcoz USA is the biggest arms exporter to the world. Be aware from US (wolf under sheeps skin)USA also did the same thing in Cuban missile crisis & i bet nobody is coming to help except Bharat(india).
My thoughts and prayers out to the Ukraine may the people be at peace❤️
Ok lits go....where's is nato game play

A bit naive the Ukrainians to be calm. Putin wants the motherland. If it become European a lot of non European would try to migrate into Ukraine and I know from Ukranian and Russian friends living in the UK they  would never allow non white to mix with them. Hence Putin is preventing Ukraine to end like the UK with black minorities or muslim etc. And under the hands of Americans, never.
Reminds me of 2003 if you know what I mean

They aren't even talking about Pakistan, now shoo Indian bot.
The whole scandal didn't start today. It continues for 8 years or even more. Firce fights are terrible and war is surely unnecessary, but let away the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. It's too complicated to call one country 
He's crazy, everything he says is bullshit. But what I like is that no one can stop him. Unbelievable!
He meant NATO
Just typical soviet lies and propaganda
 @Anet ttt  Yeah... Nato is useless.  They think sanctions could stop that wacko...lol.

Fuck nato fuck u.s. You push Russia to do this. Nato wants ukraine join nato and expect Putin to watch?Putin act to prptect their interest too
 @Viktor Svetlov  let's judge the man for his actions - 40 civilians have already been killed.
 @Edic Cartman  My uncle lives in Lugansk, I know a little more than you. Do you think in 8 years, Ukraine has not killed anyone there ... but we, under Putin, also do not live sweetly, but he is NOT a TYRANT and NOT a KILLER !!!Yes, war is always victims, an entire crew died an hour ago due to equipment failure, we also have losses, someone's families were left without fathers ... we don't want war, we are a peaceful people !!!
 @Viktor Svetlov  yeah I don't idealize Ukrainians, and still its president didn't come to Bryansk or Rostov , to make there Ukrainian enclave. Nobody can say clearly why Russia needs Ukraine back ( I think by now not even Putin's most devoted fans ). It's all about stupid imperialistic ambitions , Russian leaders were always full of
 @Edic Cartman  Ask NATO...
 @Viktor Svetlov  I don't think I need their help, cz I know myself, they will never start the war with nuclear superpower. It costs a lot of money  and casualties ( and unlike our countries, they do care of their soldiers' lives ). We've been hearing the same narrative  for at least 100 years, when Lenin said , Russia will be forced to run the war with capitalists in the nearest future . And we'll fight till the last one falls.Same shEEt , different day. What's sad is that ordinary people get screwed up cz of ambitions of politicians from both sides.
 @Edic Cartman  This is all very sad... ;(
 @Backyard Retreat  I think that NATO is still trying to solve this problem without fire, but if Putin does not stop, then NATO will no longer have a choice, and real world war will probably begin.
 @Anet ttt  By the time NATO finish procrastinating, it's too late for Ukraine.
You can say that again!

😭😭😭😭😭heart breaking
This is what you get when you bring your neighbours enemies to its borders. Wonder if U.S would allow Russian military bases in Mexico 🇲🇽 🙄 😒
Why…..
No mention of the U.S. backed Fascists then?
Go Ahead Putin , I support Russian.  Russia has a right to protect their people.  US and some West country  stop their dangerous IDEAs
Russia bombed civilians in Syria and no one talked about it.
Sine hundreds of years the same plot: Western fascist monarchies provoke and local people are suffering. All this hand in hand with system media such as BBC. It is time to wake up, there is mo such thing as democracy... all an illusion.
To bad Biden was there to stop it 🤣
War isn't welcon. As a Bangladeshi , we know what's a horrible matter.
I wish luck and commitment and glory to all those who remained and decided to fight!viva la ukryina!!
BBC pushing war.  The leaders of our countries are the reason this is happening
Russians have been allowed by the world to bomb syrian civilians now for over a decade... This had to happen. Russia is emboldened. The world will pay the price for being silent spectators in syrian massacre by bashar putin khomaeini nexus.
That idiot Putin should stop this shit
That airport was the military base
Now just hope minimum casualties of Ukraine and Russia rRussia will take what they want and what they should have
F*ck whoever starts a war without thinking about the people who get affected by it
But it is the civilians, not the men that give the orders, that will die to War. Like always. That's why it's so horrible.
How is bombing civilians protecting people? Serious question.
Not @ Civilian , Bombing @ Military's command area and Infrustructure

This is devastating.
Ukraine hypocrisy...wanted to join Nato
Fuck shit fuck shit fuck shit Taiwan is going to be next by china
It so strange to see fake video like this, it so strange that people around the world think that Russia is aggressor when it is evident that everywhere USA touch happens war.
May have PEACE Ukraine
Normal day in Iraq and Afghanistan 😁
I always wonder why as humans always fight amongest themselves,why? Just because of borders and power? We are all humans whether black, white, indian no matter the language we speak. The common enemy is diseases and poverty but countries spend trillions on weapons to kill fellow humans while some humans die of hunger and live in poverty. This is the world we are in, power is more important than human life. I just wish i was not born in this generation, everything is complicated.
How do I know this is not old video footage  that has been reedited to attempt to demonise  Russian in my mind. Don't trust the TV People. They  lie to try and manipulate your opinoins. Do you own research and repeat nothing the TV say's     (    ;
Metro 2033 about to become a real thing soon lmao 🤣
UK is hiding behind NATO 😂😂😂😂
If you were power 🔋 full just like Russian  no country will dare 😤 to say anything to you
I know the feeling of waking up the morning without safety anymore. I didn’t realize being safe is that much important in our lives. I am from Myanmar and the invasion from Russia and our country current military coup is different but I know the feeling of uneasiness. Lining up for ATM, leaving your home and wondering and wishing someone is gonna save us. Be strong Ukrainians.
well they didn't care about putin's demands for not joining NATO and now they get what they deserve...sad innocent people will have to suffer but it is because the dumb leaders of the west and ukraine
Just remember when words like 
I would wish someone bomb putin office
Vladimir, Russia has been consecrated to the Immaculate Heart of Mary, the mother of Jesus Christ. Your legacy should be as a peaceful, loving leader!I pray that this senseless invasion come to an end promptly, God willing.🙏🙏🙏✝️

Send in some Drones to Moocow  shoot Putin
May Putin and his cronies burn for all the suffering they've brought to Ukraine. God help Ukraine and it's people, I wish them nothing but the best
history is repeating itself and it shows 😕 may God be with everyone ❤
Unfortunately, no. China doesn't use the same diplomatic and military tactics as Russia. China' strategy is one mainly focused on soft power, aka expanding economic influence. They do this by joining trade blocs and making trade deals. This is even mimicked by China's military, which now has a large navy capable of enacting naval blockades, and is the largest in the world. This is not a military tactic, but rather a diplomatic and economic one. By having the largest navy in the world, you can blockade nations that refuse to trade with you, which is what China wants to do. This different line of thinking leads to China focusing on trying to improve relations with Taiwan, and if it doesn't work in the end they can just blockade them until they agree to trade. Russia however, thinks in mostly military and hard power terms. Economic dependency, invasion, blockades to cripple war efforts, etc. It's all hard power tactics. This is why Russia invaded Ukraine instead of improving relations or whatever. It uses mainly its' military, and it's not hard to see why. It is so vast and powerful military wise, and backed up by the largest global stockpile of nukes.So no, China will not invade Taiwan. China thinks so differently from Russia that it's like they're living in different worlds. So don't expect invasion, but if Taiwan is too stubborn for China, expect a harsh economic blockade.

These Russian comments are filled with hatred for what reason? Hope Ukraine do not surrender and fight to the last minute.
 @ты гей если ты это читаешь  so should russia. Fuck russia you communists
 @ты гей если ты это читаешь  As should you obviously
 @ты гей если ты это читаешь  Russia will wipe anyone from the face of the earth for Ukraine. These are our brothers. They begged Putin to protect them from Nazism and Western power, soon they will get it. Everything is fine, peaceful people will hardly suffer.
Trg https://youtu.be/VDu3w1DqGhw
 @DarLav  it's only a matter of time before Ukraine is once again russian
 @SkyPrince  You seem confuse. Is Russia who is invading Ukraine, not the contrary my friend.
 @ты гей если ты это читаешь  The occupation of Ukraine is gonna be an open wound to Russia, more so that what was Chechenia even. And then, economic sanctions. This is just the last move of an elder man that wants to have a legacy, doesn't matter how many russians die for him.
 @Kendra  you are essentially implying, that the world is Russia's house, metaphorically.This statement says a lot about the expansive, imperialistic Russian ideology. Absolutely repugnant.
Churchill and General Patton were correct on wanting to confront the Soviet Union after WW2, the knew just like after WW 1 the unfinished business would come back to hunt us in the future and Russia has been a problem ever since!
 @Forastero  Russia had no choice, all of eastern Ukraine Begged Putin to put an end to Nazism and Nazi power. And the Ukrainian army has been killing children in Donbas for 8 years. NATO has shown complete futility in resolving these issues. We forced Putin to bring in troops.
 @Forastero  yes, that is probable.
 @ты гей если ты это читаешь  you menace. You enemy of freedom.rIt is grotesque, that Putin's arbitrarity and absuridity finds a platform within the naivity and ignorance of yours. rI hope people like you represent an intellectual minority in the Russian demography because of their absolute obtuseness and inanity.
 @DarLav  i think these profiles are FSB comments and ex KGB comments , I believe the russian people don't war I also think that just like ukranians now many russians would want the russian regime to fall and a west oriented democratic governement to be established in russia , I think that's the only way ukraine and russia can become friends again I hope putin's regime would fall soon either by a surgical strike , or a revolution in russia though it's unlikely unfortunetly so that eastern europe and russia itself would stop being a hostage to putin's pride and whims
 @Tee Money Travels  well Russia was always a powerful country at least in it's sphere of influence , that being said yes a west intervention early before the soviet union was established might have meant a more democratic and pro western Russia  , world 2 itself might have been won much earlier if a tighter alliance between russia uk and france was established before world war 2 instead of staline's rapprochement with the nazi's when they split Poland like a cake between themselves
 @SkyPrince  and how does kiev and Lviv and odessa work into that ?!! fact is Russia intervened for geostrategic reasons and security reasons for russia yes , I might even agree that the threat of NATO establishing bases in Ukraine was real , but it doesn't justify a full scale invasion , just like nothing justified the invasion of USA to iraq or Afghanistan , nothing justifies destroying Ukraine , nothing justifies that ukranians loose their ability to go to their jobs and schools to relax and enjoy life just because putin ( not russians , just putin and his thugs ) feel threatened , if it was a majority decision of russians I think putin wouldn't feel threatened by the lone protests who are silent with a simple writing of solidarity with ukraine , these are russians who are arrested and their freedom taken just like russia wants to do to ukraine  I agree with president Zelensky there is a new Iron curtain drawn in Russia that wants to eat Ukraine inside as well !!!
 @Aissam AFIFI  And I'll tell you too:1. Ukrainians have internet2. There are millions of phones in Kiev and Odessa3. There is not a single video of an attack on these cities from the phone!Do you really believe everything they say on the news? All news must be checked!

Why don't US do anything?
I'm afraid this war will be escalated into WW3.
Nato should have retreated the weapons around Russia
there are many neo NAZIS-skinheads in Russia too, putin is NEW RUSSIAN HITLER!
Russia cannot feel safe develop and exist with constant threat emanating from the territory of modern Ukraine. EXACTLY..  this is a threat to their national security.  Remember Cuban Missile Crisis, USA was to invade CUBA for siding with Soviet.  For the sake of humanity, hypocrites NATO and USA leave Ukraine alone and Ukraine renounce NATO to stop this war.
I can't imagine how these people are getting by with so much destruction and death around them. I'm sending prayers and I'm watching from a far.
I wan’t you to know the people that was calling this WAR Fake y’all are bunch of cowards n a disgrace to the world bunch of people lost n the world 🤦‍♂️🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 innocent people dying.
War is not the solution to any problem. The world powers should adopt the best wisdom in this situation😭
Putin sees United States as weak after a Trump presidency.  He sees democracy as a failure.  Authoritarianism is what he wants to keep himself and wealthy oligarchs in power.  The United States should stop the export of Russian goods and this means stopping oil from Russia being sold on open works  market. Hurt the oligarchs in their pockets and they will convince Putin this is a dumb idea.  That means freezing oligarchs bank accounts in U.S. and kicking them out of US and seizing their properties.  Trump sold a lot of his properties to Russians.  Putin sees America as weak because of Trump.  Biden needs to get tough and send US troops to aid Ukraine at borders.  Ukraine does not deserve to be abandoned because of fear of war with Russia.  We are already there as Russia has no intention of stopping in Ukraine.
Normal people (middle to low classes) died, animals died. More will die and they will manipulate the numbers. Watching normal everyday human beings and domestic animals deal with greed of the worlds elite is sickening. They sit behind a desk, rich, and egocentric and declare war as humans on all sides put their lives on the line. All during a pandemic..
Support to Putin.......love from india
#FAkeNews propaganda... not even high production value. At least get a good camera out for the cityscapes you use as greenscreen backdrops.
Putin looks delusional
Look for the US in this whole horrible conflict. Americans want to surround Russia by having Ukraine join the NATO. Russia is angry. Who pays the price? People on both sides of the conflict. Who stands from far away and plays innocent and in support of the poor people? The effinnn' Americans...
This is a White House  and Cremlin  wars on the Territory of Ukrane...
I can't believe I'm watching this
Watch 
You think your prayers help?
This is not an invasion, but the disarmament of the criminal, fascist army of Ukraine, the Russian military does not touch civilians! Ukrainian criminals have been killing residents of Donbass for eight years...
Viet nam🙏🙏🙏❄️❄️😩😩🇺🇸
You we’re all warned yet you choose to ignore
whoever shells civilians is evil. Prayers to Ukraine and the innocent people caught in the crossfire. 🙏🙏🙏
Like she said,The Russian people dont vote for this i feel like this has to happen to end this dictature in Russia so the actual Russians can vote for what they want like there supposed to.
Please support Russia and Putin against the stupidity of NATO
So the United Nations is a joke
Has anyone tried waving rainbow flags and providing gender studies for the russian army??? Maybe they just need a hug...
Bias news .    What nato did..support to Putin from India
End of the word is coming ..
I just can't imagine 💔 my eyes are fill with water...my body has chill bumps..😭...no one..no country deserve this ..why can't it stop

Has there been confirmation of civilians being killed? Strikes on power grids and infrastructure as well as command and control points is normal. The United States does this all over the world...

 @Jared Weiman  i found a report that about 15 were killed so far. so for this scale of war it is basically zero. with so much ammo shot it is weird so little missfires happened.
You don't care about the eastern part of Ukraine for 8 years.
You need to get ye facts together US the UK have killed millions over the last 20 years.
 @daniel gimenez  don't assume we didn't say anything because I for one did.
 @daniel gimenez  You mean that Syrian army that Bashar used to slaughter the Syrian people? His own people. And with the help of Vladimir. Add Kim to the trio and you have three greatest cowards in the world.
 @daniel gimenez  Russia is also hitting civilian targets
 @Josey Stranded  exactly. Putin killed his own people in Chechnya
 @lunabranwen  Не несите ЧУШЬ !!!
 @ทอมมี่  can you give direct sources on that?
Lol like the middle east were not human beings. #CollateralDamage
It ain't no Utopia he will strike anyone. 🙏🏽 #Ukraine https://youtu.be/OAaZRJ8_9rQ
that russian woman is an idiot. talking about its biden invading..smh
 @Viktor Svetlov  ❤️🕊️🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
when ukrainans shelled a kindergarden a fashist ukranian battalion aidar?
 @daniel gimenez  “damn weak brains”…. Ironic
That's every country. Especially USA.
 @daniel gimenez  a hundred wrongs don't make a right. Those attacks were wrong but this is wrong too.
 @Sheik Farhad  white lives matter.
 @Matjaž Teran  15 too much
Russia says :Surgical Strikes on military instalations only.
 @Vinod Ramachandran  more importantly all lives matter and poetic verses like your comment encourages me to place more bets on Russia and wishes that the damages are far bigger than the collateral caused in the middle east who did not deserve that evil punishment
Where were you when the new installed Ukrainian regime sent in Ukrainian troops to attack Eastern-Ukraine? The Russians are only bombing selective military targets and ammo depot that could be used to rearm the Ukrainian military for more invasion into Eastern-Ukraine in an attempt to recapture the break away regions and to reabsorb into their control. I believe Mr. Putin will pull back once he fully disarms the Ukrainian military.
 @Sheik Farhad  yup but it takes war in Europe for the west to open their eyes to the horrors of war.
 @Nes Ta  i agree, but still i am talking stastistically.
 @Sheik Farhad  An eye for an eye will make the whole world blind - Mahatma Gandhi
 @Sheik Farhad  if at all you want someone to suffer  wish it upon  the perpetrators, why Poor Ukraine. They've got nothing to do with the Middle East.
 @Josey Stranded  Well said bud...
 @Vinod Ramachandran  taste what's to come around. #karma
 @Matjaž Teran  I understand what you mean. I was hoping there wouldn't be any casualties. Aren't they supposed to attack military buildings and bases only?
Russia killed at least 3 Ukraine soldiers on their homeland on the border at 5am in  the darkness
 @Nes Ta  yes that is the plan. But the problem is usually malfuncion of ammunition (rounds fall short or off course) or some civilian runs twards an army collumn for help and gets mowed down since he doesn't stop for orders... missinformation is a huge factor sometimes and so on. It is still more reliable than 30 years ago but it happens.
You mean how the US and NATO have purposely bombed civilian targets for years?
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
So that’s every politician that’s ever been involved in a war
 @daniel gimenez  get over it pussy
 @daniel gimenez  Plenty of people spoke up you stupid fuck.
 @daniel gimenez  don't know about you, but i can see a difference or 2 (between Ukraine and Syria)
 @Viktor Svetlov  ,🤣
 @daniel gimenez  it's double standard of American
 @Matjaž Teran  15? You know how many killed the first day of war in Iraq?
 @Jared Weiman  yes, there are videos on twitter of a guy on a bike getting shelled and killed.
 @Jared Weiman  forty civilians including a child. Do you honestly think you can drop bombs and not kill people? How brainwashed are you?
For US, Russia, EU bombing civilians are like a walk in park ..... Sadly
 @daniel gimenez  the syrain army bombed hosptials and used chemical weapons...
 @daniel gimenez  
 @JoJo  Biden is responsible for this bud
Maybe you should have a chat with the US, UK & NATO about that, they have murdered far more civilians than Russia !
 @Ballin With Kicks  that was the terrorist group called the White Helmets . Sponcered by the US . Too bad you are not following all news channel , otherwise you'll know the truth .
 @IAM HARDWELL  probably more than a few.
@Michael Johnson, taking out a US sponsored Nazi regime that has been killing Russians in Eastern Ukraine may be the only option available.I agree that shelling civilians is evil. Does that not make US the most evil criminal in the past 75 years?
 @Jared Weiman  No, the US also targets innocent civilian women and children. But I get your point.
 @FactsMatter  great response 👍👍
Sad reality is that... USA and NATO is not that powerful anymore... Bye bye to USA and NATO... If there is no actions done by USA or NATO... No other countries will have to will to belive your support in future... Wish TRUMP was the President.. He would have done something... Next is that... If today is Ukraine.. Next is Taiwan... Etc etc it will go on
My heart goes out to the women and children. 🤴🏼👸🏻
Western sanctions is kind of sissy. We should demand Germany to cancel Nordstream 1 and cut all trade and financing to and from Russia. Any country who buys Russian gas will be banned to trade in Europe and the US. Time to go Ronald Reagan on Putin.
This horror is stated by the west and if you want to know the president of Ukraine is a puppet of the United States
USA is responsible for all this....
Brits and Americans will fight Russians untill last Ukrainian
This is day 1....But what abt Syria constantly being bombed by Russians.....May almighty liberate Syria...And give strength to people of Palestine and Ukraine...
Amercia NATO and Europ countries are responsible not Russia
I know how they fealing. I'm from Serbia, and at 99 NATO destroyed civilians all over the Serbia... This is terrible
If Russia was an Islamic country, they would call it theorist.
Idk why putin is saying it was self defense like bro ur military is bigger calm down war is not needed today, it’s really dumb
This shit has me Pissed to no end. The Russian government has to fall.
Bravo Zelinsky‼️ Waking up in broad daylight, dreaming of becoming a super big superman, shouting loudly to challenge neighboring countries. When the challenge is met, Zelinsky first runs away to save himself, leaving his people to die ️‼️Bravo Zelinsky ✔️You are a VERY AMATEUR AND DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO POLITICS ️ 😂Good thing Zelinsky wasn't born leader of Cuba, 24 Hours America will finish you off, if the NEUTRAL AGREEMENT WITHOUT MILITARY BASE breaks the treaty to BIG BEAR AMERICA😂🤣🐻
THE DOMINO EFFECT OF THE AFGHANISTAN WITHDRAWAL. THIS IS THE INCOMPETENCE OF BIDEN AND HIS ADMINISTRATION THAT LEAD TO THIS.
All of this while our gutless wonder does nothing
Ukraine is no match for the government military. They are at the mercy of totalitarianism.
The only people suffering are innocent people
SAY NO TO WAR 🙏🙏🙏
The United States and Europe pushed Putin into this.
To EVERYONE in Ukraine!!
My Solute to H.E. Mr Putin, hope NATO terrorism ends
Ukraine 🇺🇦 should go after Poison Killer little Putin himself Watch 
Putin is a psychopath. Defense? Ukraine wasn’t a threat.
It is the rights of Russia to do everything thing against western countries which try to destroy the Russia
My comments will probably be taken down because it is the truth
Where are real videos of war you pathetic journalists.
i always hated russia, now i have a reason at least to right me 💀 f@ck them
Puttin please stop that
Thank America they took out Porashenko in 2014 and installed this clown. Why because America and Europe want to destabilise Russia.
World War 3 is on its way...prayers to the families lost !!!
O my how scary , bidden may talk.See how afraid(0).Sanctions?Against multi billionaires ?
This is possibly one of the most important and most iconic news pieces the BBC has ever produced. In future, you're going to see clips from this very news report used in documentaries, etc.
BBC friends in commie lands have turned out to be wrong uns
PUTIN LIES

Terrorism
Thank you for your reporting
Wtf is wrong with these leaders man where is the sense in killing one another !! Come on putin go enjoy your life and riches wtf you gotta  prove
Oh the lack of empathy...
This is not an invasion, but the disarmament of the criminal, fascist army of Ukraine, the Russian military does not touch civilians! Ukrainian criminals have been killing residents of Donbass for eight years...
NATO must strike before it is too late
The USA has been able to help 🙌 the USA 🇺🇸 ♥ 😍  Russian and other countries that can
Reporter asking public what they think of Biden's leadership. RESPONSE: 
America is a bunch of traitors.  Stay with Ukraine
Hey guys.  The 
Rush BVladimir Putin
God have mercy
I wish for civilians to be safe, but Zelensky's Nazi regime must go out of the Ukraine.
All you democrats who planted Biden in the WH are to blame for this.
Американ сепаратист...гоу хом домой...
so, are there no plans for retaliation by the west?
How the fuck can they say they are defending themselves when no one made any act of serious aggression towards them and they are killing civilians. Surely if it was self defence you would go for the people fighting back posing an actual risk to soldiers rather than families in their homes
Defending white Christian Europe from... wait
That guy was fleeing the war in a mustang gt500 😱
Escape from ukraine cough cough tarkov
My cousin Lives in Ukraine 😭😭😭 I’m only 9
Praying for them
This is sick to make up these reasons to attack these poor innocent people. It is just heartbreaking. 😞
Russia killing innocent people…..they are acting like children with all this war stuff 🤦🏼‍♂️ heartbreaking that the leaders of the world still believe that killing each other solves problems.
Why are the woke commies not marching in the streets, waving flags & attacking our police in protest against Russia invading Ukraine?. Funny how Corbyn & his brother are not protesting with their commie mob isn't it.?. If this was UK or USA invading another country, they would soon be marching on parliament.
Romans 10:99 because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
aliens that are watching us rn: ''look at these dirty primitive monkeys bombing each other, we've never observed such immense hatred and hunger for power in any other species before''
stay strong Ukraine...I hope this one will pass too!
Because of one person ego poor young soldiers dieng in fight. Political leaders should go for fight
Wiley sounds like Hitler again
Does russians besides putin even care about Ukraine?
Out of the Spanish flu into ww2,  invading a country from a nearby country,
Changed my mind about Putin. He IS a fool. A BIG fool. And the Biden administration is partly to blame. My guess this never would have happened with a competent US president. . . And journalists stop with KEEEV. It's clearly a TWO SYLLABLE name.
Ukraine needs to destroy bridges and roads as Russia is just using them for their tanks to quickly get to Kyiv and other cities
My cousin lives in Ukraine  😭😭😭 I’m only 10
Anger begins in folly and Ends in repentance 😄
Stay strong Ukraine, sending prays.
Hello Russians this is very wrong. Pls stop the war & withdraw your troops
Prayer for all human involved in this. War is not the answer. 😢
RAF will take over the skies by 12am
I think someone must bring a swift end to dictator Putins career.
Russia is destroying all the US weapons caches. LOL. Go Russia.
Western Propaganda 🤦🏾‍♂️Down with Fascist Neo Nazi Ukrainian state 🇨🇦❤️🇷🇺
fake orchestrated western media.. the westerns did this to the Ukrainian people...
Blame sleepy Joe biden and his expansionist policy
That'd be nice to see. Let's get the angry disagreeable old men we love to elect in the ring and see if they're as eager to initiate violence when it's their necks instead of the lives of pure innocents at risk.
8 лет назад надо было со всем эти закончить.. Верили Украине, что мирным путем договорятся..
Не спеши, вояка.. А то может по мелкобритании прилететь.. Смешные такие..
Pretty sure the Western Media doesn't have missiles they launch at civilians. Don't try to confuse yourself out of what's actually happening: Missiles launched at innocent civilians.... MISSILES LAUNCHED AT INNOCENT CIVILIANS. We need to stop killing each other.
never expected Imran Kahn to turn up in Moscow did you ....... now you know that the man who threw the US out of Afghanistan is with the denazifiers .  Saudi Arabia suddenly makes diplomatic overtures to Iran ? US must be shitting themselves . England had better be careful and Sturgeon better shut her mouth .
Now they gonna listen to what Russia is saying, nato go back to your place where you were in 1997
'Snarling
Russia is not doing this in self defense
Пусть будет дружба а не война
Russia and Trump killing Ukraine
congrats Russia and Putin
Если это не повод лишить суверенитета и независимости не до империю 
I feel so sorry to the people of Ukraine. This is not looking good!!!
What is wrong with Russian!?
My heart goes out for all the people in Ukraine 😭 ... sending love and prayers 🇯🇲
Humans will never ever learn, always making the same mistakes. Honestly, and we call ourselves homo sapiens sapiens...
Make no mistake we are at War!, we are not left we are not right we are the bottom and we are coming for you at the top !!!. Follow the mooney its time to stop paying tax stop voting , dismiss government and reinstate Common Law no victim no crime . This will free up trade and stop monopolies giving us freedom
Self defense this guy is crazy
The video doesn't actually show what the reporter is saying. BBC BS again. I'm never trusting them again after their covid lies
The 1980s all over again
And USA and England didnt drop bombs on Iraq, Avganistan, Syria, Vietnam, Yugoslavia... Thay drop candy and red baloons....
Putin is gay.
CLOWNTIME IS OVER. Decapitate the CIA snake in its nest. Go Russia!
As an Indian I am going to stay neutral because of the how much russia has helped us historically
Якби я був прем’єр-міністром, то незабаром би ввів жорсткі санкції проти Росії, але Японія зараз цього не робить. Я був дуже розчарований. Дуже боляче, що я можу лише побажати твого спокою.

Jah know
they did exactly same to russian ethnic back then. they shooting rocket and guided missile to civilian. now russia against back what they do in the past.
What about the Jamakans that support putins actions like on RT news youtube comments?
Slava ruska
Care about black This war is between white people
 @Noogle Noodle  what year was that
 @Tasslar  Jamaicans*
 @Adnan Adan  Slava ruska
 @Diorzim Gaming  u are a shameless  worthless human being.They are HUMANS u fool😡😑
 @Danny Slater  you can ask soros and biden sons for that. when they plan to do that and why they attacking russians ethnicity in ukrainian 😁🤣👌.look how youtube delete all war crime video record done by nato jet and this kyiv regime who use us fund support. shooting guided missile to civilian public building car and last to the kindergarten toke hundred kids life just for sake american dream they said 👍.typical american deception to play victim.now they leader putin. answered you and challenge american and eu. 🤣this is far for what they called it as invasion. this situation is like a thug came to your house take your family as captive then you called by a judge as a criminal because you fight thug who attacking your families inside your own property.let see. this becoming funny because kyiv citizens them self know this better, even Ukrainian soldier put down their weapon already.where those politician who use poison word now? hide?I believe their destiny already made by Merkel. they will continue their life as to be a delivery boy like afghan vice president. 😁🤣👌ride a bike delivering pizza 😁🤣👌 green energy to 🤣
So u have been  basically  purchased
 @Derrick Iqbal  russia did not help us with money, they helped us with battleships when US and UK were helping Pakistan and they also helped us in military by joint military  research. Being grateful to someone  is not same as selling yourself
 @Arun  does that gratitude supersede world peace?Ps. Im up for a civilized argument if you have something sensible to say
 @Derrick Iqbal  for me yes because what will I do with world peace if my country is defeated in a war against our arch rivals, US and UK battleships were literally bombing our coastal areas before russia came to help
 @Arun  that was in the past, we are talking about the current world and its peace right now
Putin really thinks if takes Ukraine fast enough that there won't be any consequences for him and Russia.
fascism will be destroyed in Ukraine...AZOV...Bandera....
What about UNO? Sleeping?
Ukraine paying for harassing Russia by trying to join NATO
please putin no more hit on ukrain
its all creepy joe bidens fault!
Every person better be praying that another World war won’t break out. With all the nuclear weapons, it would be world ending.
It is illegal for Russia to invade and occupy Ukraine but it is completely legal and fine to invade and occupy West Bank and Golan heights by Israel as it is self defense !FUCK YOU UNCLE SAM AND UR BLOODY HYPOCRISY !GO RUSSIA AND FUCK USA AND IT'S ALLIES 😍😍😍 !
horrible scene😬
Why didn't Ukraine prepare more....
I curse Putin and Russian soldiers!! They are all devils when the world is still being hurt by the pandemic. What has Ukraine done wrong, just unfortunate being a neighbouring country to evil Russia? Ukraine please teach Putin and his gang a lesson!
Russian fight with themselves
Why dont we force zelinsky and putin to a cage fight... why dont we remove the politics and speakers and just make the two men duke it out in the ring.. who ever loses loses his position with their country.... end
Ukraine people are the bravest, they are ready to stay and die for the country just to put up a fight 🙌❤️
Blood is on your Shoulders; Stinking putin !!
Im a hungarian person were so scared that what is gonna happen.. We hope there will be no ww3 and my bff's parents are ukrajne and i love them.. I hope they can survive, 🥰😣😞💋❤️
Financially paralyze putins inner circle and seize all their foreign assets!
World war 3
Ukraine demanded that, in exchange for nuclear disarmament, it would need ironclad security guarantees. That was  the heart of the agreement signed in Moscow early in 1994 by Russia, Ukraine and the United States.In late 1994, the pledges got fleshed out. The accord, known as the Budapest Memorandum, signed by Russia, Ukraine, Britain and the United States, promised that none of the nations would use force or threats against Ukraine and all would respect its sovereignty and existing borders. The agreement also vowed that, if aggression took place, the signatories would seek immediate action from the United Nations Security Council to aid Ukraine.
So tell me putin, how is it self defense when your army is killing innocent Ukrainian citizens?
Absolutely! I am praying! It's very dark and scary times for all of us. Wishing you all the best, we are all (all of us worldwide) in this together.
💯
Lol not true Russia already took some of their country in 2014 and they did nothing
Russia is forced to turn to China now for trade. Gonna be catastrophic for Russian foreign policy to be lapdogs to china. Thats a goodbye to russian domination in eastern russia, especially vladivostok region. And central asia will be chinas backyard now, not russian. And their economy will suffer greatly, i see putin already warning againt strong sanctions. Hes deluded now, tried to pull a Hitler in 2022. This will only be chaos, and no russian benefit at all.
Is it really that difficult to let people live peacefully??
It’s Americas fault the peace in Europe is getting destroyed Russia only protected themself from the Ukrainians who got weapons form US. as well as America who spread fear the Russia would attack when Russia even said they wouldn’t. It’s like the history have told us, where Americans put their soldiers it becomes war. This was something that could easily be fixed without America destroying it all.
Residents of Ukraine living in Donbas and Luhansk were killed by Ukrainian nationalists for 8 years. Watch videos on the Internet from the funeral of children and civilians. They were killed only because they did not want the new power that came with the help of the coup d'état organized by the USA. I hope that Putin will end this war, which has been going on for eight years, in a few days. And Ukrainian residents will live in peace, as it was before the USA intervention.
I am from Sri Lanka I know how they feel about the war. Because we lived with war 30 years.I wish this war  will be able to finish as soon as possible
So senseless, so sad, and just because mainly one person in Russia thinks he has the right to do anything, wants power above all else and does not notice how senseless we all think this is!My heart goes to anyone, everyone who is suffering right now due to this terrible war situation!
Putnochio lied about not invading Ukraine. Imagine that.
no wonder putin gets on so well w/ trump 🤯...
Jesus is the answer
Who all want Putin to burn in hell?
The sound of the sirens are so haunting,every time I hear them in films or where ever I just feel like crying for all those wasted mens lives ,losing their lives because of control freaks,how do you tell your babies of this madness,people have a right to peace and live without fear.we vote for these lunatic’s,but I’m sure no one wanted a war,lading to ww3 .this needs stopping now and Boris needs to keep his mouth shut about all these sanctions on Russia,because Russia will return the favour and keep fuel from us and more,so shut up Boris,you are not Winston Churchill  ,Europe does not need a war and neither does Ukraine nor the normal Russian only the people we vote for seem to want it.
Zelenskyy and Putin are both Chabad. This is a Purim sacrifice offering.
Putin is the biggest liar in the world!!! He has no mercy of whomever or whatever. Innocent people are getting killed by his own ambitious...
This happen only for NATO. USA please stop the false promises. In Ukraine lots of innocent peoples died for NATO.
How would they stop him they cost it NATO to be exact
Next will be Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.  Then Poland, Slovakia, Germany.  To Putin's mind, EVERYBODY is a threat.
America and it’s allies invade, occupy, torture and drone strike their way around entire regions of the world based on lies, deception and weapons of mass destruction, silence….Russia does similar and all of a sudden the world and our collective loses their minds. The endless gaslighting, and endless compulsive  lies of our own leaders at home in the US, Britain etc are complicit in this mess. The entire world has dishonest, self serving sociopaths for leaders and it all leads to this. Remember when the US invaded Iraq in “self defense”?
see thru it ,,it is a set up.. it look like war ,,but it is covid  agenda    related ,,,GRABBING ,,,,,WHAT YOU CAN AS THE SYSTEM,,FAILS,,,   so your banks and other thing will be next,,,this is a smoke screen for now ,,like covid ,,the only loosers are people  not politicians   never themm,,  always   people,  US,,,
I can’t believe I thought at one point in time Putin was a good person. I hope he gets what he deserves in hell
Send in the navy seal and take out Putin for once and for all
If we keep electing the wrong people to be put in power, sadly, yes
Glory to Putin ..
Im glad this is happening. The more Russia loseing troops the better. Putin is a evil dicktator. So is Assad the Snake of Syria. What do you know ? They both support eatch other. You know why Assad the Snake Of Syria has a lisp ? Its because he sucks Putins dick. It left him with a permanent lisp. These are the type of people that shoot people at a peaceful protest. These are the type of people that wont let you film or do peaceful documentry were you want. These are evil people.
He must understand the world thinks he's Kim Jong Un dumb cousin.
It is surprising when the US, Israel etc are doing to some countries what Russia is doing in Ukraine, we don't hear the voices we are hearing now to the extent of wanting to pick up arms. Why? This needs to stop.
Why are everyone just watching, this makes me mad as hell. Every Country should join forces in this situation and take out that stupid prick who is about to ruin so many innocent lives. Feels like an explosion inside of me just watching.  Take him out and the war is over!
I felt the same whan Iraq went up in flames thousands died on lies of poltichen who are still walking freely and making money
Yay, go Russia. I like how China and Russia keep the world balance from NATO and US world dominance.
Seriously? Like covid wasnt enough for you guys.....also 4:04 Metro exodus
Why War … more people die.. for what 😢… pray for no more War in the World 🌎🥺
Kita warga indonesia mendukung rusia.. agar usa tidak seenaknya sendiri melakukan kewenangan di wilayah negara lain.. maju rusia
Putin: I have no plans to invade Ukraine *invades Ukraine anyways
One way to stop this all is kick all these leaders to touch.
YUGOSLAVIA BEEN SPLIT BY U.S , NOW IS RUSSIA TIME , ISRAEL STRIKE IRAN TO NOT DEVELOP NUCLEAR WEAPONS,  ALL IT WAS OK, NOW IS LOOKS NOT OK? I'M NEUTRAL,  NOT MY WAR , WHO  WANT WAR  TO GO TO FIGHT THEY'RE LIFE THEY'RE CHOICE.
My heart goes out for Ukraine people 🌏
que sacan con esta guerra vidas  que se van es un descerebrado este asesino de putin es igual al presidente de china sin valores ni sentimiento
This is devastating …
Think of people in Middleast too.     Always wars   ..
Am not only blaming Russia , you got to also look on what's the involvement on Ukraine in this , you can't join NATO with whole history you have got in common with Russia , c'mon
Too bad we in Serbia didn't have  BBC covering NATO bombing...
We must boycott all product and brand from Russia.
For what? Why? There's no reason to take innocent lives
🇱🇹❤🇺🇦
Pray for Ukraine 😥♥️
After that many billions and trillions invested in nato where are they? 😀
Stay out of it America, not out business to even have any involvement what soever, look how much out help helped the Afghan.  America needs to take the money that is being used there and feed its own homeless people, which 1 in 3 are Military Veterans
Liars deserve to be hung by their toes. Gouge their eyes out, skullfuck them, and give them the option of either eating your own shit or starving to death.
If you surrender easily then it will not happen.
possibly Putin 
私はただただ悲しい😭そして、私は無力だ何もすることができないただ見守ることしかできない日本も、こうなってしまうのは間違いないだろう。ロシアと中国の侵略によって
Just peacefully give Ukraine to russia.nato is weak.
This is why we have to fight to keep our guns here in AMERICA
Lord have mercy, I stand with Ukraine 🇺🇦 against Putin's unprovoked invasion!
Russia, you go ahead and kill the devilish people of America and Europe. Under the auspices of America and Europe, Israel kills innocent Palestinians.
I just Can't believe this is happening in this day and age. I wish only light and peace.
Ukraine supposed to retained nuclear weapons to deter such aggression, and had a chance to enter in agreement with Europe but ex president chooses to sold Ukraine in 15 billion to Russian by not entering in trade agreement with Europe long ago.
What has led to this point though? The government of Ukraine needs to tell the people truth!
china and russia leaders is 👿
This must stop !!
Wait for it....we are talking about a bigger beast here, it's slower but once it hit it will hurt.
This is not even a war which Russian people wanted. It's just Putin and Biden.
Looking from space this is stupid. Putin is an ego maniac.
Shame on you BBC
When bush and America bombed Syria its normal and when putin starts a war he is evil ? Such hypocrisy. America has been selling weapons to terrorist groups and rebels yet no one says anything. Main stream media is controlled by the west and they portray whoever they want as evil when they are evil to. I’m not saying war is good or justified. Just how other country’s is seeing is Russia is wrong
Putin should be arrested and tried at the Hague
My heart hurts today for the innocent. This is terrible.
looting
I can see putin will get wiped out after acting like Hitler. Ukraine have done nothing leave them alone. Its horrendous to see this in 2022. Whats wrong with Russia just sick
Our outrage are selective.Our emotions are driven by media and their masters.War is all about destruction but people are hypocrite.We must respect different way of life otherwise it is just a matter of number of weapon and the aggressor will become victim.
Why won't Ukraine surrender?
Wow, the one who attacks is the one who said he does it for self defense? Tsk tsk tsk, communist really knows how to play words in expense of civilians life.
I was trying to stay independent as Ukraine is or was not saint in the east but now I'm disgusted and angry with Putin and all Russians. NATO and the rest of the world should just deal with Russians once for all!
Ukrainian Nazis get slapped in the face for the genocide of Russians. Everything is simple. And there's nothing to cry about them.
Putin was talking for decades that Russia will not tolerate NATO missiles across the street but the West ignored it.rThe red line was crossed, the frog got cooked.rBlame NATO and US government for every life lost in this conflict and not Putin who is obviously not a western puppet unlike most of the leaders of EU banana republics.rWest wants to surround, cripple and conquer Russia because of the resources they are controlling.rAlbright once said that there cannot be talk of world fairness as long as a territory such as Siberia is owned by one country.rI would add 
😭
Ukraine is not a real country just as Macedonia isn't or Kosovo.
What a horrible sight to see! I cried watching this and my heart broke for these people. Sending love and prayers to the civilians. ♥️♥️
Finally putin stands up to nato👍
fuck NATO and USA allies, love from🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
You might as well send chocolates for all the good prayer will do. At least chocolate would be of more help
Who in the fuck asked Ukraine PM asked to join hands with USA to take down Russia? The moment russia attacked USA backed out
This would not happen if Trump was in office.
Not trying to be a dick but man the Ukrainian netizens should have been prepared. I hope people can get out before its too late.
We all pray for peace ☮️love from Kenya
Russia will win nothing anyone can do to stop them
while Russia's attack on Ukraine should be condemned, I think it's important to give context to their attack. Why is Russia incessantly on the nerves of Ukraine? I'm not a Russian neither do I support any bloodshed, but Russia's president keep talking about their safety too, so i think the media houses should give a context and unfiltered history to this whole tension between these two nations.
WHY IS THE WORLD LOOKING AND NOT DOING ANYTHING. PLEASE SOMEONE DO SOMETHING.STOP THE RUSSIAN AGRESSION.
Russia go home
All the civilians must be safely evaquat from the war sites
I think the World so called leaders should learn from there mistakes,  because the Europeans should not allow the USA to interfere in their territory.
Poutine the Best
Defend what you must Mr. Putin, but don't hurt the civilians please.
Unbelivable that in 2022 we are still dropping bombs and killing people left and right, stuff you only read in books and see in movies happening again...
Civilians being killed, I've never seen this in this way before.
Destroy all Ukraine. USA is coming soon. Attack them hard Mr. President. We stand with Putin & Russia 🇷🇺
What the fuck wrong with that wicked man Putin
Zelensky thought this was comedy???
Shame on you BLOODYMIR PUTIN!!!!
🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
The kind of terror the people must be experiencing, may they be safe.
War never changes...
Like the west's fiction on attacking other countries or supporting regimes treating some citizens as second class or annexing land! The hypocracy is just crazy
that fireball would be the heavy weapons Biden dropped off just a couple weeks ago. They hit the airports that those 
The U.S. should invade the east of Russia to protect its freedom. Having a Euro centric world view most Americans forget how close Russia and the U.S. are.
What is wrong with this world. Instead of killing children and innocent people, do Rock paper scissors instead.
My heart goes out to everyone in Ukraine.
Funny they didn't care about bombing children in Iraq and I talked to soldiers there where so many  dead kids and wemon the soldiers couldn't walk and the tanks could move and they didn't let any one record it but it happend but there brown right so they have zero rights
PUTIN should b taken out!!!!
Putin is evil
tbh if there's no real response to this it will show putin that he can threaten nukes to those who wish to intervene as a deterent to any war he decides to stage in the future, what next. invade lithuania and threaten nato with nukes?
Evil putin.
Hitler also started 
Start repatriating all Russian wealth held in the UK, until the owners of the; shares, houses, bank’s accounts registered have proven their wealth has not to have generated from aid given to them from Putin. We can start by repatriating Chelsea football club.
God please help Ukraine ppl 🙏🏽🥲🥲

The US instigated it
It's Soo sad to be in the world where people don't care about the lives of the minority. I pray for Ukraine to get the justice it deserves. Please stop hurting innocent souls, where will they hide in such a scary and tough condition. May you get peace soon. Nothing is permanent.
You guys are bunch of hypocrites. Where was the western media when the US invaded tcheckoslovakia and split it into smaller enclaves. Where was the media when the US invaded Iraq under false prentense of having WMDs? Where was the western media when the US prepared a coup against a legitimate elected President in Ukraine? So on and so on.Poutine only asked the west to not station Nato forces at their borders but you guys played the cards of acting like tough guys. Why don't you guys help Ukraine on the ground right now? Why don't you bring your military personal on the ground with your so called sophisticated military hardware in Ukraine? Is that how you abandon your allies. Bunch of cowards.
My heart goes out to everyone, because my heart isn’t prejudice to only some countries.
 @Mamacita  🙄 👍
 @GreatAustinHouse  All Countries Matter!!!
Fake News
Putin is a moron, if you don't want Ukraine to join Nato, you just blackmail or bribe the needed Ukrainian politician.  War is the resort of the stupid or desperate.
Sanctions are good but not enough please save Ukraine
Putin’s Russia must be de-Nazified.  Everything he says is a lie.
Putin is a war criminal
When the fuck does that make any sense Russia saying we did it it in self defense and telling Ukraine to lay their arms down but who was the one that sent 100k troops from their army to the border of Ukraine.
Putin has revealed himself as a liar, which we all knew, and now his entire country cannot be trusted for as long as he’s in charge. Sanction everything in Russia
I like in somewhere really far away from Russia and Ukraine, but I'm still really scared.. for my country and Ukraine 🇺🇦. My heart goes out to all the citizens who have been going through all this. I can't imagine being in their shoes. I hope this doesn't go global..
Where is NATO, TO HELP US? seriously, Ukraine, you want help from NATO...LOL....LOL...This is funny!
Ukraine, just give them what they want. Its a losing battle.
Power parity has always woefully stacked against Ukraine army from the beginning.Russian weapon technology has been rapidly advancing since Putin came to power.
Allah sizi korusun 🤲
US: You need my permission to blow other countries up
Our prayers are with you 🙏 From Jamaica 🇯🇲
None of our business! Stay out!
Boycott all Russian goods if you have a Russian market near you avoid it avoid the bear avoid the red beast
My sincere condolences are with every country where such these wars are happening :(
No better idiom to explain this, this is the calm. Before the storm. Stay safe guys
If US or other countries do not go help Ukraine might not make it.  This is devastating to the entire world.
Go to deep hell potin
Deeper then satin himself or hitler?
All this to satisfy the ego of one man. My heart goes out to both Ukrainians and Russians who will be collateral damage in this war to make Putin feel powerful.I really wish both sides just stop taking orders and simply refuse to fight. It’s humanity over pseudo patriotism. Always.
😥🥺
more fake propaganda from the bbc
Excellent and Brave reporting BBC, God bless you. 🙏Prayers this war is ended swiftly with minimal casualties 🙏🙏🙏
Putin made a big mistake.2 months will be seen when the sanctions bite the russia.😁👍
Lanet olası Ruslar siz bu dünyaya savaş için gelmişsiniz tanrı Ukrayna halkının yanında olsun 🇺🇦🇹🇷🇺🇦🇹🇷
Free Palestine, Boycott Terrorist State Israel
Message to President V.Putin , Do not show power on innocent civilians, one day we all will die, nothing will take with us can you take Ukraine with you?. Hope you know great king Alexandra had evade countries, has he taken anything with him when he die, nothing. Hence Let people to live their life peacefully and happily. As everything is impermanent in this world, whole world should have peace, respect the people life and let the whole world to live joyfully. Help poor countries to build beautiful world rather destroying.
Why isn’t Ukrainian firing back? They have a military and a large stockpile of missiles. It seems like the military would be surrounding their capital! Something is fishy.
The west are hypocrites they won't defend Ukraine God help the innocent civilians
Please peace
Praying for Ukraine 🇺🇦 love from Canada 🇨🇦
I think Putin misspoke there...he doesn't want to DE-nazify the country...he wants to RE-nazify the country!
Be careful the people in the Ukrainian and take care, be safe over there
What is wrong with this world. Insted of killing children and innocent people, do Rock paper scissors instead.
Covid and now This War...HUMANITY DIDNT LEANT NOYHING FROM LAST. SHAMEFUL!
Fuck Putin, fuck all pro-war Russian politics
A very sad day. People are dying. How was this ever an option? Even the Russian people are against this. Cannot believe we are once again bearing witness to such barbarism. And for what? Human life means nothing to some, it's always normal people trying to get by that pay the price. Shame on you warmongers, the blood is on your hands.
You cannot ignore the fact that this issue is years in the making, if the NATO, Ukraine and Russia, all fulfilled the Minsk Agreement, this would have never happened.
All our soldiers are fighting in the east.
So basically mumbling to yourself so you feel like you've made a difference...
 @Senoritabeatmymeata  No need to be a dick. He only wants things to improve.
Regardless, only the civilians will suffer. My heart goes out to them.
Damn these nazi followers.. Damn the likes of putin
Putin will know what Karma is
Living in Modern Warfare isnt something anybody wants or can enjoy.Except Governments
please let me know if theres any way i can go to help Ukraine as a volunteer by fighting by their side
Putin is weak domestically so needs a good war to bolster support.
So... US and UK sacrificed Ukraine for what? Temporary peace, until Putin wants more: Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, Georgia. China will want Taiwan. And we are just going to sit on the sides and watch.
Totally avoidable to join or not join nato
Putin shown for what he is, a lying coward who preys on a peaceful neighbour
And yet there are still people stupid enough to blindly blame the West rather than support the people of Ukraine...
Thank you for the photos.
Remove Vodka
🇸🇮❣️👍
He's calling them nazis??
I am angry with the Western leaders WEAKNESS and  INCOMPETENCE.     More so with SLEEPY  JOE  BIDEN .The most INCOMPETENT President in US history and the STUPID DEMOCRATS that's destroying America right now because of their IDIOT policies.Made Putin decide to invade Ukraine. Western leaders are all COWARDS and  WEAK. NATO and US became PUTIN'S  mere SPECTATORS  as they watch Ukraine bomb by Putin in every side The  WEST, held hostage by Putin's threat.      Sanctions can't stop Putin. which until now you're still arguing. NATO PLEASE HELP UKRAINE NOW from the onslaught of Russian forces,don't just be a cheerer to  Putin while Ukraine is pleading for your help.Help Ukraine militarily to defend its FREEDOM.    DON'T  BE ALL  A BUNCH  OF COWARDS  AND IDIOTS!      Defend Ukraine by all means to preserve its FREEDOM  and LIBERTY as a  Democratic Nation.
I feel no sorry for Ukraine..... Ukraine knows very well what happen to their history. They must stay away from NATO and just hand Ukraine to Russia....
I am from Iraq, we have suffered a lot from wars, and America is the Great Satan for killing innocent people and causing strife between Russia and Ukraine
Where’s all the weapons that America  sent you ,stand your ground.
Let's witness world war 3 ... If somehow some of survive, it will be awesome to tell stories of war to our grandchildren.. Too much peace is bad for population growth control ...go putin go , we are with you ... Gaza , Palestine..this is your opportunity....
Its like.saying its .ot the USA war but washington war. You guys are definitely z propaganda outlet.
Yep
How can Russians get behind a leader that wants this? He’s a new age Hitler! So many people are going to die for what? Pride,money,land? This is truly disgusting. Praying for all the souls that are caught up in this war that wanted nothing to do with it!
According to Putin it’s like someone entering your home and you’re told to put down your weapons and just hand it over.
Putin sucks
Why ?
Fake news 😅 bro
We don't deserve to be called humans anymore
Where’s Ukraine military???
Boris Johnson and Biden's doing ngl...... Kinda sad to be english rn
Can I ask where America and its alliance is????Oh I forgot they can't do anything because Russia is not like Afghanistan Putin is too strong So no war i suppose 🤔 Absolutely disgusting double standards Nato is a waste of space So yet again a mass migration of refugees into Europe Only God  can help us now
Putin coming to hell i am not good to English
This is caused by someone who is trying to make his mark on Russian history and that is all it is. As most tyrants in the modern world have found out it usually is their last act as a leader when they step over the line. Russians rise up against your leader for you are the heart of Russia not some idiot in charge. We did when we booted our idiot out of office to be soon subscribed to the annals of a forgotten history.
lil' Vladimir Putin's dementia is acting up again...lmao!Grampa Munster Putin is still fighting Nazi's in his head...hahahaha!
As if the world needs another fookin war during a pandemic Fook Russia.
Unfortunately the USA invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq set the precedent.
The Worst to imagine has happened, God will keep Ukrainians in his hands🙏🙏🙏

If communists and international bankers simply stopped funding Ukrainian rebels then Ukraine would have never been invaded. Ukraine is Slavic, it belongs to Russia.
And I actually thought Putin was one of the good guys... Turns out he is a disgusting piece of shit like the rest of them...
Respect ✊ Ukraine 🇺🇦
That's what its like in America, if your being robbed you cant protect yourself even if you posses a gun as your deemed a murderer if you kill said robber/invader. Bullshit ain't it.
 @KingTungsten Worldwide  true. Its just a sad predicament Ukraine has to go thru this.
Ur mom fake
 @Добрый доктор ай горит  Заповзти в яму українця перед тим, як на вас впаде кулькова бомба, що новорічні свята
 @Voltatra John  Your Ukrainian is terrible. Try downloading Duolingo 🦉
I wish the leaders could read this😭😭😭
😭Unfortunately, they have no feelings
I hope ukraine president can just surrender and shake hands,bcz there are so many innocents people in ukraine😭😭
 @aman puri  That would effectively make them a Russian puppet.
 @foxymetroid  Either way they are a puppet to US or Russia
Where did the public support a war? In Iraq, Syria, Libya, Afghanistan, Yugoslavia?
All reporters are having a combined War-gasm. I haven’t seen the news outlets so happy since Trump left office.
As many I’m sure we are behind you all in Ukraine, stay strong and hold your ground we are all behind you. Stand firm, fortune favours the brave.
Why would someone wakeup and decide to kill people this is horrible.
This is not a complicated thing  There has been a struggle between the 2 sides of the world since world war 2  The west have wanted global dominationsince ww2 ended. Russia has wanted to resist being enveloped ever since. The double standards of the west put missiles all around Russia  whilst sayingthey would never allow such as Cuba and Venezuela to have Russian ones.   The Russians asked for one thing:   Not to have them in the Ukraine too.  The westsaid there is no point at which they would ever consider playing fair.    And that's how we got here.
from Putin's logic if he gets Ukraine then there will always been a bordering threat to Russia giving endless 
Respect Ukraine 🇺🇦
Dont forget here in the Uk this government is trying to stop protests too.
Who tf is going to buy what Putin says, freaking retarded psycho. How can something count as self defense, when you're invading a country? My head exploded on that, could not compute...
Don't mess with Russia
Horrible!! If this is the new normal, next will be the free people of Taiwan 😓😓 US, EU fuelled the fire and now are roasting marshmallows on it. Shame !
bankers and politicians on all sides are trying to cause this war. don't play along and don't fight in this war for them, you are not their puppet, do not be frightened by their acting. halleluYHWH
Now where is the UN?  Getting paid and nothing working, NATO and the rest of the world should be interfering.  This is modern world landgrabbing,  I hope this dictator Putin slips and goes into a coma.
You are misleading in your headline.This was a military airport,not a civilian airport.Please don't be drumming up unnecessary panic.
Inhuman
@BBC News, stop doing the 
50 million people,  fight ffs 😤 kno point asking the world to help . When your own people won't defend them self
Well Putin is going to be the new hitler
I'm not supprised ! It was expected ! Geostrategic chess party's result . What would say USA ? If there are russian soldiers near the Mexican border ! 😶 I hope that war will end !
NoActionTalkOnlyN. A. T. O
Hahahahahah
This ain’t serial killer he been planning this for months
Hahahahahah
After seeing the horror of Bosnia, this is unthinkable, along with the threat of a new war in Bosnia itself, as Jeremy Bowen pointed out
Prayer for the Ukrainian people.. I hope this won't go on any further to other countries. No to ww3
He’s going insane.
Support Russia
What I don’t understand is why Nato simply could not negotiate with Russia and the EU that Ukraine would remain an independent state, free from nato and free from Russia. That would have removed the putin argument that he is doing this in the name of protecting his country from having American missiles 35 min away from Moscow. The EU say they support diplomatic solutions but succumbed to the pressures of nato pushing for a Ukrainian relationship, way before the American intel came in that Russian troops were amassing at the borders. The right thing to do would have been to tell nato to not go too far up putins ass and to tell putin that he had no reason to invade if nato was to lay off Ukraine. To top it off Nato is providing arms to Ukraine. But the Ukrainian army has no time to train even half of its army to utilise these advanced weapons systems. It takes time to implement them in the core of an army. If they really wanted to act in Ukraine interest they would have done this way sooner and at a faster pace, or they would have settled to leave Ukraine free from nato influence. There is perhaps an agenda to unify Europe again against Putin which will further down the line influence the narrative with China. Macron, Merkel and trump had social political issues with putin but maintained a stronger relationship than the US did, being on the same continent. This is a problem to the US and they need Europe to choke the Russian federation economically and ideologically. You get the EU masses (me, or you the reader) angry about Russia again, it’ll give them the reason to develop their agenda. Not a great start to the 2020s
So what are the Democrats and liberals going to do ?
The sirens got me best of luck to Ukraine from uzbekistan
Send prayers and support from the US. We stand with Ukraine.
West will watch and do shit. Next countries are the one in Europe and not in NATO. Bulgaria is the vassal of Russia so we going to welcome the Russian troops as aways. We like to be brainwashed  killed  and robed by communists.
big support to Putin and the Russian Federation from USA
Thinking of the children, parents and elders. Hoping the very best outcome for Ukrainians. Can't imagine being in that fear with my children.
Putin to be removed
So Russia only has  8 bombs ?
well this is the end of a democratic country for no reason at all
The ppl who's heart is now going for Ukrainian, their hearts should also have gone for iraq, Afghanistan, syria, Libya and Lebanon. Many children and innocent civilians had died there by brutal NATO bombardments there.Westerners enjoyed that war bcz it were muslims who were dying by NATO bombardments and justified NATO actions there. But now suddenly humanity, tears and emotions came in everyone.
not as bad as when US attack Iraq before and not as Iraqi soldiers who plan to give up the Ukkrainian plan to defend their country
This president is such a puppet. He listens to the west and Putin has been patience for 8 years. He should be ashamed of what he has done.
1:20 Indeed, Ukraine is being attacked from all sides. From the north and the east, by the russians. And from the west and the south, the United States and UK! Too bad ukrainians can´t see past propaganda. They think the US is their ally, but americans are in it for the lucrative natural gas deal that they will sign with Europe, now that the russian pipeline deal has been nuked. That was the prime objective. And giving Russia a black eye, too. But mostly, it was about money. Oil money, and weapons money! These are the prime industries of America.The US is rich in oil/gas reserves, but they extremely hard to obtain. The past 2 decades have seen dozens of american energy companies file for bankruptcy, because they just couldn´t compete with middle eastern/russian prices, since they could only tap that oil/gas through fracking, which is extremely expensive. And dirty. So the only way for the industry to stay afloat was by snatching the russian deal. A few years of a media hack job, a coup here and there, followed by a wee little war, and PRESTO! The russians are out, the yanks are in! And Germany gets to pay double for their natural gas, courtesy of their 
Fakenews!

Which part of the Ukrainian people do you give preference to?
Donbass has lived  with thst fear  for  eight years
How about the men?
Nobel Peace Committee are you seeing this?? This is what happens when you give Peace prize to a politician. Now Mr. Putin wants to show to the world who is the actual keeper of peace or on whose shoulders the peace lies safely in Europe. May be you should consider giving Mr. Putin a peace prize. Or a joint peace prize to Mr. Biden and Mr. Putin but that will surely bring Mr. Trump into picture and you should answer him as to why he should not be given the peace prize. So committee, in view of so many families being affected you should revise your policies...I wonder if a prize return from his rival politician will satisfy Mr. Putin's ego...
USA is to be blame for this war...they triggered this war....Russia wants guarantes to its security..but USA and western world is deaf and blind..Russia has no choice but to go to war...
fabrication of the news. Nice twist to suit the Bull, Biased Communication. This is what happens when the bear is poked.
this is sad anywhere ...on the continents...
Lol it's not syria this time
This is what happens when you have weak leaders from the west and the UN is useless ...
Yeah this is Kremlin war as much as was pentagon WASHINGTON WAR for past 30 years dumb F against afgan irak syria and so on ......
Putin is like the big bully in the schoolyard that has the smallest kid by the wrist and says, why are you hitting yourself why are you hitting yourself over and over again as he makes the kid hit himself over and over.
Biden is a god damn pussy, why wont he help out the ukrainian people?!?!
Fuck Russia!
Putin is Idiot...he is doing it for himself, not for Russia...he will be part in History of most idiot Politician...if he is a man, and for the sake of the innocents, let us only fight- find a place to fight one in one, you fuckin idiot...why we people in the world  selected leaders who who is so fucked with ideals...
Self defence bs your god dam disgusting putin
War solve nothing. Looks like the beginning of another the human species stupidity  to destroy itself after covid19.
Russia being under threat!!??? WTF?? WHAT SORT OF EXCUSE IS THAT??
I'm pretty sure those jets looked like su -30 or su-34, su-33 class fighters Russian based Ukraine has ah few  so that is a toss up on who jet those where.
One world order doctrine is dead. The doctrine is destroyed our nation and the free world.The Demoncrat and incompetent FJB eccelarate the dead of our freeworld.
The capture and safe return of Russian Special forces inside Ukraine is very important. Summary execution of any prisoners or civilians... is a war crime. As of noon today US eastern time. President Zalinski has not surrendered. He is with his soldiers. This first battle seems to be focused on airports and anti aircraft sites with missiles.
I Hope Ukraine wins. Love from Lithuania
It's mad to think this is happening right now but at the same time, considering the fact it's a power hungry psycho f**kboi like Putin, i'm not surprised. Love to Ukraine from UK
It's not that easy you idi*t that would literally mean world warIII.
Putin hitler 2.0
They cant win :( Russia Is the strongest country :((
He don’t have to destroy anything if u stop being a hard head and give up Putin isn’t a monster like the fake news makes it seem and go back to be what u were Russia territories
As history repeat human can't stay without war  look in history may God help those in need
Ой бля*ь хотели войны - получили, распишитесь. Жутко это все, никто в России не хотел этого, уверен, в Украине люди тоже этого не хотели. Но имьицилы в политике об этом не думают. Кто виноват я не знаю
That was just a terrorist not Russian missle
NATO and US intefearing in every country's matter did this
Ukrainian citizens: where is NATO to help us?? NATO is not for help for peoples. NATO is for destroy peaceful countries.
Okk
It's funny that the only people reporting an attack is the propaganda TV stations? Everyone has a phone, everyone can post videos, yet there are none? Only propaganda from other countries
It has begun, ww3 will surely come, hug your family's, stock pile as much as you can. The coming storm will not be kind to the weak.
Can someone stop this 😫?. This is sad
I wish the best for people but its there lands and he's protecting his country and 100s of millions of people maybe they should just join Russia at lest they would have there backs unlike NATO
World war is going to happen not long we will all be apart of it
America and Nato played with fire. Nato must Honor their agreements with Russia. Ukraine allowed themselves to be used by Nato in exchange and in the hope of becoming a Nato member. They trusted america and britain same as Russia did only to left out in the cold. They should have taken note of the usa dealings and actions in Iran where the usa withdrew from an international agreement.  Nato is in it for their own benefit only. Ukraine army should raise the white flag and spare the lives of their people. Sign a peace deal with Russia and live as good neighbours. Never allow nato close you because they bring death and destruction to you people.
Ukraine government, You get what you asked for. BTW My heart goes out to the ukraine civilians because they didn't asked for this.
RUSSA WIN!!!
Why wasn't there a livestream of the war in Serbia in 1999 when the whole NATO bombed a country without the UN security council approval?Or in Iraq in 2003 that was attacked on false allegations for terrorism connections?Or in Afghanistan in 2001 for the same reason? Those big ugly terrorists that were actually from Saudi Arabian royalty?Or in Syria in 2010?Yemen in 2015? Maybe because USA and UK don't want the world to see when they are killing people half the globe away.Hypocrisy.
This could have been avoided. Another war. I am 55 yrs olds and am sick of the millitary budget dictating the world we live in. That is what this is. The Ukraine cried out to be supported to be neutral. The US love it. China have put us in a pincer movement.
Why the world is seeing this? Ukraine, must attack Russia side and die fighting, no UN just war!!!
1991 cope
Idk how these young men plan to fight if they are not in their units already.
Fkin STOP ,this shit
War is hell, it's a failure of leadership.  What is the spin BBC is putting on this?
I knew the war was going to happen. When the big guys steps on each others toes they have to make a move. It is true that Russia has been feeling threaten and sorrounded for a long time by Europe and US with the expanding bases around Russia. And as a superpower you can't let that happen. All of them have their own interest in mind and conflicts are bound to happen at everybodies expense. That's just the sad reality.
Corrupt politicians need this war to funnel vast amounts of money into their own pockets.
Self Defense is a false statement. Stunning to hear him say this Self Defense statement. Who attacked who? Whose army surrounded Ukraine. World is watching. We are with people and praying for the safety of all. Pls. Russia think of your fellow brothers n sisters.
Why should americans die for your useless men who refuse to fight. Afghanistan  men were the first to run leaving women behind. cowards.
This would not have happened if you had reported before and said how many civilians died in eastern Ukraine and under the constant siege of the Ukrainian army and various world paraformations.rAnd it is all of you who are sending weapons to kill these people in the east of the country.rNow that you have angered the Russians !!!Brothers and sisters Ukrainians (but not those who support this western clown Zelinski) and brothers Russians ... don't let the people perish because every life is important !!!
So stupid
My heart goes out to all effected.
My heart is with Ukraine, someone must fight for those who cant fight for themselves. Good will prevail in the end.
GO TO HELL PUTIN!
Putin should get Nobel peace prize as his decisive move is beneficial to a new world order
JESUS IS COMING SOON,,, leaders all over the world, its time to surrender to JESUS CHRIST because you all have the hearts of wild animals full of EVIL... There will be no peace in the world unless you all accept JESUS!!! AMEN 🙏
I'm from Syria and I can exactly how it feels ❤️😭peace prevails
The weakness of western leaders lead to this.
Vile propaganda outlet the BBC - Putin warned, pleaded, reasoned for non expansion of NATO eastwards for 30 years, and for the internationally agreed Minsk agreements (which Truss couldn't even pronounce, nor could Johnson - are there too many syllables in the word Minsk?) to be implemented... even up until the last days, at which the arch-moron himself Zelenski spoke openly about re-arming the Ukraine with nuclear weapons, and incredibly Johnson had to stir it up even further by sending weapons, bringing the UK into the affray. It beggars belief that the UK could be so stupid. So sorry to all my Russian and Ukrainian friends - the US/UK military industrial complex (and the BBC) thinks it's of more worth than your very lives.
Where is United States? They are the only ones more powerful than Russia. They should work fast
This makes me so sad. I will be praying for Ukraine and all the beautiful people who live there. May god bless the people and give them safety.
This doesn't need to happen. Stop it please. Think about innocent lives 😭
😂😂😂
Don't worry bro this western destroyed us before
I feel ur pain bro from India. How they looted us in past. But I want peace.
I've thought about Syria in this as well. Hope you're able to stay centered. Probably re-traumatizing to hear about this. 💌
🤣🤣🤣
where were the prayers of the people being killed daily by Ukranian Nazi shelling in the Donbas?
 @TheRedRepublican  They don't work anyway

Wow 3rd world War humans   forget too quickly. No one wins and the only one that wins are the weapons manufacturers.
😥
hey if you can't defend Ukraine then you should not be able to keep it.
Just remember guys, when you use your sanctions to hurt everyone in Russia, you don't unite everyone against the true enemy but the opposite (in many cases).
sic semper tyrannis. My heart goes out to Ukraine
If Biden had lead WWII America, Washington might be occupied by Nazi and Japanese now. And most of the American was struggling in the camp.
The lady that casually said surrender hmmm seriously? Never surrender fight for what's yours! May God protect the people of Ukraine and give them courage.
Sputin is a DEMON
The lying tne Sun can report to its foreign minister, who is called a chicken - to insult a chicken, that the price of small Britain is equal to two 
What a SOB….hope they sink Putin….
Give Russia Crimea and make sure Ukraine stays neutral
Putin is the antichrist and wants to destroy all humans on earth jus to fill his dreams of death n destruction.  Rise up every one and send Hitler/Putin to hell.  Fk Russia and Putin
May god help us all
I never support Russian invention butThis is the way Israel annexed Palestinians land.... Westerns helped Israel to annexed...!!!! Feel it....
Those poor Ukrainians. A big F U from Putin to Ukraine and the west.
Nato and the US caused all this....why try too build military bases next too the big enemy...they knew this all too well
😞
We will see more kardashian/kanye news. Thats the way they distract the world
Devastating
Where is the Ukraine government military can’t you guys fight back against Goliath,B A David.

What else would an old woman say?
 @James Clapp   Are you assuming every old woman thinks the same?
 @Aquarius Dragon  I'm saying only an old woman would say surrender.
I am praying for Ukraine 🇺🇦
If 🇺🇦 wouldn’t become british/usa puppet from 1991 this wouldn’t happen.
this is wrong wrong wrong wrong!!!!
Wheres the fight back?
This is not cool. It needs to stop. They need to find another solution to solve differences between Russia and Ukraine.
To Ukrainians Civilians : sorry we can’t do anything for you. It is a shame that lives will be lost again for a pointless war. May Allah help you .I hope Putin will burn in Hell . The most evil of all .
Every fit and healthy man should get their families to safety across the border stand and fight for their country against dictatorship
Welp, everyone knows vladimir is second craziest next to kim jong un. They are ready to set it off. Deep down this is what they want.. in other words give them a m’f reason! And it’s going down
Is this coz Ukraine refuse to be a part of Russia???? Kinda childish…For instance in from England and Scotland left Britain years ago and another instance England left Europe and no one started a war for that so putin is kinda getting on my last nerve Soooooo… anyone wanna lend me a pistol or shotgun? When the leader dies they become weak and will just leave it
This is crazy !!!!
😪
Really I am so sorry Ukraine 🇺🇦 public peoples really today broken my heart
Guess who's behind it all?............. AMERICA.
Lets go Brandon
The Iron Curtain needs to be drawn again . This time by the west . NATO needs to increase it presence in the countries that border Russia and all NATO countries now need to pay there way . No more shirking there responsibilities to the organisation in the way that France and Germany have done for decades now .  We all want peace but we need to now all be willing to pay for it .
Not to change the subject. YouTube had to explain what BBC means?
If America involved then this will be the WW3
Only wish my country (UK) had done more to help Ukraine and done more to prevent this awful conflict. I hope now that we do more than just strong words and sanctions, and we step up and really help those in Ukraine and provide a safe home for those who have been forced to flee their home. I’m not religious, but I hope that this madness ends before there is too much bloodshed and suffering on all fronts. No good can come of this and it will be the ordinary people on all sides who suffer most.
The only way not to be attacked by Russia is to be part of it? That's not how the world work.

You fkn liars BBC........!!!
Where is NATO countries to help? on there way I hope......
Puttin you knob.. crimes against humanity.. you Do not have the right to do this.
If you do not fight for your country then you deserve to lose it. Afghanistan  men were useless. They ran away.
But sadly, no one's heart goes out, both literally and ironically
Those sirens are devastating
I hope you guys in EUROPE are safe and please have faith in god Prayers from the Philippines
very nice
Usa and Russia are counties killing Ukrainian....terrible politicians
Russia will invade Ukraine very fast because Nato will not do anything to stop them! I am part of Nato, and neighbor of Ukraine but even to us ,Nato said will not send troops to protect our borders...Ukraine will not exist soon because of all the countries of Europe who are shitting in front of Russia instead of taking action.Prays and thoughts...don't do shit..action does.
Where is the Ukraine government can’t fight back
Do not believe the lie of Russia helping Ukraine!!! Ukraine is an independent and self-sufficient country. get out of there russia
Jy sal in die turf kak jou bliksemse kommunis Putin!!! Moenie probeer die Boere aanvat nie!! Jy gaan kak!! If South Africa sends 500000 Boers to Ukraine to fight....then Russia is fucked!!!
Disgusting how innocent people are murdered because politicians don’t agree with each other. Stick them all in a ring and fight to the death, cowards.
Praying for y’all

MADNESS!!!!!! My heart is with Ukraine right now 🇺🇦
What the fuck is the UN , the NATO and the USA doing? UN and NATO are piece of shit organization. This should not happen at all. Russia should be dealt heavily both military and economy.
Why doesn't Europe and the US send their troops to defend Ukraine? Like they did with other countries, that's if they really do care, cause these sanctions....
I’m confused, why are they attacking Ukrainian?
Go down fighting Ukraine
Yesterday : Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, Lybia, SeriaToday : UkraineThese are fair
Ukraine:Puton sadMykraine:Putin happy
We should call the bully’s bluff and send over troops to Ukraine. A bully knows only brut force and respects nothing else
Putin says he doesn't feel safe because of Ukraine and he is only bombing Ukraine in self defense.  Does Putin really think anyone in the world is going to believe him, other then Fox news and the Republican party?
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is a war of aggression!!!
Democracies vs post truth tyranny--Putin, Jinping, Trump.
This is horrifying…my heart goes out to the Ukrainian people 😢
Stand ur ground! Help is on the way!
DEMOCRATIC LOGIC; THE INVASION OF AMERICA IS CALLED EQUITY BUT, THE INVASION OF UKRAINE IS CALLED WAR! HUNTER BIDEN ONE MILLION DOLLAR SALARY MUST BE PROTECTED.
I was born and grew up in Yugoslavia's end days. Where was the NATO when I was a kid that grew up in basement, showered by the cluster bombs and depleted uranium? Oh yeah, NATO was protecting the world order by bombing the shit outta my city and a little kid that was scared and whose life was ruined only because he was born on the wrong side of the curtain. I feel Ukrainians, I know how it feels in your spine and bones when you hear the siren of airstrikes. I also understand that it is beyond their power. In the 99's, Bill Clinton said that civilians killed in NATO actions are colateral damage that was nessesary in order to protect from greater evil. Many years of WEST playing world police officers for its own gain is what pushed EAST to act like a cornered animal. I do not support any kind of agression. But we must admin that this problem is FAR more complex than just Russia being the bad guy. Russia didnt start building military bases near west coast - for example. This is only an act to stop pushing and playing with fire. I am sorry that Ukrainians has to 
Putin needs to be stopped with his war calling if it’s not stomped early.
The Russians have put in. The UK, has mister blobby....  I feel for the Ukraine.  They will get hollow words from the west.

You willing to be on the Frontline stepping to the bully?
 @Jamel P. Burgess  We either do it now voluntarily in Ukraine or the bully will step into NATO territory sooner or later. Remember Hitler
Your 
 @dev stuff  guess I should pray for you too…to learn how to be kinder. All I can do is wish for people to be well.
Ukraine is done. Long live Russia.
 @Oh My Sophii  Which part of the Ukrainian people do you give preference to?You don't care about the eastern part for 8 years.
 @Oh My Sophii  he has a point I mean it’s very kind of you but yeah pray but it isn’t always necessary
 @Oh My Sophii  your intent is good but its stupid,very stupid in fact you should meet your god right now
Does ot go out to Donbass people?
I'm praying for the Ukranians that they be safe , that no harm befall them. May God be with all of Ukranians.
Stay strong Ukraine. Putin knows that a coward man sat in the white house with corrupted team. Today Europe needs to Donald Trump as us president
Ukraine was a “threat” to Russia? Holodomor Mr Putin. Holodomor.
Donbass war starts 2014. Kiyv have 8 years for implementation Minsk II. My soul hurts about every killed people but our armed forces finally must stop this war. Братья-украинцы, берегите себя и свои семьи. Не подставляйтесь под огонь. Нам вместе отстраивать то, что разрушено за 8 лет после Майдана.
Unfortunately Ukraine became a Pawn in the slug fight between the West and Russia.  Remember the Manroe Doctrine?  The US under the 100 plus year old doctrine spelt out any interference by foreign powers in Americas will be considered as a threat to the U.S.  Russia has its own Manroe Doctrine.  They don’t want its border state join Nato as this would mean an armed neighbor next door.
Russia can never control the air is he deluded
The same 
The disintegration of USSR by age old sabotage from USA and its western allies, specially the UK, historical and blood connectivity among Ukrainian and Russian people and expansion as well as aggression of NATO towards the territories(vicinity) of Russia is (among others) the cause of Russo-Ukraine conflict . Leaders of the world should de-escalate this war diplomatically rather than military  means and sanctions against Russia. Now is the time for the world to prevent the most eminent word-war III.
British propaganda. hail the queen
We stand with Ukrainian 🇺🇸
Rotar blades of an American helicopter can be heard as it gets closer you can hear them blaring out 'Fortunate Son '🤣
World peace
Really I am very sadly today where is American president are you sleeping Bided
Putin, war criminal?As an aside, let's hope all those Javelins and NLAWs are now being put to good use.
why is it needed to fight or they want to reduce population of earth?
every Ukrainian needs to pick up arms, don't do what afgans did and run away!
I am from Texas, for those of yall who don't know we are very firearm friendly, that being said, every russian military coward would be dodging every bullet I own if I was there. Putin you are a b*tch made boy, never was a man.

don't forget U.S. invaded Cuba, some people may die, but that's a sacrifice politicians are willing to accept
what the hell is wrong with this man???
Everything is true, but the way western media presents the news focusing on young girls emotions rather than facts is disgusting. For example the guy with a baby in metro said in calm voice 
What part of Iraq did he hit first?
Common sense...   Someone asked me today what is nato ...I explained it this way ..nato Is group of countries that make a promise to protect small countries...now if a Bully comes along like Iraq 🇮🇶...we as nato is to go in spank thier ass...for picking on another country...So if Russia invades Ukraine 🇺🇦..Then if nato dont stop the bully ...RUSSIA ....then we have no use for Nato in the future. .then China can invade Taiwan 🇹🇼...and Russia can take back thier old land ..so NATO is worthless and everyone is out  for themselves. ...nato gets abolished....now everyone can be a bully ..point taken
Get fucked, NATO.
Dear Ukraine seek peace with Russia
Putin pushing 🅿️
Shame on Timid fat wit eunuch putin
Self defense my hairy @$$h0le
God Bless Ukraine! My heart goes out to Ukrainian people with love from Uzbekistan🇺🇿♥️🇺🇦
BBC as usual doing propoganda story reporting
another lie, russia isnt attacking civilians, if ukraine ultimately listened to russia and stick to the planned they laid out back during the dismantle of the ussr, this never would have happened, ukraine got cocky and even more so when the west pushed encouraged them to do so 🤷🏻‍♂️
NO WAR PLEASE ❤️🙏🙏
If NATO did not interfere, it would never happened.
My heart goes out to all the people in Ukraine and Russia may god bless you all 🇺🇦🇷🇺
It's not 'cidizens', it's 'citizens' ffs!
How tf is this self defense?
Why only Ukraine and Russia? My heart goes out to all the world because I’m not prejudice.
Russia being invaded too?
 @brianmig88  no it’s because many innocent Russians will be affected by all of this and they don’t deserve it.
May God be with you. I am so very sorry that this is happening to you. Putin is a monster.
God bless Ukraine and the Ukrainian people! We Georgians exactly know what you are going through. Occupying Russia repeated what it did  in Georgia in August 2008. We pray for you  brothers and sisters. Glory to Ukraine! ✊🏻 🇺🇦❤🇬🇪
Hail Russia
SOON SCORPIONS WILL WRITE AND SING WIND OF CHANGE 2 AFTER THE WAR BETWEEN RUSSIA AND UKRAINE 🤔
Human kind was just starting to live normally not even after this Covid  that was created by the Communist C. Now this Communist Russia will start to create another war and vast bloodshed and who knows this coukd be the start of the 3rd World War.See how the devil making this communist countries to distribute Evil works to mankind. People and families are trying to live normal life with peace and love.Leave us alone!!!!MF!!!!
How many still can’t see its NATO who’s fuelling it?
We could never see this much emotion for the defenders when west was attacking...
OMG these poor people! Ukraine didnt ask Putin for help to change their Government.
No ones gonna do  shit again. Democracy is dead.
UK should welcome all Ukrainian refugees
seeing that baby truly broke me to my core. the things we take for granted everyday.
Fake crying 🤦🏻🤦🏻🤦🏻. BBC continue the propaganda. STOP THE ZIONIST AGENDA. ZIONIST VS RUSSIA
Lesson: stop being used to threaten Russia because soon or later they will attack and you will finally realise that you've never had any ally. Learn from Georgia.
Yea its realy bad when the sirens start to play as the jets above are bombing your countrie, well shoud have stayed neutral insted you sold yourself to the devil.
Blame NATO and United Snakes of America. Same warmongering country trying to use Taiwan to provoke war with China. US need to be stopped.
Oneday the owner of the world will come. Sorry for Ukraine citizens
Reading through the comments it's sad not to see the same sentiment when Israel bombs the shit out of Gaza.
God bless Russia. It is funny to hear news from countries which they still have colonies and stilling from them to build own shitholes .We all remember how many civilians killed america,and uk and the rest of nato in Serbia. We will never forget and never forgive .
UN needs to put in some work now stop sanctions start acting, act now dont repeat the mistakes of appeasement
Russian trucks looks different 🧐 bla bla bla
There you guys have it...your favorite president starting war. Putin
My God it's bad USA has a old fossil that is incoherent running this country but Russia has a cold blooded Clinton destroying people an cities 🙏🙏🙏 Putin is as bad as our devil
Better to know once capacity.
Why don't you come to America you Ukraine refugees but don't bring any liberal shit oh you mean Biden won't let you in because you're white don't feel alone the Biden administration don't like patriot's here either
I want to explosion a bomb on head of the Pithin.
NATO not helping humanity…. leaving the innocent die on the streets is horrible…..
This is going to go on intil russa is they only ontenent in Erth soon 😔 😟 🙁 😥
that's a war of influence, don't you think even the BBC news has a side in this story?
Would be nice if the US took action instead of sanctions
#HAGUE
Looks like they’re using an American Iraq invasion playbook.
You know what I don't support? The never ending attempt to expand U.S. military and cultural hegemony over the entire world through it's proxy organizations and puppet regimes. This is U.S. neo-con foreign policy bullshit - The knowing provocation of Russia by trying to expand U.S. military presence closer to Moscow through yet another U.S. backed puppet regime.The people starting this 'war' are the ones now feigning victim status - If you don't want a war with Russia - Stop trying to polarize the buffer states between NATO / EU states & Russia - It's that simple.The U.S. neocon foreign policy department wants a war with Russia because they don't have control over it (yet), the same reason they fear China and Iran - Anything that isn't 100% in the hands of the most disgusting warmongering neo-cons on the planet must be confronted, destroyed and submitted to the freaks that control the Washington regardless of the loss of life or the illegality of their actions - The neo-con cries out as he hits you.
Ukraine is purged by Russia, Ukraine should be relax will help painless
I support Ukraine
Russia ❤❤🇷🇸🇷🇸
The liberation has come: the USA regime is falling apart meanwhile China and Russia are allies and the new world leaders of today!
Self defense?  Did Ukraine bomb Russia?? I don’t think so. Putin has to go!!
Plz stop war Mr Putin... humanity only survive in this world plz sir..
Putin is right. NATO SOP EXPANDING!!!!! Not much to ask... Ukrain join EU. BUT NOT NATO
This will not end so easily. I know Russian and was waching russian media - they are reporting that Russia is cleaning Ukraine from Nazcis. In social media people are cheering army up and saying they are happy for the military operations.Looks like russians have lost their last sense of mind. Putin all over media is speaking that he holds autumn bomb and he will fight till the end.
If Russians do not support war then they should put Putin in pschiatric cleaning - its schosifrenic with autom bomb chasing Nacis.
When the US, the UK, NATO, the UN, the EU agreed to bomb Yugoslavia, Syria, Libya, Iraq, and when they protected the Turks who killed innocent Greek Cypriots, in your interests and to kill after all, only civilian population, then there was no problem for you. When Russia tries to defend its interests and its people, then you, the real fascists of the New Order order, call Vladimir Putin  fascist and Nazi. Jesus Christ, whom your Zionist leaders hate very much, is the righteous judge. And this time the war will become global because of your facking  Satanist governments and you will be destroyed.
Ask yourself why don’t they hit police,government buildings?
Everyone in the world had better fight against this, or else it could come to your country next.
Im from Hungary. Our neighboor is Ukraine so im pretty scared too. If things go wrong i will escape to switzerland. Prayin for you Ukrainian people, god bless you all!🇭🇺🇺🇦
Russia is number 1
Sadly, Putin the pussy / bully !
Awfull images … a paranoid leader is a dead threat. My thougts go to Ukrainian citizens.
Nato's fault! I feel for all the innocent people who want to live a good life
Soooooo, is nato going to 
Why is it that all of this journalist in Ukraine are old?
the leaders and their ego, sacrifice their own people! fuck war, fuck politics! my heart goes to all Ukrainian people, stay strong!
So.....The last Ukrainian President was outstead by aid from the West. Then the West kept putting weapons in Ukraine. The new approved President arrested his political rivals, shut down press and aided Joe Biden gain wealth by protecting his son's company. Putin is supposed to be ok with the arms. While the entire DNC has claimed he aided Trump....Whom sanctioned Putin and kept him in check. Traitor Joe lifted those sanctions..... Putin is bad no doubt but you know what is worse than a bully? One who is acting under justification. This is the fault of the Traitor Liberal American Establishment. Had they not stuffed the ballots. Trump would still be President and this would not be happening.
Civilians should not be in the city. Pack the kids and cross the border. Europe will accept refugees. I speak from experience. My parents stayed in town, I would not recommend it to anyone. Why? Who will celebrate you if 95% of them left the city. You will always be a minority. Save a life.
WW3
We are in 2022, the wars never have to happen... But the decision of a power-hungry man destroys the peace that we try to keep 😔
Russian soldiers die, Ukrainian soldiers die, civilians die. Mothers cry, families are ruined. what is a child's house without his father? What does a mother do when they bring the body back? The leaders sit in the comforts of their homes, get to spend time relaxing while the soldier pays the price of their egos.
Why should  civilians suffer
come to UK
Romania is literally less than 400 km from Crimeea so we're in trouble
 @Robert Gabriel Barbu  yea
 @ducky  But it wouldn't happen cause we are in NATO and if Russia will attack Romania or Hungary or Poland it means that is an attack on all of the NATO
At least Romania is lucky with the Carpathian Mountains
Nobody can stop Russia bcoz they aren't like Afghanistan and Iraq
The BBC drama series!
Its going down that's for sure.....I just don't understand why the world needs this full stop
Please 🙏 SUBSCRIBED brother and sister thank you
Shame on him
Ukraine is not a threat and outin starts making a lie aboyt killing nazis??? My guy shut the fuck up and dig a grave Putin!
THESES GOD LESS PERSON IS LED BY SHYTAN
Apperantly Biden haven't learned anything from Georgian Condlict of 08.
This will be WW3 if NATO and US don't act now
Ukraine is purged by Russia, Ukraine should be relax will help painless
Please, stop it. In the end of the war, Leaders shake hands but mothers wait for thier sons. Sorry civilians.
These governments are full of masculin and greedy egos... we need to raise the female energy and soon on this planet. Why not make a beautiful life instead of war... brainless and soulless poeple! Do you think you will take something with you when you die? No money, no materials, no country. People wake up and stop voting for these criminals. We don t need them. We have an inner power, use it.
Putin is saying that Ukraine are Nazi like yet they’ve got their police acting like the SA and arresting anyone in their country that protests against their government. My thoughts are with Ukraine 🙏
Putin’s face is so evil! My heart breaks for the Ukranian people
Just getting the vodka out from the Christmas tree where is has been safely nestling since Christmas.  Now having a bit.  Still got the other vodka under the tree. Even brandy too.   Can't wait till I get to the tequila under my bed next week.
I’m a Burmese and we know how it feels to fear for your lives and your loved ones’. And how it feels to wake up to these horrible sounds of terror. We are praying for you, Ukraine. 😔
Blame biden he is softer than my 4ply toliet paper
Already!?
💯
Stop the Vodka coming into the country :P
Thank you very much! From the capital of Ukraine!
Stop war...stop killing innocent people 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
This is so evil.
Rest of the EU swinging balls around.
So HORRIBLE, :_:Thank you for actually reporting on what's happening, all other western media seems more obsessed with Putin's bowel movements than what is actually happening in Ukraine!
This should be a lesson to countries who are siding with NATO & US.Where is NATO??? Where is the US?They abandoned Kurds in Syria They abandoned Afghans against Talibans.They have abandoned Ukraine against Russia.Cowards. 🐷
So where is NATO?
This is not Good vs Evil, It's evil vs evil, while the good are stuck in the middle
Hitler did the same thing in Poland in September 1939...said the polish invaded Germany which was false...it was his excuse to go and invade....Putin took the same route.
O people of Russia, you are generous, not for war with Ukraine, you are brothers and do not be like America, the enemy of the peoples that destroyed Iraq, Syria, and Yemen. We Iraqis love Russia and we are proud of them from our children. We learned that Russia is our friend and does not carry hostility against us. Please, no to war, please.
What comes after he has taken the Ukraine.
Shame on you inhuman hypocrite arrogant lousy fuck all Russia 🇷🇺 yuck 🤮
Putin talks of de-Nazification, yet he is the one that's acting like Hitler,  and Rusia is acting like NAZI GERMANY invading Poland for the same reason in Ukraine.  WW2 started for the same reason.  The AXIS powers have made their first move in WW3.  How many millions of civilians will die this time?
American imperialism is the reason
Rusism like nazism
Your words mean nothing. Where the fack is NATO? West countrys like always can only talk and draw on the sidewalks.
Disgusting impeccable move!! The true is they can destroy most of this world, sad for us..
We miss you Trump
My deepest respect for the russian protesters. They serve russia better than anyone.
Indonesian Palestine.  ▄︻̷̿┻̿═━一
Save humanity
BBC 😂🤣NO NEWS
Russian civilians in Russia are the ONLY hope we have to avoid a nuclear war. They must take down Putin from the inside in any means even if it means killing him.
🇺🇦🇹🇼❤️
They ask here is NATO to help us ....well USA i NATO got you into this in the first place.
The world leaders and political experts are trying to avoid using the term 
Question so is the uk going to war too
Today will be remembered in history the same as 1 september 1939. Guys, the war people predicted for the last 10 years just started. If NATO sends it's troops to defend Ukraine and eastern Poland, we might expect China to invade Taiwan. I expect a full blown war in the next years maybe 4-8. With anti-satelite missiles, cyberattacks, missiles, anti-SAM defense missiles and so on. Maybe active defense on bombers, swarms of decoys, AI and so on. Hope the casualties will be to a minimum, God help us for them not to exceed 500 000.
https://youtu.be/_mLA_GWiKM8 tymczasem Władek straszy świat .
SHYTAN COMMAND THEM TO STEAL LAND AND PEOPLE
This will not be the end, this is the start of a 16 years of war, and also Taiwan will go under, occupation of the Chinese sea, and go on, in Europe prices will rise, demonstrations starting in the south slowly turn into civil wars, Einstein once said I don't know how the 3e WW will be fought but the 4e WW will be with wooden sticks. Prepare for the worst to come. This is just the start.
Why civilians have to suffer from political issues everytime?
GOD BLESS UKRAINE & ALL PEOPLE , STAY STRONG PRAYING FOR UKRAINE PEOPLE .
This devastating war might not bring an ultimate Glorious Victory for Russian Empire, but certainly, it will bring drastic changes to our world.r•tA “New World Order”r•tA “New Global Peace & Security Arrangement” r•tA “New World Reserve Currency”r•tA “New Economic & Monetary Policy”  r•tA “New World Bank”r•tA “New International Law”r•tA “New International Relation”r•tA “New International Court”r•tA ”New United Nation”r•tAnd most importantly a ”New United Nation Security Council” rrWill be as the result of this costly & bloody war.
Ukraine War https://youtu.be/7IoOdyrV3D4https://youtu.be/7IoOdyrV3D4https://youtu.be/7IoOdyrV3D4
You have been expecting this and you kept instigating Russia, why not take out all your Nato bases from near Russia if thats how the problem will be solved
Pure madness.  Thanks to NATO’s and US arrogance.
Nato support in Ukraine might seem needed but more than likely would lead to a nuclear war and military support in combat should be done by private contractors to try end the war without causing a larger one
Putrid Pansy Putin liar liar pants on fire! 🙏for Ukraine.
🍌
Just 😭
The ppl of the world all live in fear in the hands of a few... how sad is humanity.
I'm an American! An to watch this happen to Ukrainian people is really got me pray the the world as well the UN an United States would come to the aid to Ukraine.  This brings back history of America an how we go aid from France to help us become a independent country witch is now free!
Pray for Ukraine 🇺🇦 pray for world peace
Hitler 2.0
Yet T-rump is calling this brilliant.  Since when does the U.S former presidents embrace this kind of insanity.
I pray to God that this stops
This is a horrible sight. Hope everyone is safe and my heart goes out to the civilians. ❤❤much love
HELLO UMMMMM   NATO???  WHERE THE FUCK ARE YOU!!!!  Sanctions DON'T DO SHIT LIKE HE CARES!!
Bla bla bla …So where is western protection ? Where is your soldiers ? Fuck your solidarity, and comments..This war and blood on you
All in self defence they haven’t even done anything dumb fcxk
God bless Ukraine ❤❤❤
Denazification of Russia should be the World's concern ... Ukraine will be free you, Putler!!!!
Ohh my god!! Help ukraine from this living hitler on earth…. PUTTIN!!
V for  Russia  Down for nato
Between the power struggle between two powerhouses always innocent people will get hurt.America destroyed Middle east, Russia is trying to destroy Ukraine.
bbc doesn't need airport
A true soldier doesn't want to win a  war instead he doesn't want to see his country in a war🥺
NATO is  probably in on it my brother
All prayers of the entire world are with Ukrainian. Salute to the humanity and peace. I’m with you Ukraine 🇺🇦
Yes america right? Ur nato is responsible.
Was it no way that this can can be avoided?man this sucks
Worst thing of all... Putin will solve this finally... Time has proven that he needs to solve it by himself since there are no reasonable people on the other side... So there will be no reason to further useless confrontations further more...
THESES RUSSIAN SOME OF THEM WERE DO NOT BELIEVE IN ALLAH AND HIS MESSENGER

If this PUTIN was  a black guy ,he would have been silenced a long time ago ...🤔🤔
Now, you feel the pain of Syria . So, why the world is silent when Israel attacks everytime on Syria unnecessary.
❤️ UKRAINE
No one cared for Syria when Russia was bombing them with the US..this isn't shit..
why is male running away? DO somthing to save your own country when the west dun give a fuck !
I don't know about you but I'm a heavy sleeper to the point where I can just sleep past the whole war siren thingy when they are doing annual testing. Well, I guess war is hell...... I'm from Singapore btw
Thought and prayer wouldn't help them. Send your troops fool. But of course you will not do anything.
🇪🇦❤️🇷🇺
Perang sih perang, dilapangan terbuka sana,  biar warga sipil gk jadi korban anj 🤣 aduh tinju kyk tauran 😭
Hand out the guns to the civilians !!
Let's all attack Russia together
stop war
Ukraine is about to be taught a lesson they should have learned long ago 
any doubt bou nationalism in ukraine? even historians, teachers, directors... all doctrinated in ukrainian nationalism.....
Putin is Libran, a supposedly peaceful sign. Sadly he has scorpio rising and was born in the year of the dragon. The worst combo for a leader imaginable. We need to pray that this sorry excuse for a man drops down dead.
Go stop it then
If it was America everyone would be bitching about it, but since it is Russia everyone is like I pray for Ukraine like it is not Russia responsible for this situation.
What utter bullshit.
Let’s just all attack Russia an erase them there useless and we don’t benefit off them
I love war... TR RU are brothers
NATO and fear western leaders have caused this, not Putin. Western media is so one sided.It is obvious the west is weak up against Russia and China.Forget about climate change and Covid and gender equality, it’s war and shit just got real.The western leaders are in a pathetic panic and don’t know what to do.
SLAVA TO RUSSIA ! hypocrisy in the comments is too funny... all the support coming from the worlds biggest terrorist USA
May god repay russia in kind
What about Iraq, Afghanistan,  Libya,  Syria,  Syria,  Yemen, York Yugoslavia, Lebanon etc etc???????
“Where’s NATO to help us”? Ummmmm you’re not a part of NATO. Say it with me folks…..THIS IS WHY YOU SPEND A LARGE PORTION ON YOUR GDP ON DEFENSE.
What is bokachoda India going to do now? Suck up to Russia s aggression.....
The only way the rest of the world can help is if China does the right thing. If that doesn’t happen there’s nothing we can really do outside of sanctions. Praying for all of the Ukrainians
That comedian President is now hiding. Nice laugh a real joke.
The international community  needs to put more pressure.Feel so sorry for the civilians.Just limping back from the covid attack and now putin attack.
This is a horrible sight. My heart goes out to the Ukrainian people. Stay strong!
Is it too late to tell Russian to stop the war with the condition that Ukraine will not be part of NATO ?  Russian is afraid of being surrounded by NATO members. It is too bad that US and Russian could not come to a peaceful conclusion.
Vladimir Putin is a wicked little man
Nato and america made disaster
How do russians feel that they are killing innocent civilians?

West is the cause of this destruction. You pushed Russian to advance because you cock wombles keep expanding nato base around their boarders
Yea let’s do that so gas prices will start at $10
If we do any fighting this will be the war to end all wars.
We see the Russians suffering. Americans have to deal with the same. Power hungry leaders who do what they want when it comes to making decision for the entire human race. Pray & keep positivity and optimism in your mindset.

What's the matter actually?
Snarling russian leader?bias rubbish media,rest of the world should stay out of it,  ukraine goverment are corrupt,,they are thugs,not a democracy
Dude @ 4:59 has it exactly right. Now that the West is turning into an sjw gynocracy ruled by a doddering puppet with dementia many contested regions will come into play with both Russia and China licking their lips.  As the world develops and attempts to become more touchy-feely friendly victim culture lowest common denominator inclusive oh, it must always be remembered that the instincts for Domination and war power and control don't just vanish in the midst of their cotton candy unicorn rainbow dreams. The warlord, the autocrat, The Dictator, the king et alia are, as Jung would've doubtlessly Affirmed, pernicious Collective unconscious archetypes which will undoubtedly be a part of The Human Experience forever.The point here is just because most of us crave a Kinder gentler world where we can just live in peace oh, it must not be forgotten that these archetypes of dominance hierarchies are always out there doing their thousand push-ups a day, flexing their muscles in the mirror, and awaiting their opportunity to manifest themselves. Therefore, unless we expect the ruthless repetition of History in terms of armed conflict and the surprise and shock everyone feels when brutality re-emerges, we must find ways for dominance hierarchies to be included within our society so that the one who aspires to be king or dictator or tyrant can be aimed to the proper ends of serving Society rather than becoming alienated from it and then wishing its destruction.Without a truly deep spiritual and psychological understanding of warrior culture and dominance archetypes, this class of archetype will always emerge and assert itself, especially when there is an attempt to Outlaw or vilify it. Simply put, this doesn't work with King/autocrat/dictators/warrior typesConclusion? Absent a reboot of our systems in general with a primary focus in truly understanding ourselves as a species i. E. A re focus of psychology, anthropology, the social sciences, endocrinology, genetics Etc towards the ends of a much deeper understanding of human personality then we have today, strong leadership and the election of dominant leaders in the Free World will always be important.  It doesn't matter if you like or don't like them, their rhetoric, Etc they are fundamentally necessary as a counterweight 2 Maniacs taking power.  Putin's actions are completely and totally a result of the election and installation of Biden as president of the United States.On the one hand, you have the leader of a nuclear power who's willing to get up on a horse with his shirt off and wave a sword in the air, and you think that a doddering old fool who can barely climb steps is an effective counter weight to this machismo? It will get worse before it gets better, mark my words. Chairman Xi will be the next one out of the gate and when that happens, not only say prayers for people in the South Pacific region but also for the balance of power in the entire world.
NATO: No Action Talks Only.
I want peace But where were the Westerners when it was middle East. Finally they accept it as invasion otherwise I was thinking of Bring Democracy
PLEASE READ THE HOLY QURAN FOR YOUR SELF
Putin has spoken only one great truth. The West is being 
Why goes china to taiwan at this moment?! And why is that news not comming online ?! Thats fake news from ukraine
There are two sides. And both sides have justifiable reasoning. Do not portray only half of the story
REVEALED IN THE HOLY QURAN
Damn terrorist. No better than Hitler. The world is just finding its feet after covid and now to deal with a pathetic tyrant imposing war. I hope the u.s. does to Putin what was done to bin laden and Saddam. He doesn't deserve to be in power.
He had no plan…..

The poor Syrian people were under these Russian attacks over the last 8 years.
The bully boy has gone mad. Time for NATO to send him packing.
This was all planned by the elites long ago.  This would have happened sooner if Trump hadn’t gotten in the way of the elites.  Better keep an eye on China now; won’t be surprised if they make some movement now

Putin has lost it. He’s got a gun to the world  daring them to save the ones he’s assaulting. It’s despicable, and clearly a global threat.
NATO will not help 😀
When will y’all listen to America yes we greedy but at least we let the world stage know what’s up
Iraq 2003......hypocrits
World of people must be with UKRAINE!!! ✨️✨️✨️
The west gave Ukrainians a false sense of security just to isolate and humiliate Russia as they have been doing with other former Soviet republics and allies since the fall of Soviet Union. When NATO bombed Serbia - Russia's closest ally - they could do nothing but timidly accept the western hegemony. Again when Poland and Czech joined NATO, Russia watched helplessly. Emboldened by this, the west started talking about welcoming Ukraine to NATO. That was the last straw for Russia.  Now what is Amerca's repsonse? Will they save Ukraine from Russian invasion ? Why  they put boots on Ukranian ? Will they defend Ukraine ? NO ! They know they wont and cant help Ukraine, but still keep provoking Russia and dont stop talking of welcoming Ukraine into NATO. idiots. I feel very sorry for Ukrainian though, but I hope they realize that it is never wise to count on western help against Russia. It just wont work
This Man think he owns World, God will pay you back for the innocent civilian your killing.
that's america!no wonder!they left you behind after you fall from there sweet tounge words!!
This is consequence of 4 years of bullshit and collusion under the GOP.
Oooh Jesus Christ have Mercy , Isaiah 54:17
We will not learn how to live together in peace by killing each other's children 💔💔💔
“Ideals are peaceful, history is violent.” It’s always the innocent that suffer in war. Prayers go out to the Ukrainian civilians.

Quite the philosopher aren’t you
Weird I'm watching that movie right now
 @Conor F  Better to think about how to make things better than to put people down. You're prob a bot so I'm just wasting my breath.
 @Conor F  I did serve for my country. Just pointing out that war is violent and that the innocent suffer. Arguing in the comments isn’t going to help them either.
 @Nick Myron  ya it’s a quote that always stuck with me. Great film
Where’s that quote from? Cuz idk if it applies here, there’s definitely some violent ideals at play here
 @Conor F  if happy clappy YouTube comments don’t help then what the fuck does your crying do to help anything?
Alright philosopher Brad! 😂
 @Ismael  it’s from Fury. I think it’s just metaphorical for indicating ideals in war always lead to violence.
 @Medad Leong  yeah I’ve been thinking about that sorry. Regards
In WW1: 1 out of 3 casualties were civilians.  In WW2: 2 out of 3 casualties were civilians. And now........?
Thoughts, prayers and ideals are useless if you don't have the means to make them heard. If you want to protect what you believe in you must be ready to fight and do so to win.
 @Medad Leong  ah interesting, thanks for sharing

incomplete translation...
The current Ukrainian government is corrupt as hell! They overthrew a democratically elected president which is a totally Nazi move. Our mainstream media isn't telling us both sides of the story.
Ненависть не подавляет ненависть
Whom will India help Ukraine or Russia
These westerners did worse in Iraq and afghan. Now they have war on their shores. Hypocrites. Even though they killed Muslims I don’t wish their innocents any harm.
Shame on Putin.......
Wtf is going on?
If Ukraine became a neutral country and had no ambition to join NATO, this Russian military attack would not have happened. For the sake of politics, sacrifice the people.
Hambog Yang BBC
NATO is setting up vaccination checkpoints at the border ...😨🤤
This breaks my heart! WHYYYYY???????
They hit the airport so that the civilians couldn’t flee 😔💔… close your eyes tight cry and wait for it to pass, God bless Ukraine 🇺🇦 and the guardian angels that watch over y’all
War is horrible.
Ukrainian, This is what happens when you elect foolish person as your President, now enjoy a fight out with Putin.
putin is a murderer arrest putin
Rip putin
India want help the holy cows around the world
No, it’s so that foreign airforces can’t be deployed to Ukraine. This is rudimentary military doctrine.
 @Олександр Колада : Would agree, while the outcome may be that civilians can't get away, the motivation very likely wasn't, more likely it's to make it harder to attack/defend. Not that it's what I support, of course!
 @Олександр Колада  doesn’t Ukraine have its own military airbases? Why attack civilian airports?
 @Indrid Cold  you attack all airfields.
 @Indrid Cold  I believe it was a military airport and not a civilian airport. I suggest you look into it because certain images and video footage are looking a little suspect.
You can go arrest him first, I won't hold you down. 🤣🤣
 @wallace  he is keyboard warrior
 @giovanni giorgio  He thinks all he has to do is ask his mother to arrest Putin. 🤣🤣
Reason is: USA with all that politic,greed and lust..USA good in trapping others..Public are innocent
Russia,  U.S, UK Israel, same shite different day!
This is heart wrenching 💔 😢 😞 my prayers are with all of the people 🙏 💔 in Ukraine 🇺🇦 🙏
We must all pray together that God will help and protect the people there🙏
Every civilian-we don’t want war. Old farts that won’t be anywhere near the front line- yeah we want war
BUY LOCKHEAD MARTIN STOCK!
This is not what civilians wanted. Please think about them. They lost home, family, and future. This is so heartbraking to watch.My prayers towards all Ukrainians.
Sad thing is that everyone knew what the master of repression, lies and doing anything to save his Oligarchy/Dictatorship would do 🙄 Ukrainians have once again fallen victim to Russia, by Stalin 2.0.🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦✌🏽
My prayers for Ukraine
Ukranian Conan: Crom, I have never prayed to you before. I have no tongue for it. No one, not even you, will remember if we were good men or bad. Why we fought, or why we died. All that matters is that two stood against many. That's what's important! Valor pleases you, Crom... so grant me one request. Grant me revenge! And if you do not listen, then the HELL with you!
BBC is British propoganda factory
Spare our coutry please
Awesome! Ukraine’s been committing genocide since 2014!
That's the price the Ukraine has to pay for a terrible NATO expansion against the agreement of 1994. But Putin is protecting the russian-security-sphere.Quick action of the russian army will end soon. The anglistic reporters are again......war-mongers.
Poke the bear you get what you ask for!!!! Fxxk nato England
It shows that I put in is of his father the devil the devil was a liar from the beginning and he loves lies cuz he's a deceiver and being deceived himself and that's the way put in his right now but that's all right God has everything under control he's watching over everything prophecy is here the word of God is going forth and it will not come back void Jesus is coming soon so turn to him now while you can with a true broken and contrite heart he will not despise
If World War 3 happens, this proved that UN is useless.
talk is cheap
All of this because of false flag operations and the mere fact that an independent country having an army is being considered a threat to Putin. (No, Ukraine was not going to join NATO any time in the next 10 years at least , but now thanks to this attack they might)My heart goes to the people of Ukraine that didn't ask for any of this and just want to be free to live their lifes without fear. I don't know about our government, but the Brazilian people stand with you.
EVO DOSAO JE CAS DA SE KOSOVO I METOHIJA VRATE U NASE RUKE,NMZ NATO I AMERI NA SVE STRANE DA RATUJU. SAPO ROKAJ PUTINE. POZDRAV IZ CRNE GORE,CRNJE DA CRNJA NE MOZE BITI
They’re never gonna listen. Innocent lives don’t matter when it comes to conflict between countries.
Nobody lost their home. Don't be silly. Just a few bombs on military strategic objects.
Nobody cares about us or you or your silly family. You are a nobody in a comments section. Our lives DO. NOT. MATTER.It would be best to get that through your head.
 @Bill AndTed  very nihilism view I see….
 @Jay Bomb  Welcome to reality. Your fantasy crap isnt doing anyone any favors.
 @Michał G  there's already footage of apartment buildings that caught fire... Also it's insane to think civilians won't be killed or homes won't be destroyed during this.
 @Bill AndTed  what “fantasy” I didn’t remember bringing any fantasy? Lol
https://youtu.be/VDu3w1DqGhw
 @Michał G  ah yes, war - That thing that famously  never hurts innocent people or destroys their homes.
They begged Putin to protect them from Nazism, the Ukrainian army destroyed the Donbass, and the UK just sat and watched it. The whole eastern Ukraine was looking forward to the arrival of the Russian army, not a single civilian will suffer, do not worry. Just Nazism will end.
 @Jay Bomb  your view is the fantasy
Hold on, you're telling me the civilians didn't want to get exploded into pink mist in the streets? Who would have thought. I guess war is a bad thing after all.
 @Jay Bomb  This is stupidity. Ukrainians are the same Russian people, most Russians have families, parents, brothers and sisters living there. No one will allow the suffering of a peaceful people.
when israel, turkey and the united states bomb the syrian army that fights against terrorists nobody said anything but now that russia bombs military bases in ukraine everyone gets angry and annoyed, damn weak brains
 @SkyPrince  What about the civils that are already killed
Якби я був прем’єр-міністром, то незабаром би ввів жорсткі санкції проти Росії, але Японія зараз цього не робить. Я був дуже розчарований. Дуже боляче, що я можу лише побажати твого спокою. Будь ласка, переконайтеся, що ви вижили. Неродним людям боляче гинути на війні.Yakby ya buv premʺyer-ministrom, to nezabarom by vviv zhorstki sanktsiyi proty Rosiyi, ale Yaponiya zaraz tsʹoho ne robytʹ. YA buv duzhe rozcharovanyy. Duzhe bolyache, shcho ya mozhu lyshe pobazhaty tvoho spokoyu. Budʹ laska, perekonaytesya, shcho vy vyzhyly. Nerodnym lyudyam bolyache hynuty na viyni.
 @SkyPrince  what do you know about nazism?  Putin told you stupid things and you keep repeating this load of nonsense.
 @Forastero  Civilians were killed by the army of Ukraine for 8 years. The Russian army is now clearing the Donbass from the Ukrainian army. Not to which Kiev, as they say on the CNN, the Russian army has not yet reached. And missiles in Russia are very accurate.
 @Ghui Larov  My relatives, like those of other Russians, live in Ukraine. I know how they were intimidated by the new government. Putin does not decide anything in Russia, he did not want this war at all, but the people of Ukraine and Russia demanded that he send troops. Do you communicate with Ukrainians at all? At least go to their chats, they will tell you who Zelensky is.

It ain't no Utopia he will strike anyone. 🙏🏽 #Ukraine https://youtu.be/OAaZRJ8_9rQ
Russia loves to kill civilians, it has been like this throughout history.
 @Michał G  your either extremely blind or wilfully ignorant
 @Michał G  thousands have been displaced from their homes.
 @SkyPrince  don't write such nonsense.  first you write about Naziism which affects Russians in Ukraine.  Tell me how the Ukrainian government distinguishes Ukrainians from Russians and treats the latter in a worse way.  This is what you write to you is a typical Kremlin narrative for disinforcement.
 @SkyPrince  They are literally bombing Kiev right now, Russian paratroopers have just taken the airport 25 km south of Kiev. Armored forces had cross the north border with Bielorrusia heading to Kiev, not the Donbass. And btw, you're don't know nothing if you think Russian bombs are very accurate, damn they are already killing civis, just watch the video damn and educate yourself You simply are plainly wrong, and all what I said is public info
Syria,Lebanon,Jordan,Iran, Irak, Palestinian, Egypt, Turkey, Afganistan and many more
 @Ghui Larov  Chat with Ukrainians and you will find out. Watch the news, how Zelensky threatened Russian nuclear weapons. Ukraine will always be our people and we will always come to their aid.
Russia and Belarus have carried out a hybrid attack on the borders of Lithuania and Poland in recent months.  I am to understand that it is all because of the bad situation of Russians in Ukraine.
 @Ghui Larov  Nazism? 15,000 of its people in the Donbass were destroyed by the Ukrainian army. Isn't that Nazism?
 @Forastero  Nobody is bombing Kiev, there is not a single video of the bombing of Kiev yet. Or do you think that the inhabitants of Kiev do not have phones with a video camera?
When do the warmongering generals ever do what the civilians want?????
 @Forastero  No one will ever kill their parents, brothers and sisters. Just remember it. Ukraine, Russia and Belarus are one nation.
 @SkyPrince  your point of view is not funny but frightening and shows what propaganda does to human perception.  first, where would the president of Ukraine get nuclear weapons from?  Secondly, do you know that a nuclear bomb attack on Russia would be met with a counterattack and the destruction of Ukraine? (Only a man with no calculations like Putin could do it).
there's no point in appealing to Russian morality, unevolved knuckle draggers.
 @SkyPrince  ok now we know u are only russian troll
 @Ghui Larov  He wanted to create nuclear weapons, in Ukraine there was nuclear production from the USSR. The threat of nuclear weapons was the last straw for Putin. Do you read the news at all? Go to sites with the UA domain.
Yes. Prayers! A-men!
 @Ghui Larov  Think what you want. I do not care. I just came to read the comments. I read the news in all languages and keep abreast of world events. The Germans are great in this regard.
 @SkyPrince  okay, an atomic bomb would be useful to Ukraine because they have a dangerous country at their border.  I fully support the construction of an atomic bomb for Ukraine.  unfortunately, it is too late and Putin will kill the civilian population.
 @SkyPrince  the Ukrainians i have spoken to were definitely not begging putin to invade
USA government told the world they realized a 
Civilians can either pick up a rifle or run. Honestly neighboring countries should take the kids and elderly and hand the parents rifles.
 @SkyPrince  if Russia's missiles are 
Blame on the US
Compare this to the 2003 Iraq aerial bombing of Iraqi cities and you'll notice bombs were landing everywhere at the background, at the left, at the right, and at the center. In these videos it's only at a specific spot and far background. Watching the MSM is very dangerous.
 @SkyPrince  i think you have good news from russia today and sputnik.  you are well informed.  You see the world you want to see.
 @Moikle  Go to Telegram channels, go to Discord channels and chat again. I communicate with my family the same way.
 @S117 SSJ3  Civilians don't suffer there. There are no videos from the phone yet.P.S. Ukrainians have phones with video cameras 😉
 @SkyPrince  There are plenty of videos of the bombings in Kiev, all the ones I saw are from civies, you are just a troll
 @Forastero  Give a link.
 @Moikle  There is no evidence of this, except for news from CNN.
Yeah cuz Russia is in this comment section giving a fuck about what we think
 @Michał G  yet
 @SkyPrince  liar
Ukrofascists asked for this, now they reap they whirlwind. This will be quick, Ukraine will likely return to better days of pre collapse days white in a year. This is the way.
Putin doesn’t care
 @SkyPrince  as a Black American I can see that Russia is more righteous than America. Nato, the same organization that ignores 3rd world countries and enslaves humans and put profit over life vs Russia which has been more righteous in my opinion. What can Russia do with immigrants from all backgrounds?
 @SkyPrince  propaganda at its finest.    No Former soviel republic wants to be Part of that horrible shithole called russia
Firstly, let's all be honest. None of you knew anything about the Ukraine or its political landscape until five seconds ago.rrSecondly, the political scene in the Ukraine has been dominated by Far Right/White Supremacist groups like Svoboda and corrupt foreign business elements (Like the Biden's) syphoning off millions of dollars, for years. The Ukraine has been a failed state for some time, like a rotten apple, it looked good on the outside, but was black and toxic in the middle.rrLastly, Putin is fighting Fascism and Neo Nazism - so if you stand against Russia but for the Ukraine, then you are supporting White Supremacy and Neo Nazism in the Ukraine. I thought we were against White Supremacy?
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
What about the hundreds of thousands of civilians that the u.s k!lled in airstrikes in Iraq Afghanistan ect.
 @Angela Bronckhurst  So you support the rise of the Soviet Union.
 @Spiritual Knight  I didn't understand the question, probably due to google translate. Russia is a multinational country, we have a lot of migrants from different countries, we have always respected and respect all nations. The only thing we frankly do not like is the US government, it does everything to sell weapons to anyone, for its own wealth.
@UCa3HiMFDL_YyWFjzDf7bLCQ Bullshit you mouthpiece
Lol did any body give a fuck when the Western and its allies destroyed Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, Syria  Palestine
August, pls pray also for the people in Donbas region, they too have suffered much. Dont be so bias even in your prayers.
 @Doğan Gürbüz How many civilians died evry time US drones strikes? You are either blind or bias. 😊
It's  a war
This is how Palestinians feel every day and have been for decades, America is funding and supporting Isreal while they do the same thing to Palestinians.
 @Prometheus Venom  I'm against fascism and White supremacy, Putin is against white supremacy and fascism in the Ukraine. So, surely that makes us natural allies. Do you support Ukrainian fascism and white supremacy?
Strength only matters to those who want power. They'll toss their children in a meat grinder for power. Power minds.
 @Zain Junkeer  I'm against fascism and White supremacy, Putin is against white supremacy and fascism in the Ukraine. So, surely that makes us natural allies. rrDo you support Ukrainian fascism and white supremacy?
 @Bill AndTed  then why are you writing.
​ @Jay Bomb  in one comment you say innocent lives don't matter when it comes to conflict then you say nihilism view to someone who's saying the same thing but in other words , he's trying to tell you that the internet won't save you just stop being soft
We want war are you talking about
It's ok. Bring them to America give their own ukrainetown in sanfransico
They didn't want this? Then whyve they been in a perpetual state of war for the last eight years... Think about it, dumb dumb.
 @SkyPrince  as a US citizen many of us know how corrupt the US is and its mainly because of greedy evil politicians that believe in their own system
 @Julwiez de Ghorz  Prayers don't work, please grow up
GET THEM RUSSIA !!
 @SkyPrince  there is footage of it from the BBC, and I know someone who lives there
 @Forastero  this war has been cooking for over a month. Everyobe knew war was coming since no one wanted to compromise with Russia. Why didn't they evacuate the civilians when there was high risk of war if they care so much about their fate ?
Вы, наверное, в параллельной какой-то вселенной живёте...это угнетаемые украинской армией уже 8 лет жители Донбасса  остались без жилья, без воды и живут в подвалах бывших домов.После того, как украинская власть отказалась перестать обстреливать Донбасс(юго-восток Украины) и отказалась от всех договорённостей по мирному урегулированию(Минские соглашения), жители Донбасса попросили Россию защитить их от геноцида со стороны националистических батальонов и украинской армии.   И сегодня, наконец, Россия решила помочь, несмотря на агрессивный западный мир, которому было плевать на жизни людей и на нацистские зверства.   Мы, народ России, понимаем, что западные страны теперь набросятся на нас и будут душить всеми доступными нечестными способами.  Но мы поддерживаем миротворца Путина - другого выбора не было спасти людей - западные страны не оставили выбора(к тому же президент Украины Зеленский недавно грозился сделать атомную бомбу, чтобы угрожать нам) .Прошу заметить, что Россия атакует только военные объекты  высокоточным оружием!  А  пленённых украинских военных разоружает и отправляет домой.И кстати..🤔🤔  где Вы были и что чувствовали, когда силы НАТО  бомбили Югославию из всех видов запрещённого вооружения  по школам, больницам, электростанциям и многоэтажным домам простых жителей?????  Лицемеры 😤
 @Michał G  actually civilian of Donbas do want this happens because they want independence and NATO didn't let them
 @俺は悟空でお前はゴジータだ。  Hiroshima ? Nagasaki ? The US made slaves of the once proud Japanese people . Shame on you .
 @SkyPrince  i have been
Please tell me the percentage of civilians that aren’t living in a desert that EVER want war. Such a dumb statement, only mainstream media would say something that stupid. It’s literally 100% misleading. Figure it out!!
 @Angela Bronckhurst  I’m no ally of the Soviet Union or Russia. And I’m no ally for tyranny Ukraine is a lot of things but you know that Putin attacked an innocent country out of greed. I’m an ally of democracy I support Ukraine right of freedom and independence. 🇺🇸🇺🇦.
 @Michał G  possibly the dumbest comment about war I have ever read. You are a dumb ass dude.
 @SkyPrince  Ukraine doesn't have nuclear weapons you brainwashed dummy
 @Prometheus Venom  but you don't support freedom and independence for Donesk and Lugansk . Damn your sooo stpid .
News flash , politicians , presidents , prime ministers don’t give a single FUCK about any ordinary folk like all of us . There care about money and power it’s just not that hard to see
 @SkyPrince  they have already killed Ukrainians. Including a child. Russia is a murderer.
 @Julwiez de Ghorz  Show me proof which country are you from?
 @Cerilio Vrolijk  So you’re putting words and fabrications in my mouth Pillock?
 @Forastero  Ваша публичная информация снята»Белыми касками»
It's gna happen regardless already has! Putin does not care of comments. Love from New Zealand 🇳🇿
 @SkyPrince  what a load of absolute bull shit!!!!
 @SkyPrince  more Russian propaganda bs
 @Andrew W  You can say anything. You can call Russia stupid barbarians who would just fight. Nothing has changed in 1000 years, we all know that. Anyway, in a couple of months everyone will be shouting that Putin did in a month what NATO could not do in 8 years. Everything will be like in Georgia. Like any Russian-Ukrainian, I am categorically against genocide and support the decision of the government and the federation council, which forced Putin to take this step.I advise you to communicate with people from Ukraine and Russia, then you will be aware of the situation. Ukraine has a domain - Ua, Russia has a domain - Ru. I hope you know that the Internet is not limited to the COM domain.
 @Andrew W  Here explain to me from your point of view. I just do not understand. 8 hours ago, the Ukrainian government screamed that Russia had started bombing Kiev. People began to gather and run, all ATMs and gas stations immediately became empty. Now the Ukrainian government is saying that Russia did not attack Kiev and everyone should return home and not run away. What is the logic?
 @Andrew W  I don’t think Skyprince has a mind of his own, his pimp ex kgb Putin thinks for him.
Does your prayers include the ethnic russians in Donbass (Ukraine) that have been fired at for 8 years by the ukrainian army and slowly starved to death by cutting power, water, food supplies, financial services? Of course western media did not report about that, but it's the hard reality on the ground.
 @SkyPrince  https://youtu.be/9YwmUD0ujhI there's one link. You can check out R/ukraine and find videos of missile strikes in action. There's even a video of someone with their legs blown off. You can see them try to get up after they were hit. They suffered and the missile didn't even hit it's target. Just a civilian. Or the video of them shooting a missile at residential homes and hear children  screaming in fear. Ignorance isn't cute. Be ashamed of yourself,
 @SkyPrince  Guys he is a troll. Just ignore.
 @HiTRap  I said innocent lives don’t matter TO the people doing the conflict….you really think war is gonna stop shooting at each other and causing damage?
 @SkyPrince  So if most people in Ukraine agrees with Putin... Why are they not driving east to donbass but actually driving west to get as close to Nato allies border as possible???? The seperatist called for Putin assistance.... Where they are is still apart of Ukraine.... So why shouldn't they fight to keep their country together. Putin recognised the seperatist regions.... Then invaded Ukraine under the pretence of keeping peace.... So flying about bombing the place and getting civilians caught in the mess is justified???? This is an invasion and if Ukraine don't agree to Putin terms thats it! This was the goal from day one... To get Ukraine fully under his control.... Do you need someone to state the truth to you in a different language.....??? Nazi eradication my ass.... Isn't Ukraine pres... Jewish.
You should do something maybe you should join Ukrainian army instead your fake sympathy and sweet words 🤡
This man has outlived his usefulness. He must be held accountable
Russian people, you are responsible for this! There is no excuse!
Civilian lives must be protected and all efforts must be made to stop the war.
If World War 3 happens, this proved that UN is useless.
Putin is the Devil himself
These are the end of days stay strong in christ people
Ukrainian refugees are welcome in the free world.  The free world will also support the ukrainian guerrilla forever. They will never lack money or weapons. Russian tourists are advised to go to China. Do not visit the free world. My only concern here is your safety.
Invades Ukraine..... Putin 
The absolute madness of the human ego.
Ukraine can thank usa and nato for this provocation
Where are all the Javelin missiles that the US gave Ukraine? Why aren't more tanks getting blown up as they cross into their invasion?
BBC should state the truth instead of more Jackanory stories!
if Russians was a Muslim country the west would have intercepted
What happened to those civilians training to defend the country looks like when they get hit with reality everyone backs up
who agenda is this?who will be benefited from this war?
Since this illegal president Mr potato Head has come in the office he has reflected weakness throughout the world as in Afghanistan and it just gave a green light to China and Russia to take territories that they want you voted for Mr potato Head you made your bed now lie in it

There will not happen any world war. Russian army will easily conquer ukraine . America is just a joker..only talks no work 😂
Это ужас, везде бомбят. Уже и мирных жителей обстреливают .
Lesson is dont mess up with your neighbor.
America was not safe from Iraq. Same way Russia justified not safe from Ukraine.
Rusputin is really out of control.
The REAL Reason Putin is Invading Ukrainehttps://youtu.be/LJNtfyq3TDE
Guy at 5:20 ''well it will be like another Nazi occupation'' needs to read the history of his own country, the Nazis were welcomed into Ukraine and many Ukrainians collaborated and worked as concentration camp guards. Fact.
Western Propaganda shit.
Get ready for war
America is responsible for all this mess..
It's what the USA and UK do all of the time, double standards, Afghanistan, Iraq (weapons of mass destruction that never existed), Libya, Yemen (UK are right now selling arms to the KSA), and much more, always okay for them to murder civilians but not when it's Russia. Okay for them to test nukes but not Russia or for Iran to have a nuke or two, Israel has plenty and yet just like the West constantly behaves like spoilt children reacting to someone else doing exactly what they seem to do best, murder innocent people in illegal wars. So after two years of BS and fear mongering about a flu virus which through 'measures' ruined so many lives it made politicians millions in profit; and we now have this fear mongering, and a good divert away from the 'virus'. It's fine, look the other way, next you'll have China invade Taiwan. Read Matthew 24:6 in the Bible where it reads: And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.
Stay safe and strong! 🇸🇰🇺🇦

When serbia did even more horrible things in croatia bosnia and especially Kosova...ukraine used to send war helicopters to help serbia killing croatian bosnian ans albanian civilians. What did ukraine thinking when they helped the russians closest allies named serbia?? Ask serbia back now for those arms u sent to them since as wellknown serbia are supporting russia and dident even care to condem the russian agression on ukraine. And the irony is that ukrainian ambasador in serbia still saying that they support serbia against Kosova???!!!! It doesent make any sence. Wake up ukraine eventhough its very late. However Kosovas goverment and itspeople supporting and standing in ukraines side of course.  Fuck of russia
Shame on Russian People and Army... Stop it...Save humanity
Wow those Russians are really against the war, all four of them! This will turn the tide at home for sure!
My heart goes out to all the Russian soldiers who will die because of western lies.
How can that man sleep at night with all that blood on his hands ? what a monster.. I’m really sorry for all those innocent persons
To be America's enemy is dangerous but to be America's friend is fatal! - Henry Kissinger
All in self defense? I think that someone should explain the definition of self defense to Putin. And NATO countries should be ashamed of themselves for abandoning Ukraine since it’s their fault that this is happening.
When US had a explanation then , Russia has one now . Only the civilians are at stake
Servizio politicamente scorretto... influenza americana...
Why don't we let politicians who want war fight in a ring or an arena with another politicians who want the same, and leave the civilians alone to go to work, raise their children, take care of their family etc. It easy to be reckless with another human life, isn't it... smh 😔
May God bless the blind greedy leader of this world!..
Now USA and NATO is trapped...
i pray for a russian victory
We are praying for the people of Ukraine from Portugal

Belarus has been secretly contributing to all the bad things in the world
WHO can save Ukraine no body except Pres Putin ..He warning anybody interfer goes to not looking before
The world never reacted this way when America was going around waging war on middle east.
Very true
BBC you guys are a bullet weapon programmed to help one side always. hard to believe anything you suggest. we will wait updates from neutral news bureaus and Russia itself.
Bad Putin! Please stop the war.Contentment is better than riches.
God help all innocent people and children.
Send an email to the Russian Embassy in your country and tell them to get out of Ukraine.rDo it in the language of your country.rBe factual and not childish!
That's right! We Russians don't want war. It is Putin and the oligarchs who need a war. And we are silent because we are afraid ourselves. We are afraid for ourselves and for our loved ones. The whole world saw how they tried to poison Navalny. Now imagine what they can do to us, ordinary people, if we open our mouths.
Does he hear himself? Denatzification? Man has clearly gone baluba.Credit to western Powers for predicting an invasion I think Biden said it would happen last wedensday? Maybe he read it wrong or forgot?🤔 Anyway wedensday was right.

Ukrainians&Russians have no clue why this is happening, God protect the people.DO YOUR RESEARCH! This is all about Good vs. Evil. Dark ones want your souls. AWAKEN HUMANS! Putin understands what's really happening. This way goes back for THOUSANDS of years!
Absolute idiot, the world's gone through a massive pandemic, now you want to destroy a country, it's all right for people like him in his ivory castle, it's the mass population as usual that pay the price for nothing but power and greed. Money and greed as always.
Very devilish act of agression on peaceful and democratic Ukraine. The whole world is with Ukraine.Watch how God  works. The aggressor is going to pay a hefty price. An attack on Ukraine is an attack to all democratic nations.
The Ukrainian troops are scared I would be to fighting a world power such as Russia
Never believe a Russian Leader who was in the KGB
Looking at the comments why don’t people say anything when America and nato invade other countries.As if it’s fine when they do it.Not saying it is right in any case
In a war nobody wins. Look at the russian civilians. Most of them even don‘t a war with ukraine. Prays from Hong Kong🇭🇰
when that missile hit, not one of them in the shot jumped and even seemed bothered.. I will wait for actual camera phone footage comes out direct from the people....we know how media works,,, IF THERE AINT MULTI ANGLES of the footage WE NOT BELIEVING IT - How you say....

As human this is very terrifying for me my heart goes out innocent Ukrainian people stay safe, stong. As well such greedy leaders will destory this earth so now we need work together for Peace and better future of our comming generations.
Im praying for these wars to end!!
Well done Putin, standing up for his own people, the Americans said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and killed thousands. What is the difference at least Putin warned everyone before hand
If the rest of the world doesn't intervene soon then I'm afraid Russia will completely take over Ukraine in two days.
NATO is evil
They're murderers.. under the guise of war.
Now he's playing the victim! Sick man
British and American armed actual Nazis attacked Donbas. This is the result
what Nato did in Afghanistan iraq Syria?  Go forward Putin. God bless u. Destroy zionist hand.
Man Putin s name In Portuguese is almost hilarious because of its actions now (only Portuguese speakers no matter the accent will understand this)
Hearts for Ukraine and no hate for those killing them? You people are useless liers.

Russia is evil. Not NATO. NATO is tying to save us
Didn't school teach you proper grammar?
unfortunately no, they only teach proper tiktok dancing these days
Let’s pray 🙏 for Ukraine 🇺🇦
There is a lesson to be learned from this incident.  Never trust anyone.  You should look after your own security. What does Ukraine need to join NATO? When there was no need to help, what was the need to pretend Europe and America to prepare troops in the border countries.
Lol everyone thinks its gonna cause a world war. But the rest of the world turned their backs on ukraine when this happened. Like those 2 said, where are NATO to help them?
Yeah where the frack is NATO? Sanctions you shitting me
Fake news! This is disinformation plain and simple!
Oh my!!!! This is no good. I send my prayers, there is no reason for any of this.
And where is the United Nations in all of this, completely useless.
So Putin is threatening the world now?

ukranians are tough and determined people, they won’t let this slide easily.
I lived throughout the bombing of Baghdad by the Americans and I know how it feels!  This is nothing in comparison to the inhuman killing of women and children on the streets!! BBC Please don't take the high moral ground..
Screw Russia.
Who’s ready to built underground vault
Do you think Iraq wanted to be liberated by the United States, It was an invasion and I did not hear you guy say shit. Now you bark at Putin but where were you while the U.S destroyed Iraq, Bombed and invaded Afghanistan and destroyed their own New york towers to have an excuse to atack the middle east and you punk didnt say shit. NATO wants to invade Russia along with the U.S and Russia deffends themselfs and you start talking shit. STOP BEING FAKE AND SAY THE TRUTH ABOUT WHAT IT IS HAPPENNING.!!!!!
Where are your friends now? You should have known by now they will leave you stranded. It's not their first and it won't be their last either.
Don’t worry the US is on y’all’s side!❤️we stay on Ukraine’s side!!
ZIJELA rusija idemoooo
NATO N the US have no b@lls... Good job Russia!

Think what NATO and US did with Muslims in Afghanistan, Iraq, and other Muslim countries and the time will repeat and Russian doing good in Ukraine.......
Don't forget Trump and Putin alliance https://youtu.be/Pj6ntv8kirY All he did was gain insight for years! Fake alliance with NATO. He's a snake and a tyrant!
May Allah bless the Ukraine people 🤲🤲🤲
I am just starting to hate Putin. My prayers for Ukraine 🇺🇦 people
There is a reason why it happened now … a very weak and inefficient scarecrow of a president … we could not tolerate Russian  missiles in Cuba … nato should’ve stayed out,
A counter attack on Moscow is the only way to stop Putin now. An immediate retaliation by democratic countries is the only way to stop Putin. These delays are putting all of Europe in peril.
Innalillahi
It seems like Putin wants to enslave about 40 million people in Ukraine.
If I was Russia I would easily take Poland and Romania next. Especially if we are just going to talk about it on TV until they come for us.

So let's sit back and let the rabid dog bite everyone in the neighborhood and do nothing! Sanctions only work when the people that care about being Sanctioned actually care. SMH  disgusting
BBC... fake news🤣🤣🤣
There are mad men running this world.
Why didn't the premier of Ukraine just surrender and leave the citizens unharmed?? 😒 you know it's always this 
For weeks you were told to leave weeks ago. Idk why some people waits till the last minute.

Many Ukrainians civilians will end up as refugees in Britain and the USA
God damn Biden. Wtf his he doing to our country? Another war we are butting into but this time it hit way close to home. My first born son is involved in this shit show of a mess. We have to really wonder why crack head hunter can't defend his crack head dad's bs agenda
Love Russia from Bangladesh 🇧🇩
Good job. Mr. Putin. No NATO, at your  door steps. God Bless  Putin & Russia.
Russia have the right to protect itself from others
We are all people of the same race. Why are we divided between nations? If human lives are lost, we can not get it back. We can get expensive cars and houses back, to prevent the destruction of innocent people in wars like this.  Please stop this war.
Where is NATO???
I feel like a coward just sitting at home watching this happening to another European nation. Remember the words of Jesus Christ: Nobody have greater love then those that give their lives for their friends. Blessings and prayers. <3 From the northern front of NATO, Alv, Norway.
Fuck the people who wrote here sympathy to Ukrainian go and give pressure your government to support Ukrainian for this unjustified war
Me too. That's why we as people do not really like wars otherwise we lose peace in the world where we want to create love, honesty, trust, hope, happiness, goodness, etc with other people as well as families and friends.
Why would you attack civilian homes, Putin?
Glory to Russia 🇷🇺come back winning 🤞🏽hoping for the situation to de-escalate quickly 🇺🇦❤️
And now we sit and wait to see how long it takes for the world governments against this to grow a pair and respond with force
Peace please !!
Ukraine should've taken all it civilians way from the war front . Other country's keep there nose 👃 out . Or do we want world war 3 ?
Putin has every right to move. NATO promised that they would never move forces an inch to the east, but over the years they have surrounded Russia and now want to make Ukraine a NATO country right on Russia's doorstep. Besides that Russian people have faced genocide and torture in the Ukraine. But never mind that...the BBC propaganda will never mention this. Go Russia. The western leaders have zero support from the public they opress.
NUKE MOSCOW!!!!!!
Where are so called Great friends  Ukraine... Neither NATO, USA, UN, EUROPE UNION has come to help these innocent people.. What a pity..
just show that cia intels are reliable and puttin does not have word of honor

We are with you 🇮🇳🇮🇳
If u call this an invasion, US and UN invaded Korea in 1948 by executing South only election which effectively divided the country  into two leading to the war in only two years. Also please note the prominent leader who opposed division was assassinated by US CIA. These are all facts. Rewrite history.

1 Corinthians 15:26-30 (KJV)  The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him.And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?
We need to help them the movie war games this is not a game it’s gonna go on and on new world order world war3
It will be a war against the Global Elites jewelry, who control and behind every aspect of the whole world, using NATO to occupy Ukraine, as They used the Northern Europeans Crusaders to try and take back Jerusalem. They are expert Saboteurs of nations to none of which are They loyal, only to Their Prophets and Profits; That will be the Backlash when the World will finally wake up.

Yeah, thier still state propoganda, and they wanted this, they needed a show and something to re-legitemize themselves in the hearts and minds of people.

One of the best things the west could/could've done to help Ukraine is deploy thousands of video drones to document what Putin is doing. Russia is banking on the old school 
For 30 years we have seen US going to war on tv,  now it’s Russia’s turn
Europe is in total shock! Prayers to ukraine 🇪🇺❤🇺🇦
Cant blame russia to stop protests, as a Canadian, our leaders are worst, the destruction of Libya and Trudeau crushing freedom protest are good examples
Human is the most dangerous thing ever in the world.
fuck you Russia!!!!!
Putin is a coward and the lowest form of a human being.He's also full of self loathing and fear, which is textbook for, 
Welcome to BBC brainwasher
God protect Ukraine

Lier BBC....Talk something about NATO's expansion which.is main cause of war..!
No 🇳🇵🤝🇨🇳🤝🇷🇺
Exactly! I believe they send in some old hardware in first to test the waters and see if any western reaction comes. They'll definitely ramp things up soon
There are no secrets to success. It is the result of preparation, hard work, and learning from failure.
Disgusting evil human
This is a horrible sight. Hope everyone is dafe and my heart goes out to the civilians. 😭❤️
So much for nato What are sanctions going to achieve nothing You think putin cares not 1 bit We have to fight russia simplePutin is an arrogant person he needs to be put down
it’s invasion… probably other countries are starting to flex their army as well…
Only putin wants a war, cause he is too old a doesn't care about the world and his people, he is now playing like a child with plastic toy soldiers.
okay... We're Fucked up
THE LORD ALSO SAID:NKJV, Matthew 24:8All these are the beginning of sorrows.

their is no body to help you the Americans created this mess they playing with lives of ordinary people don't expect no body to help you only American words  they put the fire and they talking about sanction that's BL
Yes ; if I had some wise words for Ukrainians in the military it's this.  Don't allow yourselves to become puppets and stooges and fall guys for the west ; particularly the illegally elected clown squatting in the White House.  They are using you as pawns in a vicious chess game as Mr Putin knows well. They want their nukes on your land.  Refuse to pick up their dirty arms and weapons that the corrupt Biden regime as slush funded your way. Show the corrupt one in the White House the  ultimate contempt and lay down your arms and welcome Mr Putin. Don't listen to the West's urging and goadings offering their useless support ; for you WILL die.  And ; nuclear war is on the cards.  Don't let yourselves become complicit with world destruction.
Please stop this war
This so called Putin is pure evil.This is just sad and ruined my day.My heart goes out to the people of Ukraine.
Lamentablemente creo que la OTAN lo esta obligando a tener que moverse.

Putins denazification in Ukraine
BBC stop pumping lies over the internet
They need to systematically shoot out the tires of those tanks.
It's russian fighting russians. Ukrain say where not russia but 50% of population is. Ukrain ignorance to say im not russia. Ussr.Was all russians  your blood is russian.. sad 😔
The leaders of Russia, Ukraine and every country involved should deal with this themselves, harming innocent people is not the way
Must nations be seduced into NATO and EU? Germany and France will never allow these former Soviet States to grow economically.
This isn’t war! It’s terrorism!!!
Omg hope this won't degenerate  and Russian and Ukraine find a way to peace soon 😔
There is a very simple reason that this terrible military intervention is happening in 2022 and why countless more innocent people are suffering: when the USSR dissolved and the Cold War effectively ended, instead of trying to work alongside the new defacto Russian state and its new government on mutual security and growth for the 21st Century, certain war mongering hawks inside of the Bush/Clinton administrations (e.g. John Bolton) and the UK too advocated for further eastward expansion of NATO, despite there not being the need for it. The famed architect of the cold war policy of containment of the USSR, George Kennan, warned in 1997 of what would happen if NATO continued with eastward expansion. He predicted that:“It would inflame nationalistic, anti-western and militaristic tendencies in Russian opinion”, “have an adverse effect on the development of Russian democracy”, “restore the atmosphere of cold war to east-west relations”, and “impel Russian foreign policy in directions decidedly not to our liking”.If the nations of Ireland and Mexico had historically been part of Russia for hundreds of years, sharing cultural and economic ties and a shared heritage, what would the UK and US do if both of those nations aspired to join a 
Why cant peace be an option?
Why the Uncranian army doesn't send missiles directly to the Kremlin? that will make the Russian people wake up and start opposing the Putin war, if Russian people feel that Putin's action makes then to be in danger, they will revel against Putin.
So the world acts like this for EU country’s but when uk , USA and Russia and Israel bullied  Iran , Iraq , Palestinian and yaman
Ukraine has secrets and this seems like a FALSE FLAG event! To destroy evidence of some sort. My Opinion
We stand with Ukraine...
Is peace really too much to ask for, these human beings are given so much power, why do these civilians, innocent people have to pay the price for these people in power, why do we have to end our lives short for their bigotry? It isn’t fair to us.
Wait a minute 2 factions in Ukraine are Pro Russia? What nonsense is this reporter saying. Stop twisting reality. Msybe western Ukraine, but dont speak for the rest, The Ukraine is her own worst enemy. A divined country cant stand. The leadership is to blame too. Check history One minute you are kissing putins feet, the next you are hugging nato. And Nato whats your role here???? Sanctions lol
We can only pray for the innocent lives. War has always been heart breaking...May Allah save you All Ukrainian ❤️
Let’s get back to the real news. Boris’s Party   We have spent to long on this already.

Ukrainians and Russians it is the same people. Just Ukraine was taken by pro-NATO puppets and tried to sic Russians on Russians. I hope, Putin gave the chance to shit in trousers to the Ukrainian Nazis, will know next time how to force their own citizens to live under gun-fire. In following time will know how to show off in front of the Russian-speaking population, which a cut above them in all aspects, beginning from observance of etiquette, finishing intelligence. The West was disappointed in them and gave them back to Putin, in Europe nobody can stand them with dirty asses.
In saying that... Afghanistan will be spewing if geriatric Joe steps in 🤦😂
I think it's time time to PUT IN all the force against PUTIN. SADDAM (Killed)= GADDAFI (Killed)= PUTIN (Still ALIVE)
Pray for Ukraine 🇺🇦 🙏 😢
Russia is surrounded by countries which are members of NATO, and NATO includes countries which are en*mies of Russia. Ukraine was a very important part of Russia, and now it was going to join NATO, if Ukraine also joins NATO, it will create problems for Russia and it's safety. And no one wants to be surrounded by their enemies.rAmerica simply wanted to create conflict between Ukraine and Russia. rUkraine is just suffering between these powerful countries. rAnd if any country interferes in this matter, no one can stop Ww3 from happening and no country will stay unaffected from that, I just want humanity to be safe.
F*ck Putin. Slava Ukraini🇭🇷🇺🇦
Go Russia
Putin won the country before the battle started and everyone just watched.
When the rich rage war, it's the poor who die
Humanity doesn't deserve to stay on the earth, nor asteroid nor alien nor global warming nor artificial intelligence will wipe humanity. It will be human who will destroy themselves.
This is human intelligence for making a better world.
Ooooo ya cover russia ukraine shit hot but ya dont cover the convoy of trucks all over the world
Looks like the Invasion of Poland all over again.
Russia is not the aggressor.  Only sheep believe the western media.  It's so obvious how the west has pushed Russia into a corner for years . Breaking every promise they made to Russia . Wake up sheep . US an it's allies are the real aggressor's
in so called modern world,technologically advance,human beings find new  evil things  to keep them busy.war is just another toy  of evil.what advancemnt is this killing fellow humans,small babies.

I'm glad both my parents are no longer around to witness the potential start of a 3rd world war they did their bit getting rid of Adolf. Now it looks like the world has a Stalin/Adolf clone dragging the world  and the Russian people back into yet another horror show
Pussitin: I'm only doing this for self defense...While invading another country and killing off innocent people with military force and threatening the entire world.OK pussintin, whatever you say.
Did the queen croke
Putin has lost the plot!
The people of Russia do not want war.  We are all horrified by what happened today.  We were promised to the last that there would be no war.  We all have relatives and friends in Ukraine.  I cry all day from impotence, from shame ... now nothing will be the same as before.  People who today take to the streets with anti-war rallies are being detained.  What to do now... Please forgive us, we are not bad, we do not want to fight.  Our president has gone mad.  Sorry.
Let's pray for peace.....all this war should be stop
This is not okay. This is Europe! It is not a playground for oligarchs to play their war games - be it the Russians or the Ukrainians
Fucks rusia
We have a worthless government. The stopping of oil and gas production is the biggest problem for our economy and the American people. This is a purposely planned destruction of Middle class American people. Just like the Carter administration, we now are in a position of buying things from our enemies. In the mean time Chinese are buying and hoarding our food. If you keep knocking on the devils 😈 door, he will eventually open it.
Albert Einstein said 
This is so horrible
Well done Russia - get rid of the US Nazi imposed rattle snakes
This war is what will so reduce the relevance of putin. In 2008 he invaded Georgia,2014 he forcefully annex crimea now he has engaged in full scale invasion of a sovereign state.the spirit of Joseph Stalin is operating through him.but his confidence will be brought very low.those his nuclear weapons he plans using will surely go against him

Bullshit. Russia is aggressively expanding it's territory by illegally invading. People have already died because of the turd dictator Putin. He speaks of a Nazi state and genocide in Ukraine. These are all fake ploys to give him an excuse to attack. The irony is, is that the leader of Ukraine is Jewish, a real Nazi. Putin is a megalomaniac who has turned himself into an ugly pariah and Hitler mark2.

Vladimir is coming for Volodymyr!
Are they bombing Russia also and if not why.
I would 100% fight for Russia !!!You have my blessing well done Russia 👍👍👍
This is not just a military conflict, it is also a cultural conflict! This war, in my personal view, can be explained within four main factors: strategic, military, economic and cultural. Understanding these 4 (four) factors, we can better understand Putin's interest in the region. • 1) Within the strategic realm, for example, Ukraine is central to Putin's geopolitical vision. Ukraine is simply a vital territory for Russian survival. But how exactly? Simple! An eventual presence of NATO troops in Ukraine and/or an eventual accession of Ukraine to NATO would, in fact, deprive the Russian access to the Black Sea; which is one of the most crucial territories in the world within a geographical and strategic context. With the exception of Vladivostok, in the Pacific, the Black Sea is one of the only places that could provide warm waters ports for the Russians. Remember guys, the rest of the Russian coast is completely frozen, especially the Arctic region. • 2) From a military perspective, the presence of NATO troops in Ukraine could be a serious threat to the Russian territory itself. In Putin's view, Ukraine could be used as a military base by Nato, which, of course, could threaten the integrity of his territory. A possible western presence in Ukraine, in Putin's view, would facilitate an eventual western invasion of Russia itself. • 3) From an economic perspective, Ukraine is crucial for Putin. Since Soviet times, Ukraine was considered the 
I think this is unavoidable. Ukraine is a strategic military position for the US/NATO and also for Russia. Russia does not want US to have Ukraine as a puppet and gain military advantage. If Ukraine does not want war, the President should at least just maintain neutral. Instead Ukraine are being played by the US for their own agenda. The President is so stupid IMO. Similarly US does not want other countries like China to expand their military or even catch up on mobile device competition by banning Huawei and so on. This war has nothing to do with Ukraine. It is between US and Russia. Too bad Ukraine is in the middle of it and does not know how to play its card well.
Russia will just demolish Ukraine and no country will do anything about it, why doesn't Ukraine just give Putin what he wants?
Cold blooded murder
The good citizens of Russia will overthrow the Cremlin and Rasputin the dictator and his cronies shall burn in hell .

stay save, my heart goes out to everyone in ukraine or the people that have family and friends there♥️
😥😥😥😥😥😢😓😓
When NATO bombed the peaceful cities of Yugoslavia in 1999, you did not condole and worry about it as much as you do now.
Instead of praying for peace, Ukrainians should had been prepared to fight for their land.
I CANT BELIEVE THE BBC IS GOING TO HAVE EVERYONE BELIVE RUSSIA IS IN THE WRONG AND PEOPLE ARE GOING TO THINK IM CRAXY IM AN IDIOT IM SICK OF THE MORONS IN THIS WORLD
Hey BBC you supposed to show not tell. I seen the translation on putin speech and its different in other news station also the Ukraine president different translation. The vocal tone that you use also different. Don't try to create public opinion.
Stay strong uk. God bless uk.
People crying about UkraineWhat about Palestinian people????
why they didnt traanslate what Putin said seconds before translate? he basically said they are going to do it because people of DNR and LNR were murdered and bombed for 8 years, 8 YEARS!
It was a big mistake to not give putin the guarantee of security because Russia had a terrible experience in the past, that wasn't cost Nato and USA anything just to give them guarantee
All Russia munitions surgicallytargeting military installations exclusively.
AND JESUS ALSO SAID;NKJV, MATTHEW 24:6AND YOU WILL HEAR OF WARS AND RUMOURS OF WARS. SEE THAT YOU ARE NOT TROUBLED; FOR ALL THESE THINGS MUST COME TO PASS, BUT THE END IS NOT YET.
my heart goes out to the brave Russian soldiers ❤❤
If this was some Middle East country invading some country along its borders all of west would have pulled their underwear up and been there with their guns and bombs. Now since it is Russia, their big DADDY, all of west has got their tails between their legs, balls hanging low, and barking useless sanction. Isn’t that tragically funny?
I WOULDNT BE SURPRISED if this was fired by the UN
The Ivan shows his true face again.
I really worry for the Ukrainian people, but I don't think the West will risk WW3 to defend Ukraine.
Putin is a dictator and has already committed several war crimes. This person will probably become this centuries Hitler.
I don’t think anyone can fuck with the Russians
This is heartbreaking. I pray for the innocent people caught in this madness.
Screw them. They are invading another country.

 @Thalassaer What a stupid comment. Don't be a dick.
Zelenski, Ukrainian pfesident dosen't afraid of his job. He is afraid for his cou try and people.
Honestly why the hell would you expect NATO to help you? It's not the 1960's.How many conflicts have been fought already without them doing anything, since they didn't have any strategic interests in doing so, for you to learn that they will just turn a blind eye?Don't try warm yourself to someone when there is a giant unpredictable f*ck next to you strongly opposing it and the guys you're trying to befriend of course wouldn't do anything since you're not important for them.
same vision when we the rest of the world saw in Iraq,Libya Syria...

Да ; Если у меня и были какие-то мудрые слова для украинцев в армии, то это вот это.  Не позволяйте себе становиться марионетками и марионетками и влюбляться в парней на Западе; в частности, незаконно избранный клоун, сидящий на корточках в Белом доме.  Они используют вас в качестве пешек в порочной шахматной игре, как хорошо знает Путин. Они хотят, чтобы их ядерное оружие было на вашей земле.   Откажитесь забирать их грязное оружие и оружие, которое коррумпированный режим Байдена как слякоть финансировал ваш путь. Покажите коррумпированному в Белом доме крайнее презрение, сложите оружие и приветствуйте г-на Путина. Не прислушивайтесь к призывам и подстрекательствам Запада, предлагающим свою бесполезную поддержку; ибо ты УМРЕШЬ.  И ; ядерная война на картах.  Не позволяйте себе стать соучастником разрушения мира.
Reply to me on who you support in this crisis
Ukraine president should surrender to protect its people. Any president or head of country that is being invaded should surrender to protect the lives of people, that’s what Afghanistan leaders did and they saved the lives of so many. It’s sad that so many has to die because leaders love themselves more than the people of their country. To taken into captivity is better than death.
Of course Putin lies about just supporting the separates. Calling Ukrainians Nazis is propaganda.
Bye bye 🤣 I🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The West complains too much. You want war, you ask for it....Russia is giving you one...deal with it.
Not a good look at this time
My brain doesn't understand how we still have war in 2022 .. its so primitive and unnecessary
Where captain price
This is where you tell if the men are men and not boys and this maybe boys who want be men I'm afraid want be the men they wished to be
Shes on kids 🙏😈🙌
This is history repeating itself. Ukraine is being invaded and it's people being slaughtered. The world just watches and offers prayers. It looks like NATO countries are cowards. May your fear be replaced with action. Hitler's Nazis started with one attack as well.
Let us pray for peace! 🙏
We really witnessing a whole possible world war 💀

War of natural gas  between US and Russia.
Blamed NATO
I am not a politician, but it was very clear to me that Vladimir Putin was lying.  He is an evil man. If only Ukraine had been allowed to joined  NATO,  But all the Western leaders believed  this madman, and were afraid to confront the true reality.
Vladimir Putin is a war criminal.
This is a real heart breaker. Look at the old people that will have to finish out their lives in misery. Look at the young people and babies with no place to go but down in a subway tunnel. I'm finding it very hard to think of Putin as anything else but a monster.
YOU ARE NOT A MEMBER OF NATO!
Doesn't see U.S, British or Australia come to help Ukraine ? Suffering by its own now ..... Sad.
Question. When someone starts a war what do they aim at first? Civilians? Or army bases? I mean, when the country isn’t doing anything how do they choose what to aim at? Do they want to kill civilians? I don’t understand.
Call of Duty is actually happening
NATO, E.U is just in paper the West has lost all its credibility.
God be with you all.. Amen
Nice propaganda piece. Get your reporters out of Kiev.

One man’s values (Putin) towards Ukraine will likely change the lives of thousands, if not millions and potentially change the world. All starting today.
i live in another country but i'm scared even here, i can't even think about the people there , God help us 😔😔😔
One demand. Ukraine not joining NATO. And even that they wouldnt give to Russia.
Sadly the west going to the far right has created this.
There was little hope that Ukraine would win a frontal War but there is a silver lining. To win Russia is going to have to hold Ukraine and eliminate all resistance. The US can attest to how difficult and costly that task is, after all they failed countless times. On the other hand for Ukraine to win they just have to not lose. The resistance must survive, drain Russia's money and morale. That is 'less hard' than the former.I hope both the US and EU will provide as much help as can be given.
come on Europe go fight Russia lol
The boss
Lol... The media 🤦30 year old treason of a community that is only representative to the west.Pull back. Look at the whole history and representation of this land.Not just the left side to the story.

when you are as huge and power as putin and you lie about not attacking, what a p$ssy
Its all a planned show to entertain and put fear in the world . Sheeple will lay down in fear

Sameeeee😭😭😭😭

普京是不是疯了，还是得了老年痴呆症？？作孽啊！
If it's true that 50% of russians approve war against Ukraine, I wonder how would they feel if Moscow was bombed and their homes were destroyed. Putin is a murderer and a terrorist and should be eliminated like one.
PUTIN cant get it thru his THICK Skull that the people of Ukraine DO NOT want to be a part of Russia

At this stage NATO should send all resources possible to defend Ukraine, Russia is truly angry...
Heartbreaking
For the greed of powerWe will lost everything
How were those civilian block of flats 'nazifying' anyone??! If anyone believes anything that comes out of Putin's mouth, they are a hopeless fool! Those tanks came through Belarus- his buddy over there surely helped him out.
To all the people who are against Putin, are you suggesting he put future of Russia in danger by allowing NATO to control Russia by threatening ?? To sacrifice his own country to save NATO interests ??

Praying from my heart ❤️ for people in Ukraine
Congratulations Russia Soviet is back
Here we go.. lies that made the invasion of Iraq possible is repeating here.. poking and proding each other. Im going to live with the animals in the jungle so when i get eaten i knew they just wanted food....humanity is full of shit 😒

That Is Only In Words & In Lectures.  Shame On Our Super Power Countries  Leadership . . The World Is Really Going Crazy & We Are Living Dangerously .
50% of us jump to conclusions with what the so call social media shows us or want us to see. Have you guys seat yourself down to understand what really start this war ? No!! You didn't, you all should pray for forgiven and pray for yourself. Media will only allow you to see and know what they want you to understand always do your own reach 💯
4:35 I can't help but say that the man looks like Gru from Despicable me.
I'll bet America with it's impeccable credentials, and never having invaded any country will take Russia to task for this.
Feeling sad to see the fear among the Ukrainians and destruction of their country. Ukraine should had never trusted America- the War monster and NATO Forces who lost to Taliban who didn't even had battle tanks or air force.
Usa has somethint to do with this
So Russia don’t want Ukrainian to become part of nato but it’s okay for them to kill innocent people, blow up airports, army base’s etc… I think European countries and Americans should show Russia what it’s like to be bullied.
wars are full of surprises...the enemy dont usually make a fkn point of what they are goin to do...wtfu...
This is the end for Russia
Glory to Russia
War is the politicians excuse to transfer wealth from tax payers to the elite of the world,  this was easily avoidable but they pushed for war instead, just say no to war and these war monger leaders, if they want to fight let them do their own fighting not with other people's lives!
Poor Ukraine, they're frogged at this point. Everyone in Europe has the same philosophy, anyone but us. Sad.
😂😂😂
Bro why always y'all tryna drag usa into this
Let the problem be solved by uno
Good point, it’s not a war the russian public want at all
It doesn't matter what the Russian people think it matters what there soldiers are doing and that's killing innocent human beings
The president for Russia on a power trip if he wants war the us will for sure give it to him he keeps it up
Putin is seriously deranged. There's no other way to put it. He's hitting dementia or something.
Russia attacks Ukraineeveryone disliked that
Pray for ukraine 😢
BBC lmfao
Where are the American, NATO troops? What Ukraine needs is not light shows, it needs real support, not money for officials to carry away, it needs troops.
Dear Mr. Prime Minister B. Johnson. One thing we ask is to disconnect Russia from the SWIFT system. Oil and gas from Russia brings only death!!! God bless you!
Will the human race EVER be civil?!  FOOLS! Putin has the biggest country in the world. Yet he wants just a little bitty more! So people have to lose their country, lives, homes, businesses, and their well being.
Putin bro
More propaganda stfu
Where is NATO
This is Madness the so called dinazified meaning for Putin Only a Douchebag would come with such Idea.
It's all about manipulation and decit all to create reliable story and destabilise whole region USA need that war as war machine is hungry.

Where's the NATO air power? Smh
If there ever was any doubt in any ones mind that Putin is a deranged, cold blooded, full blown psychopath, then those doubts ought to have been erased by now.
There goes the Woke movement.
sending love to ukraine, they are so strong despite these horrific attacks
British people, sit back and watch. Any intervention, which you already have done via NLAW, will result in consequences you have not faced in history. I'm watching you.
The hypocrisy of Western powers and their main stream media is unparalleled and unprecedented, they propped up Ukraine to face Russia even if it meant war with a promise of a United help and by doing so they instigated this war to happen and now all they are doing is commentary about it yet they share equal responsibility as Russia for starting a war that was avoidable.
World is watching Putin is playing the game
Horrid sight
The war must not be caught only on Ukrainian soil. It must be taken to Russian so their civilians know how it feels to be unsafe
The whole world is with Ukraine except that selfish Petersburg guy
Far from a religious person but times like this I hope God is real so these truly evil people will get what they deserve.
All blames to American government,   their telling Ukraine that they will support them but where's it is Ukraine who will loose everything while American is benefiting
Yes, and Great Britain participated in a similar illegal war in 2003 against Iraq, about it's reasons they lied about.
I hope u could send this love to Mexico when Usa was eating it in past but unfortunately youtube was not there.
 @Yash Verma  😂😂
Send more so they can win the war
 @Yash Verma  Then Indians should be first to let the Mexicans, whom you love so much to take over your  immigration quota. Back off and let them in
 @Marjorie Dunlea  not so much. Russia is clearly the aggressor for no reason. There was nothing for them to 
Go russia
Putin will have a special place in hell,
Putin you will pay that blood
Tanto in Italia non aspettano altro per alzare i prezzi

The people of Ukraine take notes from the taliban that's how you survive and defend your country be ready for 20yrs of hell and never surrender. The rest of the world will supply your IEDs.
Praying for peace for Ukraine. This is devastating
Almost the whole Russian public is against this. Russian people, let your displeasure to this be known to your government and people.
Now whole world start to feel what happened to Palestine every single day
War is horrible. Putin is a beast.  He make all the western power beg for mercy.

What about Palestine and yemen
And sad thing is that people are siding with the west without knowing the truth
Your prayers don't stop bullets and missiles. They never have.
 @NarrowFocus  ok
 @NarrowFocus  Of course not, stopping bullets and missiles would be crazy. It can deflect them though.
I'm crying for Ukraine may God be with you Ukraine
i allwes new that BBC is a war mangar and lier, now im 100 % sure, ur all shamefull liers
RUSSIA IS TAKING UKRAIN AND THE COWARD WORLD JUAT WATCHES !
Yes ; if I had some wise words for Ukrainians in the military it's this.  Don't allow yourselves to become puppets and stooges and fall guys for the west ; particularly the illegally elected clown squatting in the White House.  They are using you as pawns in a vicious chess game as Mr Putin knows well. They want their nukes on your land.  Refuse to pick up their dirty arms and weapons that the corrupt Biden regime as slush funded your way. Show the corrupt one in the White House the  ultimate contempt and lay down your arms and welcome Mr Putin. Don't listen to the West's urging and goadings offering their useless support ; for you WILL die.  And ; nuclear war is on the cards.  Don't let yourselves become complicit with world destruction.
Biden and the demonRATs are to blame for this.

I don’t know why USA don’t mind they business and let Russia keep Ukraine. None of our business. Ukraine should of shut up instead of saying USA going to save they ass. They better give USA all they taxes for 100 years and become property of  🇺🇸
Putin is the new Hitler!
unjustified Russian invasion. shame on Russia.
War Is Not Solution 😭 Please Stop
New cod looks decent this time around
Well I back Russia 🇷🇺 and not the Ukrainian George Soros government!!!

So Putin lied to the world and invaded Ukraine?
Humans. Earth needs to purge.
Hey, BBC don't try to show Russia to be guilty!!! You are just like a tiny window through which the whole world can not be seen!!!The everything has consequences and all these happening are the consequences of USA bullshit!!!Now the world beleives a lot more on Mr. President Vladimir Putin than USA and its Allies!!!All the best Russia and God bless you President Vladimir Putin!!!
Afghanistan,Iraq,Syria, Lebanon, Vietnam, Native American genocide. US Democracy is on its way may God protect Ukraine now.
War is not good for poor human... All people are suffering with some pain.. Plz stop it, be alive & to make alive other people..
The only thing needed for evil to succeed is for good men to stand by.......and do nothing
It’s avoidable but the west choose not to, politics 101.
Can't anything go without violence.. we live only once and in this... Please make all join together to make peace......🙏
Ми, ЛАНКЦІ, завжди засуджуємо жорстоке і абсолютно нелюдське вторгнення тупих жадібних росіян в Україну, і ми завжди демонструємо свою солідарність з українським народом.
Good News...Russian army captured whole Azov Neonazi bataglion !!!
Remember how much racism black footballers got when they played for England in the Euros in Ukraine.....from ukrainian people and now a black reporter feels safe enough to broadcast and move around freely in ukraine shows what type of people ukrainian people its like GOD is humbling them!
The time of ruin has begun….https://youtu.be/rwCJvSKzQkc
The Biden administration manufactured this situation, they knew by sending artillery and everything else they was sending to Ukraine and all the stories they kept feeding to the news about false flags from Russ blah blah blah that Putin would have no choice but to act. Putin felt threatened and he’s not a weak leader and refuses to look weak so he acted. What would the Biden administration or any administration do if Russia was sending Mexico military equipment and was putting propaganda about the U.S invading Mexico and sending Russian troops to Mexico we would do the same exact thing. If Trump wouldn’t have won in 2016 this would have happened them because Hillary Clinton wanted war with Russia so this has been the dems agenda for a long time and this helps with their build back better agenda the great reset this will lead to hyperinflation they want to crash the U.S dollar and introduce a digital dollar so they have full control over us. Everyone needs to wake up before it’s too late!
Let Ukraine test invasion
Honestly who cares if they are not in NATO. We can’t let this happen. They should be given shared military support.
May Allah destroy devil Putin!My heart and soul is in Ukraine though I am physically far off.
Russia is afraid everyone will advance forward with technology while russia will stay in stone age so they are trying to get everyone back to stone age
Prayers for Ukrainian and Russian people …please let down your arms this will help avoid senseless bloodshed. Don’t shoot at Russians
if the west is not going to do anything , it will soon come to you doorstep
Loser bbc do you realize the majority of neighbouring countries are with Russia?
Stop 😭
Keep USA out of this!!! Defend yourself or ask your Europe’s neighbors
Puttin deserves the worse if the sanctions that no one can possible imagine. He is the true evil
The father beating is 6 year child.
This is not Iraq of Afghanistan hey West, be prepared what you did for the world!!!
I've seen kids die and civilians we need people to step in and protect them
He only swap the world Isreal with Russia,Russia have the right to defend itself, u swap Syria with Ukraine.Nothing change except a point of view.
Where are the world leaders, how is this self-defense…
That is when evil prevails; when good men decide to do nothing.
World war 3 has started remember this day !
Putin has disgraced his country.
Poor people... I wish the civilians in the Ukraine all the best🙏🏻
Cod war zone is now real!!
Fight hard and strong Ukraine and fellow allies we're here to help with anything there ruining the airports so planes can't keep coming and going this was planned now it'll be harder to make evacuation by plane due to that may the people that have passed rest in peace also may the 100,000 homeless teens living underground in Ukraine may you be safe and fellow citizens of Russia I'm sorry this is happening many prayers go out to the innocent people that don't have a choice to be drafted or stuck in this situation may luck be with us all and for God sake no nukes
Putin should be suffered in the same horrible way for all the crimes he did and is doing. He backs all the psychopaths dictators across the world while himself being a big warp psychopath. He backs the infamous genocide military junta, Min Aung Hlaing, from Myanmar since 2021 coup.
This is very heart breaking Sending prayers to the Ukrainians
Wtf
Fuck Russia and China
greedy dictator putin stop the war. Y did you capture Karamiya
Kharkov has been liberated. Next. Mariupol
Well done Russia.
Will all these economiats and European leaders STOP TALKING AND START ACTING.. NOW!!!!! Sanctions like never seen in history need to be applied right now. Not in a few days, not in a week NOW! These people need to get a grip and act
the comdian sucses  make Ukraine country  like this,,,, you elect comedian you deserved get bloody comedy,,,, everything have consequenses !!!!
We need captain America
The US needs to stop causing problems to other countries. Fuck the US, fuck Biden
No one wants to fight but a few people in charge do smh..
I am sorry for the pain and suffering those people must feel ❤️❤️.
Why so much hatred ??
#nomorewars#bringpeace 🙏🏼
Hopefully all the nazis are cleared out, and ordinary Ukrainians can live on
How fake, and bad edited fake shit.. Lol. Underground on the metro and there ia noone., also one soldier with  no gun. It is hilarious, not a single missile attack on civilian targets,. Lol. You are clowns
You shouldn’t show what Putin says. No one gives a shit why this bully just started a war. It doesn’t matter. He is the aggressor and he is crazy. It’s not like there is two sides to this story.
That's funny, Vlad calling the Ukrainians Nazis! Isn't that calling the kettle black!! Russia will not develop under Putin. He will pay for this.  Just roll in some stealth bombers and carpet bomb his palatial homes!
This is so tremendous to see leader who's educated doing this. I hope he'll be ended up as Hitler
😞shameful-Inhuman act by Russia .😣l🇮🇳💙🇺🇦🙏
Propaganda
This is not good at all!!! 😞
#putinishero❤
All this becouse of mad Baiden like to protect his son and his company interest .This look to simple but is unfortunatly true .For America people are just nothing this is cleat for all.
Whatever conflict they have, they should settle it as early as possible. Fighting each other in a war is not the solution. Imagine children, women and men who might lose their lives as a result of war. We ought to make a world a better place to live in, as human beings, as we are all given a chance to live on a destined time by GOD. No blood should be shed and no property should be destroyed to justify any war.
Media are twisting the story. You notice you never hear what questions are asked to the citizens before they record there opinion. Trust media are cause of this war
We need to destroy Russia once and for all.
In 1994 when Ukraine gave up nukes that time US, UK ,RUSSIA promised Ukraine to protect them Now RUSSIA attacked Ukraine what This two world powers are doing? What happened of that promises ?
WAIT! WUT! Putin lied? Impossible
The moral of the story, Don’t poke the bear!!
Where Ukraine military?
He is a sick mad man someone needs to take him out. The lies that comes out of his mouth. The money and wealth he amassed . My heartbreaks for these family a lot of them have nothing and are innocent. God bless them ❤️ xx
I hope there is a plan to put a missile up Putin's a..........
The killing of the innocent is not only barbarous and inhuman, it is also unnecessary as a factor in mordern civilization.
Here we go ladies and gentleman.. no more time for love island and Tiktok.. we are going to war.
Where you all  were when US and NATO were bombing to s…t cities of Yugoslavia , Iraq, Libya …?!

Tako ste kreirali sliku i 1999 god. Nato boombing Yugoslavishen. You write and create as you see fit.  I don't want a war, was I 17 when NATO bombed my country?  78 days.  It's a horror.  Tears came to my eyes today, when I heard what was happening in Ukraine.  Ukraine was pushed into this war by the Americans.  And he'll push you until he dies.  People wish you peace.  Drop your weapons and surrender to Russia.  America has ruined your country.
haha now The Nazi Ukraine Government are Afraid, they were tough when they calling Russia's bluff..
2 Kings 19:33The king will return to his own country by the same road on which he came. He will not enter this city, says the LORD.I will defend this city and save it, for my sake and for the sake of David my servant.’”That night the angel of the LORD went out to the Assyrian camp and killed 185,000 Assyrian soldiers. When the surviving Assyrians woke up the next morning, they found corpses everywhere.Ukraine , If you want to save your country  , get on your knees and call upon the name of the  LORD..Pray and fast and see how the LORD defends your country for your sake.... This is the greatest weapon that you have.
Peaceful anti-war protesters are being arrested in Moscow!They were saying, Putin's the new Hitler!Old Ukrainian women said, 
it is incredible, what about what the west did in irak libya syria  yougoslavia etc.... how people died? nato is the problem i think so.
Well that sucks, i though biden gave him a piece of his mind and straightened him out. Well i guess the main stream media has some explaining to do, and someone should tell senile grandpa he was talking to his potato salad again.
Wake up European union countries! Save Ukraine save democracy!
🇷🇺❤️🇺🇦
Anybody expecting US to save Ukraine your out of luck !!!!Biden only good at bullying his own people.Let this be a lesson to the world what happens with weakness abound in leaders like Biden,
Do sanctions against Belarus as well, the same ones.
You're going to fry in hell, Putin.


This is not going to end well my heart goes out to all!
Shame on Trump's mate Putin 👎

This is retaliation for the murder of General Soleimani.
This must stop
The World is against you Putin.Your people are against you.You are a tyrant and you will be defeated.
Where are France, USA, Australia, UK, India and Israel now? Why they are not attacking Russia now!? Come and save Ukraine! Ukraine will never forgive and forget this betrayal from their so called western allies and friends.
Make it from this point onwards Russia has no choice to ever rejoin the global buisness market, make them entirely reliant on China. Isolate them and cripple Russia
As humans we must stop trusting fake words as truth,  listen to your instincts and your truth.
Stopped Nato expansion as promised made to Russian in the 90s folks. And the European Union should really start growing their own spines instead relying on the Anglo-Saxon 5 eyes.
I am also against war.War is not a solution,many of innocent people are being died in this war.My appeal to Russia and Ukraine to stop war and save the human being.
So the Russian public at large don’t want it, but the soldiers are totally ok with storming in? Shame, if everyone just said “no” then the governments have no say in the matter.
God blessed  Rusian
Shame people from both sides will be killed.I will feel extremely sorry for the children whomay loos their father, parents who loss their children and of course their wives.I did experience similar.Horrible.Please both stop this madness
Stalin would be so proud of Putin...
Boom boom boys
i dont see anyone pray for iraqi or lybian when america and nato bombed them. maybe their life is not that precious. maybe because it's america, so everyone just kowtow to them
truth is that the entire west isn't willing to risk a full scale war for ukraine's freedom. And Putin knows it. He won't see any serious military reaction from the west, so he will push what he calls 'russian interests'  even further. As a european citizen, I'm really scared that Ukraine may turn out as Poland in 1939.
How is killing innocent people a self defense? How is killing children self defense?
I condemn this act of Russia hurting young children, women and men. You are destroying peace of the world
May this all get over soon 😢 😭.... prayers 🙏
Billions to rebuild

constantly threatening and escalating a conflict isn't bravery, Ukrainian politicians didn't care about their own people
РОССИЯ ВПЕРЕД!
We've got enough wars in our history books already. Can't we just move on and live in peace? Life is already hard for many, why add war to it?
Easy blockade all goods going into Russia
Only Russians can stop this now.
Russia president is killer
God be with you all my heart and prayers are with all of you may grace find you safe passage. Too the Russian president as much as I detest Trump there was a point we're I thought you were a decent person but you proved me wrong.👎👎🖕
Please listen to the full speech of Putin.
Sad another Hitler.
What exactly would cause such wickedness in the human heartThis is very bad and sad
It's funny all this support to Ukraine, they still didn't see a 1% of what A lot of countries Saw such like what Israel is still doing to Palestine.. they wash your heads , at the life after we will all meet ,. See you there :)
Ukraine should launch missiles at Russian civilian areas and will see how Russia will feel about that..
Boris Johnson - Biden etc.. they all play with fire and now they backup --- sit down and watch ! Ukraine should never trust Europe and more especially USA ---they are no fit (politically, strategically, militarily) they are playing with a strategic men who knows better than anyone what he is doing ! so .. unfortunately it's sad .. that's the price to pay when you elect an actor !
And what of the animals,  pets, wildlife, and those captive in zoos?
Stay stong Ukraine...prayers for all🙏🙏🙏
Putin can not saying this War Is in Russland Defend, Nobody hat Attack Russland
Everybody Love Everybody , how the fuck did we forget that .
WHY AREN'T OTHER COUNTRIES STANDING UP AGAINST RUSSIA?!!!!!!
The Russian Police should be held accountable too! imprisoning innocent, some leaders are corrupt.
How did Ukraine escalate the conflict?
ELE https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nXJe9i70DE
Innocent people really don’t deserve to die. Why are you hitting normal apartment buildings Russia?
We should send our armies..ukraine is our  brother, we should bring war back on russian grounds.they want war, let russia burn!many tears from the Netherlands.we need soldiers there, not financial sanctions!
BBC  propaganda against Putin and Russia.
UN and NATO needs to help Ukraine fast.
Remember the Molotov Line?
Snarling ... Wow. Its a bit harsh. But Russia is not Iraq or Lebiya. So be careful. 👍
THIS is what happens when you poke the bear. NATO scum kept pushing it and trying to surround Russia and refused to take any of their fears in to account. It's like having a convicted murderer neighbour who moved in next door against your wishes who is threatening you and telling you to keep your back and front door unlocked at all times while also demanding you do nothing about it and just take the knife he is sharpening for you. Long Live Russia!
I wonder how a response works now
to all people around the world move and do something after syria ukrania so whos next....???M pottin psycho-president please stop killing people...
Make it so every life lost in Ukraine will be matched on the Russian Homeland
Putin doesnt wanna destroy Ukraine . He wanna destroy this pro USA President of Ukraine .....
Putin  is compensating for something. Thought Ukraine would defend the Belarus border since it's the shortest route to Kiev. Horrible situation being bullied on 3 sides of country.
Lay down what weapons when Russia attacked Ukraine puttin is crazy as hitler a second hitler hidden in plain sight
Up the Russians
For those who shed the crocodile tears on Ukraine,  did you pray for Iraq people when US and NATO attacked this country upon a bottle of washing power and killed hundreds of thousands?
I think west and America is also responsible for this war because after the fall of Soviet Union what was the necessity of increasing the NATO's membership? Amirica always want to create a unipolar system which resulting this war!!
biden last week: In the name of justicebiden now: holy crap this biden dudes crazy
The US has been occupying my country for years
Where were you then when ur so called  PM Tony Blair with his Satan Sam invaded Iraq on pretext of WMD despite ur people calling not to go into warU r hypocrites only spell ur interests
They did same thing in Iraq, Afghanistan Syria.
I salute lord Putin
de-nazification, that is the proof that he is stuck in pre 90 era and delusional... sorry but.... what nazi?, Zelenski is jewish, WTF
All while Europeans cower....
My heart goes to those innocent people of Ukraine but putin should leave Ukraine alone  is it because Ukraine refused to be cowed they are just looking for excuses to act upon

Lets go russia!!!!
This is outrageous! Why kill the civilians!!!!!! 😭💔
putler xyulo🤘❤️🖤🇺🇦❤️🖤🤘
Somebody needs to take this madman out! He's psychotic! We're going to end up in world war III if he has his way...
How reporter still alive ? Putin in action now 🔥👍👍🙏🙏.  He wait for more then month but Ukraine not take serious if Ukraine guarantee about NATO not joining then it will not happen & biden bulshit he responsible for this war
Thanks America, this is all because you wouldn't stop pushing your weapon selling onto Ukraine.
While Government was pushing the Woke Agenda and attacking President Trump , Putin was planning  to start a War and make his Move into Ukraine with this weak Encomptent President!
🇷🇺 🔥
God bless Ukraine
The ones who called themselves superior & civilized beings are actually killing each other in Europe again..
نحن مع أوكرانيا ، نصلي من أجل أوكرانيا 🇺🇦 🇺🇦 🇺🇦 🇺🇦 🇺🇦
Attack Russia. The West needs to bomb Russia. We will take down Russia and remove their government like Russia is trying here.
What is happening in Russia is a travesty pushed by a mousey man with napoleon syndrome. Also why do their jets have so much smoke coming out of them. Do Russians even service their jets?
He's making alot of enemies here...
Any country? So he’s gonna fuck with the US if we step in? He’s gonna wage a war of Titans?
 @Zikliv  the American cant win a war!!! Didn't really beat Iraq because thousands of  us soldiers were killed after the invasion of Baghdad, so I wouldn't call that a victory!!!!!
 @Gus Ibrahim  but we haven't lost either. 💯🇺🇸
this is all because they stole the putin family borscht recipe... damn slavs

In the last days perilous times shall come.  Wars and rumours of wars , nation rising against nation, pestilences,inequity,lawlessness,hatred and betrayal,increase in wickedness , rampant sin and the love of many growing cold  all are  happening before our eyes... We are living  within the bible prophesies of the end times.We are not waiting for the time to come but it is already here. The signs that would happen before the end time tribulation are in place in the world right now. Believe in the Lord and be saved exhorts the bible when the grace of God is still there.The Lord is willing none to perish.Warning signs around us reveal the time to prepare for the coming of Lord Jesus ..Today is the day of salvation-2 cor 6:2.. The  judgement day is fast approaching.The second coming of Lord Jesus is very near..Lord Jesus loves you..
killing civilians 🤦‍♂️
Why don't they just tell the truth? - We are starting war because we want more money.
I never doubted Putin would attack the country of my fathers and forefathers. Mom & Dad always said that Russia 
Ukraine had almost 8 years to make peace with the people in eastern Ukraine.
:dothefive::dothefive::dothefive:Stop blah blah blah! Get up! Democratic leaders stop Putin, stop SWIFT, freeze the wealth of Putin's billionaires and their families! SANCTIONS NEED NOW, not the day after tomorrow!
That Putin is a sick man lies and more lies.You are not invading yet you couldn't even disguise the attack
This looks sad for our country tax will have to fork out once again n our own people will be left homeless n in need of help but once again a war we didn't start but all political points scoring will take over sick of it why can't the world just get on n live
Where is American and Neto
Это расплата, господа. Расплата за 8 лет убийства жителей донбасса. За сожённых в Одессе. За расстреляный 
I don't like the reality of war.  I pray a resolution will put an end to this asap.
The USA is the aggressor ,they kept expanding NATO towards and around Russia..That was open aggression by NATO and a threat it was
time to take out the bully government , and those who help them
I think EU troops should move into Ukraine and U.S. troops should drop because if you do nothing the world learned from Hitler it will just get worse
It became like Syria...if war not stop sad😥
I am  just saying they just need to take the  Dictator out.. End it before it begins...this isn't the only country the fool thinks he can just take over cause he wants to...it's 2022 why are we even talking and allowing this to get to this point.? What guess we are wanting to see another Hitler!!! Take care of it!!!
Please stop  ....

So sad
Ukraine getting clapped they should just give up tbh
In WW1 and WW2 countries helped each other because it was the right thing to do. Now no one is coming to help because they are not in NATO. Fuck Russia and fuck the rules HELP UKRAINE!
Russia needs to be hit with Nukes.
Russia lured the Ukrainian  military into the east when declaring independent states. Now attack has Ukrainian military surrounded as they have effectively pinched the country in half from the north and south. This is sad for those military personnel. I hope everyone stays safe
Ужас
If Ukrainians don’t fight they will end up with zero rights. Take up arms, don’t run, that is what Putin wants!
Prayers for Ukranians🙏🙏God Bless your country and your people🙏🙏
I would like to report the nasty things that israel do to their neighbors!!
West were correct and putins word saying we will not strike turns a lie and cowardly act
Those sirensI think my heart dropped...
Don't mess around with Russia or underestimate Putin.Its better if Ukrainian surrenders
I’m sorry for the Ukrainian people who have to go through this may god bless their soul but people need to know the whole story if they’re wanting a comment on this because this is only the tip of the iceberg this isn’t war just yet. This was just an attack. This will be a war nobody wants right now or never in a million years so people need to stop pushing this as a war but instead an invasion
Fake news
Had clever people not driven the Russians into the arms of the Chinese, things would look better.
I remember putin saying dont paint communist with the same brush...
Putin looks like hes just a normal calm man
GROW UP RUSSIA! THIS ISN’T 20TH CENTURY. THIS IS 21ST CENTURY, CENTURY OF DIALOGUE AND UNDERSTANDING!!

This is what happens when you have a weak US President like #Biden
Small hydrogen bomb
I don’t really know what the Russians will gain in this horrible art they’re displaying it’s heartbreaking 💔
european union need to start planning for medical and humanitarian aid for ukraine
Putin is now a war criminal!
This is bad. Putin actually feeling threatened by Nato. He's actually using that as an excuse for invading Ukraine. If the west refuse to do nothing, China would certainly and immediately invade Taiwan..
This is fake news by Putin. There ain't no war. It's all a bluff by russian bear.
From UK: Can't help having a sinking feeling. If US gets involved, it's curtains for us all. With a borderline senile president, God knows what could happen. Worse the Military Industrial Complex will be pushing Biden from behind. What hurts is that if he was any good he would have damped down the call to have Ukraine join NATO. Poking the bear wasn't a good idea. Ukraine was the buffer between the west and Russia
Where the hell is the Ukrainian army ?
Praying for peace, unity and safety for the people in Ukraine 🙏😢 ....
Powerful countries, including the United States, are boasting that until Russia finishes its invasion of Ukraine, there is no one man who can keep his back straight and make a decision.
Ukraine counties are coming to back you... we got you
Guerrilla Warfare is the best form of resistance, to deal with the Russian war on Ukraine
rich get richer and the poor die
''This is WorldEconomicForum war'' instead of Kremlins war. They want to make us poor. wake up people. Buy Bitcoin
Wow!!! You all have no idea of what has taken place! The third world war has started! I didn't expect this till 2023 as prophesied. I don't need news reports tell me what's next. Revelations has. It all. China then all Asian countries will join together. This is horrific, scary, revelation states Russia will start world war 3 you have to know prophecy.

Hopefully peace if the threatening NATO heeded continuous requests
Control of the Black Sea. It’s purely a military strategic move.  Ukraine is no threat to Russia even if they did join NATO.
Not Russians. Putin.
This is not an invasion, but the disarmament of the criminal, fascist army of Ukraine, the Russian military does not touch civilians! Ukrainian criminals have been killing residents of Donbass for eight years...
Russians will gain defense: their army want to destroy only military objects, that are full of NATO weapon. NATO sent dozens tons of weapon in Ukraine through last years.Very sad, that diplomacy didn't worked
 @Александр Копотилов  By bombing apartment buildings and airports?
 @Wayde Gardner  the only coastline Ukraine has is in the Black Sea.
 @captainlockes  proofs ???
 @Cineflux  my mistake. You’re correct. The Black Sea. Corrected.
 @Viktor Svetlov  That’s a bunch of bull and you know it. Stop trying to sugar coat the invasion. The people of Ukraine democratically elected their government and Putin is just mad that he couldn’t control them anymore.
 @Viktor Svetlov  that’s not what photos show. Looks as if civilians were targeted. I can’t say as I understand the entirety of the situation but bombing a city population borders on barbaric.
Why not look on the map? Its Geopolitics sir.
 @captainlockes  My uncle lives in Lugansk, stop telling me your thoughts 
 @captainlockes  my english is bad, sorry for that.Translate this in google if you interested:военная операция - это не хирургия: ракетные удары неизбежно принесут незапланированные разрушения. Однако 8 (восемь!) лет убийств жителей республик ЛНР и ДНР, которые сами хотят отделиться от Украины, должны были когда-то прекратиться.Восемь лет выстраивались дипломатические переговоры, на которых ни Россию, ни эти республики не принимали всерьез.Путин объявил операцию по уничтожению части военной инфраструктуры, которая во многом насыщена оружием НАТО. В этом есть горький смысл. Я не оправдываю военных, но понимаю их мотив: в ДНР и ЛНР украинские вояки регулярно обстреливали жилые кварталы. Очень грустно, что восемь лет дипломатии ни к чему не привели.
 @Wayde Gardner  Have you seen the destruction and casualties - in the cities ???
 @Александр Копотилов Don’t agree with what Putin is doing since I support a democratically elected government, but thanks for the info. Messy geological issue.
 @captainlockes  it's a mess, you are damn right. Peace to all people
 @Viktor Svetlov  I’ve seen the photos. I also know there are sides to the story and perspectives outside the West. While I vehemently oppose the invasion, and condemn Putin, most Westerners don’t know the complete story. I know I don’t. I wish there had been a diplomatic solution v

What bullshit, if America and Nato didn't give them weapon to kill there own people, this would have not happen, the attack on other states in Ukraine, this is what happening,now Nato and America will stand back, cause there plans have failed, playing these countries like they did with  Siria, which backed the left to over throw the country, like the did in Libya, Afghanistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Palestinian, Somalia, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Congo Nigeria Sudan, Angola , South America, Europe and America is the problem, if they don't see it there way, this is what they doing,
Qhy are we not getting in to help ukrain will fall and we will say all was done to prevent it i say NUTS get troops in let us fight
LETS GOOOOOO WAR TIME!!!!!!

Putin is putting Ukraine back into Russia.
its not the kremlins war its bidens war.the biden laptop was the evidence and you let them bury it. THIS IS THE RESULT! because the bbc didnt do its job of INDEPENDANT journalism.biden is the criminal here.
To be fair here. Putin isn't exactly wrong about what he said. All of Eastern Europe basically side with NATO through bribery calling itself Investment that doesn't mention IMF loan. NATO and America can invade Russia any time they wants with no country acting as buffer.Having military EU puppet next on your door steps is not different from the Nazi rolling into Russia while commit genocide on your people, like how Hungary, Romanian went all for that.Putin concern does went out to Russian citizens safety, concerning how easily that America roll into Moscow could happen the same way America invade Iraq and kill 2 Million of it people, with about 200,000 Identity manage to be Identify.
Russia has a right to defend itself🙏🏿
United Nations Organization died one more time !!!Nothing new NOW !!!
“The president must fear for his job” What the fuck BBC, he must fear for his life!!
LOL only being locked up for protesting? In Canada they lock you up, take your property and freeze your bank accounts...
This proves the brutality and evil of Communism and this is why we need  to fight I think that all  the nation to fight against communism.we  needs to fight now is this the kind of nation you want to roll over you we need to fight now why is the United States not interfering why are they not fighting why is NATO not doing anything is this the kind of action to put up with civilians dying baby children and men and women young to elderly dying do they want blood on their hands they need to take action now my heart goes out to the civilians and the military of Ukraine I feel bad for them all the things they work so hard for is now going to be taken away by evil disgusting nasty tentacles of communism
To bad ukrain people are gonna suffer, becouse of their political leaders  provocation on russia. Havent even got rid of covid yet and we already in ww3
Im afraid 😲 life is too short!!!! WHY???? FOR WHAT????!
Rumbling Rumbling, It's Coming...
Putin is so selfish at this time of pandemic. Russians should stop their prez
Ukraine needs to de-nazi? Thats the most stupid shit I have ever heard. Russia, if you want to de-nazi a country, go after China.
This is just stupid. Why does there have to be a War? for what Reason? dont they think about all the innocent People that live there??
There are no ‘separatist held areas’ in Ukraine - they are being held by Russian military, not pro Russian Ukrainians.
Biden keeps playing games and it hurts and kills to many ppl do we really think every time a rhino or democrat is in charge we go to war atleast trump murder one evil man to stop innocent being.harmed  not innocent bystanders and he never caused war if I recall we didn’t go to war for four years nato starts wars us leaders is the cause by playing games
Once america attack rusia from ukrine these very same people will say putin didnt do anything that's why we suffer😏outin did the right thing. Ukrine now understand nato and America were paper tigers
My prayers 🙏 to Ukraine and please Putin stop oooooooooo
Where is the Ukrainian Defense ForceWho are the Commanders of the Ukrainian Armed Forces
On this date, Vladimir Putin chose to be in the dark and disgusting side of history.
Nikita my friend in Odessa, if you see this stay safe stay strong...my prayers are with you...Hope to see you again....love from Bhutan 🇧🇹... 🥺😢😭
The West (including Russia) are the most bloodthirsty civilisation to ever exist in history. They have killed more innocent people than anyone else in history combined. Two world wars, hollocaust, slavery, apartheid, Iraq, Afghanistan and colonialism simply isn't enough for this group of people. Every few years they search for new civilians to kill on mass or governments to overthrow. When it's brown or black civilians being killed it's fine but now it's white people so it's different. Can't conveniently label white Ukraine terrorists to justify the invasion. Educated and honest Westerners know these facts about their governments. Supremacists will deny these facts and claim they are the most peace love group of people to ever exist.
At 1:05 they show a slum that 
I swear if china and other countries allie up with a murderer killing civilians

My heart goes out to the Ukrainian people 🇦🇿🇺🇦
BBC couldn't report truth if they tried.
Vladimir Putin is evil
How is Ukraine threatening russia?  This dude flat out lied to the world.
Question ⁉️ now for me is what did Ukraine do to russia❓ I have never seen a country attack another without anything. What's going on, innocents are been killed.
ww2 all over again but russia is the axis now
America and nato have to go out of this territories now.  and stop making neighbours become enemies of each other.
May Allah save the innocents
I wish Russia should Also attack on America
Bleady west u can go to war and destroy Middle East country with fake claim , if some 1 else does that to u , cry saying its wrong no wonder y no 1 is support west
Seems like it alot to ask in the world we live in 😢
Me and you need too go out for dinner and a date and discuss this
https://youtu.be/L0G9WRRWIuM
Thoughts and prayers... and other nonsense... it is unbelievable how much this exposed the west... Biden Macron, Trudeau, Boris, Ursula all just looking while putin takes everything he wants... if this is not a clear sign of how much eu and USA have failed what is ????
Unfortunately, violence is needed to maintain sovereignty and Russia will take what it wants and no one will lift a finger to stop it but they will make posts on twitter and sad tiktok clips because that is all Europe and America are right now. Its been a long time since the west fought for freedom and currently they couldn't even if they wanted to.  Next up China vs Taiwan
Your 
 @dev stuff  talk about being negative 😒
 @4dd4m4d  I think it's very reasonable of NAVO and America not to send troops to Ukraine, for that will cause WW3.
 @Mr. Bernstein  Thanks for the joyride in the ferrari dude, that new car is quick!
Governments start war, innocent people die, there is no such thing as war without government.
yeah like US attack IRAQ huraaaa

Ukrainian people should made strong relationship with Russia and not with Nato terrorists
Your 
 @Everyday Hacks  what makes you think that? And in contrast to Ukrainians those people bring a lot of it on themselves from radicalization and creating terrorist groups like Taliban and ISIS
 @Everyday Hacks  how do you know where someone else’s heart is? We can’t control our government.
 @Everyday Hacks  yes,problem?
 @niko nikovic  yeah cause Russia is clearly not terrorizing anyone 🙄
It was terrible in Odessa in 2014 for the people who were burned alive by Ukrainian neo-Nazis.

 @Everyday Hacks  Yours wasn't? I'm sure us was.
 @niko nikovic  Is Russia who is invading Ukraine you idiot. You didnt watch the news?
 @Ivan Uskok  It was terrible, this is even worse. A full blown invasion!
 @El Jona  your country's are the ones who are creating terrorist group you Piece of s**
Where is big mouth us uk and nato now not shitting themselves are they bunch of lying
 @Forastero  you Idiot Nato is in Ukraine working with soldiers and they are bringing weapons to Ukraine that's why Putin have to react, Nato broke promise and they move towards the east, everybody knows that, Nato destroyed my country Serbia with bombing everybody knows that, they made military base in Kosovo, why?? Because they want to get to Russia step by step..Romania is in Nato, Croatia, Montenegro, everybody knows that..so why you are making coalition with NATO and not with RUssia?? They are terrorists
Someone send a big juicy bomb to the kremlin
Only women are protesting.
America can deescalate the  situation by promising in writing not to invite ukrain into NATO there are already 28 nations as it is. Putin doesn't want missiles on his borders is that so much to ask for? America nearly went to nuclear war with the soviet Union over the emplacement of missiles in cuba back in 1962 .  WHY WOULD THE WORLD EXPECT PUTIN TO BE OK WITH US MISSILES IN HIS BACK YARD ????  AMERICA IS A CUNNING FOX  !!!!
Rockets from russia will burry that metro...
Донбасс и Россия вместе ❤
War is not good. Because of decision of politicians innocent people die
We should pause at this moment and remember the people of Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya and many others places across the globe who are suffering the fate as a result of American and NATO invasions of their countries. Their pain must be seen as pain too just like what the Ukrainians are feeling now. We mustn't judge others to be less human because they are not from the West.
Ukraine must surrender if they don't want violence.
Ironically War is Beautiful as it is Sad. I feel for the people of Ukraine and the pointless avoidable lost souls. It has been a while since we had a spectacular site like the invasion of Iraq You can't help but admit it is a fascinating site. Hope this will all be over soon otherwise we have to brace for a WW3.

The world would be a much better place if only the Hopi Indians of North America were the only living homosapiens on this planet and the tribal people.
Everyone woke up at 5 at 7 morning, there was loud sound and bombs sound… we don’t want it Only peaceWe scared about it Then everyone tried to get cash from banks and get food and water… I’m so sorry about it
This is horrible.... as human being of this we all need steps to stop this war...... we all being together do some strikes. and anything else but we need to stop this.... 😔😔😔😔please God help the people from both sides..... or countries
Assuming that this is a real invasion, the only proper response is a strike against Moscow itself.  Defending Ukraine is neither efficient nor tactically sound since it will cause more damage to the country without actually cutting off the source of the threat.
I'm attacking Russia because where Russia started doesn't want to be a part of Russia anymore. They can't make Putin seem like just the bad guy. Ukraine blocked a dam river as well and they are making millions of Russian ppl go with out water for months now. This is a place where Russia literally started. Putin put a shit ton of money for that Canal to be built and now they are using it against him and his ppl. Theres alot more going on then just him attacking for no reason.
Peace be still
The FACT Russia is doing this MEANS they are CONFIDENT in their WIN. Next will be China going after Taiwan.
Stop the circus 🎪!!!  Stop War!!!!  Stop playing with humanity!!!!
Just a matter of time now until China invades Taiwan as a response to this
Exactly.When Libya,Afghanistan, Syria were been hit by NATO , people from west didn't poured sympathy , but when Russia bombing Ukraine They are showing deep sympathy.When NATO bombs other country Mainstream media and west remain silent but when Russia bombs They outcry
😁 you forgot the nuclear ☢️ part!
I think this bbc is american channel🤔 America's wars on 3 countries for many years were just search operations.... Russia attack is nothing in front of that.....
Comment section: 
putin  is a mpdern day  HITLER!!!HE WILL NEVER TAKE EUROPE!!
Putin shows of his muscle
Nothing remains, Uklaine can now officially join NATO.
Vladimir will be regretting this move on war sooner than later.
Biden exposed the civilian airports of Ukraine, which most got blown up, because he caused panic and many international flights stopped.
Where was America when Israel Attack on Palestine
If USA & RUSSIA didn't exist..then world would be a better and safe place.
Everyone says his heart goes out to Ukrainians. But both Russians and Ukrainian are victims. Who has thought of the mystery that Russians bear? Who has thought of the real trigger of today’s chaos in Ukraine?
They should fight back. Its not their country
Where is the Ukrainian Air Force to repulse Russian air atrack
London will be next Puttin wants  Queen alive 🇷🇺👍
Why is there civilians who have no guilt in war?😰😭
War doesn't determine who is right...killing people who are not politicians isent an act of strength, killing is murder whether it is done by one or many, to order an army of soldiers of men trained for combat to murder innocent civilians is sick, all of this is wrong  how does a man sleep after knowing that he has caused children to be terrified to hear those sirens and bombs...innocent children, what type of human can do this without feeling guilty is a psycopath.  Way back in history in times of vikings people were not  fighting within environments of these modern times they had possibly more reason to have to sometimes but not now. This is unforgivable  regardless of religious belief it is  evil.
How is no one absolutely terrified by the reality that the greatest nuclear arsenal on planet Earth is in the hands of a power hungry man who is sounding more delusional by the minute? Putin will get what he wants. He's going to leverage the world with either the threat or act of nuclear war.
The amount of people that thought this was all a haux…now you see just how much you know
BIG RUSSIA.USA AND OTAN NAZISTAS.
Ball is in Ukraine court.. drop your arms and save your civilians..
please send assistance to Ukraine - humanitarian aid as well as military aid. In this time and age, why this has to happen? many innocent civilians will be affected. Stop Russia please!
Ridiculous!! My prayers for the civilians 🤲🏻🤲🏻
Сплошное вранье. Но запад съезд это дерьмо. Путин сделал все правильно!
Russia must stop inhibiting the world peace immediately, or else we are all going to fall victim in this and Russia is not an exception.My heart goes out to the civilians.Pray for Ukraine.From. South Korea
Putin=Hitler
Do russian citizens want the war and blood on Ukrainian  children?? If not then they should proteste against it , even the  Russian soldiers should simply  stop  killing  innocent  children's with their mothers and fathers
Seems like when Russia declared the break-away regions independent. NATO should have done the equally reasonable step of declaring the rest of ukrain a defacto member of NATO.  Unless Putin is looking to take on the military of every developed nation in the world; seems like that might have actually changed his calculus.
Russia is true
I'm so sad. What's the purpose...
Us empire has goneLong live president Putin 🌹🥇🏆Long live president Xi🌹🥇🏆
Putin is tapped lol
Russia is only returning the territories that were stolen from them in history 🇷🇺 💪🏽. Russian soldiers were fighting for Ukranian territories in the past!!
Badboy!🙆
цю війну недобре треба припинити
Ukraine is merely a battleground the rivalry is between Russia and America
Weakness in leadership is the reason tyrants pounce..Who's your Leader ???
We can really feel Ukraine 🇺🇦 people, as it happened to Us, Afghanistan.  Plz stop harming innocent people, kids, women...
Putin, Biden, Zelensky, Trudeau, Macron, Johnson, etc. all puppets directed by the usual suspect. So sickening
I just started crying watching this just I can’t help myself it’s so sad to see like this
Y didn't u mention kashmir Palestine Syria Iraq burma etc
Saddest thing is not only did Soviet Union attack Afghanistan But also the USA…. And most people supported the invasion of Afghanistan….
 @Борис  What are you talking about ? This has nothing todo with Russia this has todo with innocent people getting heavily injured or killed.
 @Physics Simulator Exactly !
 @Борис  You must not know your country’s history in Afghanistan.
 @Jshsvs Jejed  Yes, bc Afghanistan's Taliban was in cahoots with AL Qaeda who killed thousands of American civilians. Don't even try to compare this w the American invasion of Afghsnistan.
How has it been since you’ve left Afghanistan? I haven’t actually talked to anyone who’s been from there.
Dude the u.s and Britain f@@@@d your country worse than Russia.
 @Troy West  Oh I do know and I know that it saved you guys, when US invaded…
 @Mike MikeN  that one was on USA's doing
 @Борис  Please watch the news innocent people are dying
 @Борис  Saved whom? Im not from Afghanistan. And no…your country hasn’t saved anything.
What usa did to afghanistan and iraq is FAR worse than whatever russia is doing or will ever do to ukraine ... usa =biggest terrorist .. as an afghan i support russia over usa any day of the week , if theres a ww3 ill join their army

 @Hmm mmh  They have being dying for eight years! Did you watch those news? Did you even know Ukraine was killing its own people this entire time? Did you even hear about Donetsk and Luhansk?
Grow up
As the other person said   ...Grow Up
 @Yaboy16  You have no heart
 @Yaboy16  awhhh are you a likkle 14 year old who is too scared to show emotions and thinks not being sad or crying makes you 'cool' ? 🤦‍♂️😂😂😂 Go to bed likkle man
Crybaby 😂🖕🏾
It's sad that you fall for the United States propaganda.
What self defense is that psychopath Putin is referring to.Has Ukraine ever fired a shell to the Russian border
It’s been nice knowing you everyone
Nice ..putin...👏👏👏🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺. 🦅 Playing with 🔥.
3:35 Good news for Lana and her mum. When Russia occupy Ukraine and annex it, they can go back to their home at Crimea!
Get to the metro!
Nice nice : it was all translated from Putin's speech exept phrase 1:35 
@7:29 More power to these people 💔🇺🇦
people of ukraine are with Putin.....
War took place for non sense leader, he is in a secret safe room controlling the jungle rules, Russia should be ashamed of this, attacking a small country from every side... It shows how fearful the Russia is. It's the Ukraine who is Brave and fighting, Russia is going to suffer hahaha because Rubel is always Bellow Ukraine's currency.
terrible war  and many casualties from civilians . ukranians and russians ahould be brothers not enemys
Is Ukraine retaliating or they are acting sheep...can't wait to see my country which has taken my money to build being destroyed by someone I better fight to death
How much of it was actually caused by Joe Biden putting weapons on Russian borders? Not blaming asking a valid question with how much weaponry USA government put there. To be clear I am not in agreement for what Russia is doing just not blinded by media to actually ask questions and look at what preceeded it
Bbc never showed ordinary innocent iraqis, libyan, Syrian, afghans when Britain and US were bombarding and killing innocent people. They were numbers back then. Now bbc putting a face behind injury and harm in Ukraine because of obvious reasons. Hypocrites
very reasonable .. if Russia is free to invade ukraine ..??Who land does it belong to??Russia does want Ukraine to join NATO...!!!!#letsToWaR#
Unrestricted guerrilla warfare—take a page from Vietnams’ playbook. If the pig Putin buys it in the process, so much the better.

what can Eastern governments do except condemnation？
Thank You. We Need More Footage! More Action. We love It!! Dont Waste Time Get More Drones Cameras HD All Niec videos please. Will have alot of views. Thank u!
Seriously once again the civilians are the ones dying
They could stay in Crimea even in 2014
 @Анастасия  ofc, it's a jokeNobody forced them out
Russia's intervention in Ukraine is a product and reaction of the West's recognition of Kosovo. Now the Pandora's box is open thanks to the stupid US policy of the last 30 years.
I'M SCARED I'M SCARED I'M SCARED I'M SCARED I'M SCARED I AM SCARED I AM SCARED I AM SCARED I AM SCARED I AM SCARED I AM SCARED I AM SCARED I AM SCARED I AM SCARED I AM SCARED I AM TERRIFIED
Let's talk to our heart it's feel ok for you to see this
the fuck Ukraine gonna do with your heart dumbass?
This guy is stupid!! he is on his own and will die so? evil.
Once again young men and women of both sides have to pay the price for the desires of one man. My thoughts are with the people of Ukraine. Hoping your innocent civilians stay safe! Finland supports you in these hard times.  And what ever the outcome, I will never forget the bravery of those defending the independence of their country. Stay strong!
The whole world is already wounded due to pandemic and now the world is in the brink of WWIII.. Can we take a break and heal the world? Prayers sent to heaven for all Ukrainians..
NATO really is a toothless tiger ! I cant believe that the western world are just going to sit back and watch these poor people lose everything they have worked fought and died for. He is out of control and a madman,first Ukraine then who??? He needs to he stopped
We are Ukraine be safe and stay hopefully
Putin will take whatever he wants unless he is stopped. Sanctions are not good enough.
STAND AND FIGHT!!!  Freedom costs. Let’s not have another Afghanistan. Ukrainian people are super heroes. They will kick Putin’s butt.
There should be a 
Am with the Klitchkos
This sucks. I dont want Western Europeans to die in Ukraine, but letting Russia just have their way also is far far from ideal. The Ukraine people seem lovely and peaceful, they dont deserve this. But how much am I to sacrifice living at the other end of the continent? This sucks.
I will support Russia
Biden :so who's next ? Iran??
Love it bbc propaganda started 😂😂
Filthy, Atlanticist Canada, too, is an instigator of this war.
Crush RUSSIA, DEATH TO THE RUSSIAN WAR CRIMINALS.
You think Putin is leading his country without support? Damn, I want to think Russians are innocent like that. But in reality, both Russia and the Chinese Communist Party want a third world war, don't forget this is the best moment to China seize Taiwan and other territories.
 @Alexandre Muniz  I think Russians are also seeing what's happening in the West with the protest and social justice movement and thinking twice joining the West. There's no way Putin is just doing this without Russian support. I also don't want Russia and China to go away. As person living in developing country, i have seen what NATO can do to defendless people like us.
 @Neil Nelson  Putin thanks you for your support. I hope your check is in the mail 🤣
 @David Eagle  Boris will be proud of your sad ass for making a useless comment.
 @Neil Nelson  I think the Occident/West have had bad/weak leaders for years and years lately. I don't think Biden & cia are strong enough to launch a war against Russia.  If you want to be a leader, you need to learn how to show strength and get your hands dirty when necessary. Biden and his NATO allies are cowards, they don't know how to do that, they only talk about economic sanctions. And Putin gets away with this horrible act of war. My condolences to the Ukrainian casualties.
Only none human minds rule unfortunately
It’s the great reset… better get used to feeling scared if your going to believe the news
It’s just a war between Ukraine and Russia it’s not gonna start World War III
 @train chaser Fec  that’s exactly how the world wars started before. It started with one country invading the other and others eventually getting involved.
 @musica enel98  Yall are so Gung ho on calling anything WW3. Stfu and go back to playing fortnite.
 @Instiinct  how about you read a book and get educated. This is serious.
This is just the beginning of sorrows. It’s not going to get better. It’s not going back to normal. It’s going down. Period. The only question is how much time will have to pass before that dawns on you.
 @train chaser Fec  Well, maybe Anglo-Saxons think Ukraine is irrelevant, but someone like Poland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania or even Turkey could decide to help
Open your eyes.World War 3 has been going on for a very long time.And as long as Russia has China's support, it is untouchable.
To believe ANYTHING the Russians say is equivalent to believing ANYTHING that comes out of IRAN.  Lies,  deception and an attempt to control not only that region of the world,  but the first steps toward global domination.  The world must react decisively and not let them get the same foothold that Hitler got before being defeated.
my heart just can’t when I see those poor children suffering just because of Putin ego. Hurts
Just sad!
50000 people used to live here…now it’s a ghost town
Russia is not strong, they fear and scared. He is shameless putin. What are you going to gain from here
I think both Russia and Ukraine should negotiate and implement the Mink treaty. Peace for the people of Russia and Ukraine
Einstein once said 
It's western media hysteria guys everything is fine in Kyiv just some missiles and sirens.
Everyone’s heart goes out to them...but would do nothing more to help.cowards. This is why tyrants reign
Russian people should remove this tyrant out of office.
Russia is doing poorly economically and is not a power to start a 3rd WW other than being a nuclear power which would be suicide.  Leave it to the BBC or CNN to build this into something bigger than it is or can be.
Make no mistake, this war is likely to spill into a world war. Russia is now doing much of what Hitler did before a world war exploded. There is no longer any possibility of a diplomatic solution. I'm not sure how the western alliance can fight Putin without directly involving themselves in a catastrophic war.
Enough is enough. Sanctions are not enough.
Google AZOV Battalion Ppl!!!
Bless the Ukrainan people. My heart goes out to the civilians.
Europe, the U.S and the U.K should of stationed troops in Ukraine months ago. The world must stand up for freedom and liberty.
Come on Nato, bloody get in there and sort it out. Your just as bad as Poohtin if you sit back and watch. The whole thing is sick. I hate Poohtin and I hate our goverment and I hate Nato now. Boris says while feeling very smug with himself 
War is murder war is wrong
Russia is righteous. Russia is denazifying Ukraine (a Neo-Nazi state that has been, for the last eight years, conducting genocide in the Donbass--two independent republics populated by native people and ethnic Russians). Neo-Nazism is just like Nazism which is just like Anglo-American white supremacism; as a matter of fact, Anglo-American white supremacism is the forefather of Nazism hence of Neo-Nazism as well.rSince 2014 (during Obama-Democrat, Trump-Republican, now Biden's-Democrat-Republican administrations), Russia has been pleading with Anglo-America and its European friends to persuade Ukraine (Neo-Nazi state) to abide by the Minsk Agreement and to stop ethnic cleansing in the Donbass. Anglo-America and its European friends responded with more support for Ukraine (Neo-Nazi state) in the form of money and offensive military hardware and training. If you hold Anglo-American white supremacism, Nazism, and Neo-Nazism as righteous, then you hold Russia's denazification of Ukraine (Neo-Nazi state) in order to stop ethnic cleansing in the Donbass is unrighteous. Your position is just that simple.
https://youtu.be/L0G9WRRWIuM
US Army and US Airforce must reach Ukraine and stop Russian forces 👍
Violence doesn't solve anything only makes people agree through fearLets see how strong russia claim to be
If NATO and the United states have deployed military man power in Ukraine and not only sending weapons I believe Russia would not have had the balls to invade Ukraine.
Self defence?? Putin is a mass murderer.
When tf is the UN or NATO going to move in. Russia should be expelled from the UN.
We are living in a era where history is being writtenDifference is we expect to write it with computer or technologyBut are writing it with blood
Well they shouldn't have provoked Putin thinking that America is gonna help them lol... Now they heard Biden saying he won't send a single American there... So... They should have seen it coming which country saw prosperity by dealing with America..
That's y don't mess wid strong country 🙂
F*ck Russia
somthing fishy is happening here.i dont trust any news i wonder why???
Ironically Biden financed the Russian invasion into Ukraine. Let me explain, Due to his stupidity He destroyed US energy independence on his first day in office which caused oil shortages and the need to buy oil from Russia 🤦🏼
Putin is the reincarnation of Hitler
Very sad 🥺 my prayers with Ukrainians, Israel has tested almost all their rockets on palestine people's  shame on western media for double standard.
That's what Palestinian felt
The west will do nothing. Sanctions would rather hurt others than Russia.
I hope all of people is safe , I feel so sad for them Stay safe and strong !!!Lots of love from Taiwan x
Bully dictators will never win in the end. Just ask Hitler. The good people who stand for freedom will UNITE and concur
Y ukraine not devloped nuclear weapons and fighters plane? Ukraine government is sleeping now president zelenky relized whatis important of weapons. Ukraine have ability to develop s-400 and thousands of tanks but ukraine government is sleeping as much as they can. Ukraine government is purely donkey.
Putin's acting like lord farquad
That's what happens when you elect a clown.
I doubt that, they are incompetent and only good at showing off. It was the president, I would immediately do what you said before you can even say it.
And alot of Russians support him and dus making them all murderers too.
he doesn't feel safe killing Ukrainians?  Maybe Putin needs some of his own medicine.
My heart goes out to Hunter Biden , he ll be loosing millions ..
Every country in the world break relations with Russia!
https://youtube.com/shorts/qDExzi6lsvg?feature=share🇺🇦😢
No ti war....just peace arriund the world
God will not forgive putin for this reason of destroying Ukraine
Let's hope China doesn't take over Taiwan at this time. Although, this is the perfect time
One sided news
Russia is truly the scum of the earth
War is not the solution.
this is ww3 and putin is a lier,
What's next the War of Gog Magog.
Peace to our world
Vladimir Putin a Hitler of our era,  period.
Airport first so no one can leave anymore
Feear for his job is so malarious
My deepest sympathies. But the smart thing would do is give your country to Russia. Outman and Out gunned.
I'm shocked At How Many of You are Blaming Kremlin for the attacks,Why don't you Go against US who's solely responsible for whatever happening btn Kremlin and Ukraine
“The attack was in self defence”Self defence my ass! You drew first blood Vlad!
Yup. And I hope he does like one.
and He must also pay it with blood.
This is a reflection of the system as a whole. It doesn’t matter what the people want. The system always has its own interests at heart.
Very sad... This is so bad from Rassians
So the NATO countries are just ok with putting sanctioned, they should have said clearly that they will not support UKRAINE in case of military attack. It's actually poor Ukraine public who are suffering and are at loss.
BLM, pronouns and fat acceptance ain’t gonna get you out of this one! Maybe we can send in Emma and her two moms or the feminist movement? Or maybe even diversity coaches?
Najsejebeputin
You should try sending your pussy UK special forces so we can laugh 😂😂😂
Putin stupidity a Dinosaur 🦖 against a Lizard 🦎 shame .. it's easy to attack the weak
Its 2022 wtf is people doing starting shit
Prays for the people .This was planned be 4 it happened from world leaders they are all lying to the people . Hammer down freedom
UNCLE JOE WHERE ARE YOU NOW?
7:50 it's propaganda. even CNN made a pool where 50% russians support invasion.
This is HAPPENING BECAUSE the west media propaganda BBC and others and the RUBISH Ukraine Government .(I FEEL SORRY FOR THE NORMAL PEOPLE in UKRAINE )
Whatever sanctions the EU or UN President Putin do not care.He wants all the people of Ukraine to surrender or he will butcher them all and Ukraine into a garbage 🗑. He is shouting to the 🌍 He is now in charge. Do not make anymore bad statements coz he will makemore everything worst.🌍Just agree with what he wants so not many people will perish and die. ⚖️✍️🇺🇦✌️🤷🏻‍♂️🤔😎
Here we go again
I swear to God if nato doesn't rally a fighting response I will be calling them cowardly chickens for the rest of their existence
Wow, so no one in Europe is gonna stand up to Putin? Just left Ukraine alone. Oh, right, they cant. Or they'll be no gas for them if they meddle. Poor Ukraine. Russia holding Europe hostage. Be careful though. If Putin feels like invading your country, he will. And no one will stop him. Smh
Putin is a mad man. Hitler with a different language. The people will pay with their lives so sad
Scot here wishing all Ukrainian people a quick end to this horrible action by the gangster Putin 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿❤️
What a evil man he is. He really needs to be taken out. Poland might be next!
https://youtu.be/L0G9WRRWIuM<
Not the time for such cynical musings, that's precisely what a monster like Putin wants - Generalized blame. There is no system it's naked ambition of one man.
 @usazar  Did Putin support the coup in Ukraine?
Russia needs to isolated. But if NATO attacks Russian forces, PutinWill launch nuclear weapons.Calm leadership is needed, theGuy is a thug.
 @Martin Jenkins  isolated? They needed to be genocided. The way the Russian military are killing innocent people and the civilian Russians (especially here in comment sections) supporting them instead of being ashamed is UNFORGIVABLE.
 @Martin Jenkins  even he isn't that mad, he knows that if he launches nukes that every other nuclear western power will saturate his country with nukes.It's like pulling a gun on a group of people who also own guns, you might kill 1 or 2 of them but the rest will kill you.
European countries have had an economic response to the invasion, not military
Putin has finally gone mad. A mad dictator with nuclear weapons. God save us all!
Now you know what the fallout of media corruption leads to.  Just look at what so many many comments say about respect for Mr Putin and the disparagement for the one who is a puppet of the corrupt new world order.  The media being in collusion and a pawn in the whole affair.  The west conveniently forgets America has invaded any country that has taken its fancy and it has lost nearly every war its ever been in.  The fallout of Vietnam  is still torturing the minds of those who took part.  It's a big mistake putting Putin in a nothing to lose paradigm.  London is set to be wiped out with the press of a button.   On  Guard.
The USA creates problems than does nothing to solve them
https://youtu.be/BD50yv3krS4 nato response attack

Belgrade 1999...
Ukraine needs to surrender, their president is nuts.
Safe Ukrainien 🇺🇦  people 😭

WWIII Guys ,don't sleep anymore..prepare for dystopian lives after the war if you survives..good luck everyone!

Russia has hypersonic nuclear cruise missiles that travels at 6,849 mph A Russian ship in the North sea will be able to launch a missile and kill all the dirty criminal filth in parliament and all disgusting peds at the bbc (and all the other excrement in London) in under 30 seconds
I blame this in the president of Ukraine u have to do whatever u have to do for the people u have to learn how to negotiate properly no matter what the scenario also with the way poverty is in Russian money thrown away instead of helping the needy
Please the woke planning he will not allow to come to his country the way thy want it to.the world economic forum has a problem this man decided you guys are nuts and he will stand .
so world war 3 begins.just to show he's a man of Man now it gonna bring the world to an end.I Wish The Earth Collapse Not By War But By Nature.hope the earth go kabooom!!.so i can be the next new God,lol
Ukrainian politicians saw it coming, they were escalating things way before this, they just weren't in the spotlight
US and UE will come to fighting in Ukraine ? Will Idiot comedy can take responsibility for Ukraine?
https://youtu.be/BD50yv3krS4 nato response
Fake news
well done PUTIN ..time to put the west back in its cradle ..nobody in the west had anything to say when NATO invaded BOSNIE a feww years back .PUTIN is the only leader that looks after his own people and the little guys of nato and USA could not and cannot protect its own borders . this so called broadcasting propoganda channel sayd nothing last two weeks when russians fled from this shithole into RUSSIA .
I'm really lucky as a Ukrainian that I live in a small town thats unlikely to get bombed...Phew
Daniel 11:5-45, The first North King is German then changed to Russia/USSR, The South King Anglo-American, be prepared guys.
According to different survey at least 75% of Russian population  support this move  of Russian government.

Lord God protect the civilians, especially the children. Touch the heart of both leaders of the country for the sake of the peoples.
US farts u dont translate corect 🤮
So it begins
Bombing an airport in self defense? How does russia not feel save despite having a huge army and air force? How dirty can this excuse be?
Putin what you want to defend yourself. Putin you are bandit; world should never trust communist mouths. Putin's war; it is what Putin's want for war.
this is so disgusting. Weeks ago, they kept saying they have no intention to attack Ukraine, and now they are saying they are attacking for self defense, so they are destroying possible threats for them. This is a bullshit excuse.
My heart goes to Ukrainian people. This is such a difficult moment and situation. Stay strong, safe and hopeful!
Pray for Ukraine and Russia
You talk about how Russia treat protestors but you was completely silent on the dictator in Canada when peaceful protestors were arrested, bank accounts frozen, no bail for non violent protestors, called Nazis.
Let them live in peaceful. Get out Russia!
BBC and misinformation go as one ,the world knows your lies 🤣🤣🤣
not good work
Let Us Pray...rHeavenly Father, we ask for your protection and loving care for our brothers and sisters in Ukraine as they await the inevitable face of death and destruction upon their beautiful country.rFather most mighty,rLook deep into the heart of the belligerent Russian and lead him away from his onslaught of hate. Bring him back into the light of your love and those who stand with him in solidarity full of hostile, and ambitious intentions.rFather, let those of us who seek peace speak loudly and let our voice be heard this night of fearful peril.rIn your name we ask for peace and comfort to those who stare into the eyes of unprovoked assault.rAmen.
It's hard to believe that Trump is siding with Putin on this.
Russian allies are strong like China,North Korea,
My heart goes out to all Ukrainians, military and civilian
Do you understand what Putin said? Factors that in before copying literally every else saying the same thing.
It's the West who started this. Putin did only what he had to do. They thought he was bluffing. No not this guy. This guy doesn't bluff. Biden and Zelensky and NATO are responsible for this. They were talking tough with Putin especially Biden( that senile old moron) and he obliged them. They antagonized the Russians and thought the Russians wouldn't bite. Well they did, and now we're all gonna suffer because of it. Thank you western harlots.
Arresting protesters, 🤔sounds familiar
1:42 this is what’s wrong with the world. He sits there, clean, fresh, well dressed, behind a desk with buttons and phones to play his real life war game.
BIDEN LIED AGAIN  PUTIN  doesn't respect  JOE OR AMERICA. fORGIVE ME LORD but THAT SUCKERBOY  putin (yeah small p) LOOKS LIKE A CHILD when he/she  was told NOT  to take something!  Ukraine MAYBE!  I guess his MOTHER & family is very proud of his selfish actions. GOD BLESS ALL PEOPLE CAUGHT IN WAR ZONES. Russian citizens i guess are so proud of him very curious. FIGHT THE POWER UKRAINE!!!!!
Cruel Putin
I guess this is the part where NATO just dissappears !
Why though???? Why kill people???? Why strike residential areas?????
He didn't want his people  left  country before. I bet he has plan to leave when ever he wants
America and Britain causing trouble again hopefully there no War
Ukraine doesn’t need condolence or sympathy they need weapons and our military support not well wishes !
I'm not the least bit surprised.I feel bad for the ukranian people.
How is it self-defense when Russia invades a country that gave up over 2,000 nuclear weapons for the sake of peace? Putin is a delusional derange lunatic!
Wars are far easier to start than end. And Putin just started one not just with Ukraine but most of the rest of the world. Just like Hitler did when he invaded and made war of aggression against Poland.

I want the Ukrainians to know the British are with you and i hope all of you can get through this ok cause you are strong people

Hatred does not quell hatred
Russia is contender for one of the strongest global powers. The fact that they will be financially backed by China and possibly militarily if it comes to it, I must say 
 @Skep Abbas  That's the same lunacy that Hitler and all his minions were loaded with when they started WW II.

So what's next after he takes over Ukraine I guess he's going to want to take over all of Europe next
I hate Putin so much.
Did she say a Putin- Biden war?
Thank you BBC for at least saying Russians don't want this. Nobody in the Russian public wants this. They are doing it tough enough. Every day is just snow and cold and its just nasty slippery ice.
Nazis? This guy is using the drumpf play book. Just say crazy shit and see what sticks.
Let Russia have Ukrainian it belongs to the mother land of Russia. They need to pause  Now!.AND see who quits and wants out. No 1 needs to be blown apart to smithereens. Like Russia very  powerful.
Nato only is chicken waiting for Russia puts it in the oven…
I'm against the war and nato invasion around the Russia too
How can the Russian people support the absolute madness of Putin? What an evil liar of a man.
May the Lord save the Ukrainians my heart goes out for you
5:00 hide the face of this patriotic man. Ukraine gonna be invaded by Russia. Don’t play with his life BBC!
BBC favour with usa and Britain..biased news channel.
If I were an Ukrainian, I would've lost faith in west as much as Russia. Nobody intervened they are all full of BS.
🤮😬👎 PUTIN 🤮😬👎 PUTIN 🤮😬👎
Is so sad that Russians allow Putin to continue. Why do they want to end up like old nazi Germany? Why do they want to destroy and kill?  All for the greed. Putin's words are so stupid, he called Ukraine a nazi when Ukraine has a Jewish president. Putin is just like Hitler.

So the world is just going to let this child bully everyone huh? Do you really think he's going to stop in Ukraine?
what about american attack on afghanistan 🇦🇫 killing more then 1million civilians fuckkk west people such a selfish
🙏
War is war is it not !?? Different when the US and allies are attacking Iraq and or Syria .. nobody cared .. only cheered
This happened because we as USA and NATO keep getting closer to Russia wen we promised not to do it.

2:22When the journalists need to wear these vests in a European country then you know that this is utterly serious...

God bless Ukraine and all the people, stay strong From UK
This happens when you have a fucked government unable to reform the country in any meaningful way, picking quarrels elsewhere to distract from it. US and European politics helped the situation reach this point, but there's really one man alone responsible for every single death, wounded, harmed etc. by this. Imagine all this effort being put into improving the lives of Russian and Ukrainian citizens... But someone chose otherwise.
That came from a video game to
Yours and USA politics is to blame for this.
https://youtu.be/L0G9WRRWIuM<
 @Linus Magnus  it’s not her fault tf go tell Biden that
I am pro russian. And from the UK. Down with Boris and his Zionist government. Plus I know plenty of native white  naive brits who don't realise or don't  care they being driven to genocide thanks to mass migration. All I have to say is stop denying it and wake up!!!
Russia is going to protect itself from an upcoming danger, But NATO nazis aren't happy with this. Putin is a chad.
 @Fellow Æthelweard  how the fuck can you be pro Russian in this conflict?
Bla bla bla …All you can do just feel sorry
Uk ? The one who did all the invasions in past . Right?
 @Yash Verma  Key word 
I made video about ukraine! :/
Sad God had not blessed When Usa Attacked Afghanistan , syria,
 @Linus Magnus  Nonsense. Putin is to blame for this.
 @Yash Verma  Yeah, I'm sure she was responsible for all of those invasions and played an active part in them.Some of you YouTube folk are legitimately dense.
Fuck usa and nato the real enemy hear
 @Yash Verma  yep, because the UK hundreds of years ago accurately reflects the UK today
 @Yash Verma  Lol that was a long time ago pal. The UK is a completly different country now. A country that wants peace and to help the world
NATO has no business in eastern Europe!
Imagine people from Brittish colonies must've felt the same long ago :(
 @biteycat  action done in past decide future. And all the country invaded by uk in past are still suffering.
 @The Sniper  How actually a msall country like Ukraine joining NATO a threat to Russia?? LMAO
 @Cool Dude  Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen, Falklands, Ireland...long time ago ???
 @biteycat  Putin? Imagine Russian and Chinese troops in Mexico and Canada under alliance with them - would USA tolerate that - NO.West promised Russia that NATO would never come to their borders - now it was a lie. They surrounded Russia on all sides.Besides USA, UK and France destroyed Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam, Iran...There would never be this war if USA agreed on Ukraine neutrality. UK is just USA puppet.
fascism will be destroyed in Ukraine...AZOV...Bandera....
 @biteycat  and did they pay back what they took from those people? They are still enjoying some things they stole long ago.
 @Bevsworld04  Shut up you ignoramus westerner. Do you know how many people USA and the west killed?
 @Cool Dude  The UK only just left Afghanistan after a twenty year occupation, and went along with an invasion of Iraq based on lies about weapons of mass destruction. Maybe the British public want peace, but our leaders love war just as much as the rest, I can’t imagine Boris Johnson or Reese-Mogg don’t have plenty of money invested in arms manufacturers in their stock portfolios. Our leaders are complicit in this by their endless war mongering and compulsive lies. The “do as I say and not as I do”  saying doesn’t even work on children, for good reason. Hypocrisy holds no moral value.
 @Sol Librero  Because when u are in NATO 
 @Linus Magnus  Yeah hear hear! NATO contrlolled by the ultracorropt corporate controlled US are to blame.Ukraine even asked ny country Norway for weapons;how dare they! We
 @Bevsworld04  How the fuck can you NOT?! You
Also give them back the Kohinoor that your ancestors stole from Indians loooooong time ago 😂 your queen shamelessly wears it till this day 😌
Nazi sympathizer detected!
 @Linus Magnus  yeah , even your father left for a milk is on USA right ?
Destroy the Russian economy. Putin's end is near!
 @arachnophobi4  that is BS... we all know Ukraine is not a puppet of Russia unlike the other countries at russian borders... Puttin is an insecure-control freak...
 @Yash Verma  ur right m8
 @The Sniper  kreml bot identified
 @Linus Magnus  I don't see Nato tanks or shells in Russian cities do you?? Putin is a mandman.
 @Cool Dude  a country that said kick um out and voted brexit
Ukraine should Just give up like the Afghanistan army did! Peaceful take over and no one gets hurt! Civilian are only going to die because of war madness
UK is the devil 🤘 😈 this is what UK does, Don't you think 🤔
De5b https://youtu.be/VDu3w1DqGhw
 @Bevsworld04  Zelensky is a neo-Nazi who has been committing genocide in the LPR and DPR regions of the Ukraine. Those two territories ASKED Putin to come and help them. Putin has been clear that Russia wants to resolve this and get back to the international agreements at the UN as quickly as possible.
 @Sol Librero  because it allows us to line Russia’s border with their Arsenal if they join nato but it goes deeper than just nato
 @deano dog  correct 👍 and Russia has no business in the Democratic country of Ukraine.
 @Fellow Æthelweard  well you need go move to Russia you clown
UK? 🤦‍♂️ Украинские власти сами виноваты..  они убивали мирных жителей Донбаса, они не выполняли Минские соглашения... они не слушали Путина..   и Президент Украины Зеленский недавно грозил атомным оружием!!!  Зря он так..  Путин молодец - спасает жизни, учичтожает только военные объекты☝️ Спасибо Путину - война скоро закончится 🥳🥳🥳
He ain't gone help lol
 @Linus Magnus  facts
NATO should have been disbanded in early 90-s. Actually I believed in this lie back then, living in turmoiled and humiliated Russia. Ol' Zbigniew was right.
when israel, turkey and the united states bomb the syrian army that fights against terrorists nobody said anything but now that russia bombs military bases in ukraine everyone gets angry and annoyed, damn weak brains
 @Mercury Beats  fuck off this isnt a place to advertise your shit music
 @red man  are you nad or stupid? Путин всё правильно сделал . Украина пригрозила России атомным оружием! А ещё Украина 8 лет подряд бомбила мирное русскоязычное население Донбасса,  которое попросило сейчас Россию защитить их от геноцида со стороны Украины ☝️
 @Vladimir Fasyura  Если бы Россия не творила дичь на границе, всё бы у Украины было хорошо (это не точно). У России точно было бы плохо. Вот и ответ. А Зеленский - клоун по профессии, нельзя его всерьёз воспринимать.
west ukraine has attacked east ukrainian people since the coup in 2014 (technically before that). The elected representatives in government where publicly executed by the fourth reich, they shot at civilians protesting and fire bombed police officers.A common theme the CIA have used for decades.
 @Linus Magnus  We don't want your fake bless's, go kiss Putins ass. You all love to hate the West and live in the West, leave.
 @Taktik  They can also express their deepest concern.
 @deano dog  And Russia has no business in Ukraine.
 @peachy  and Russian colonies :(
 @Ruberoid Shiferov  yeah, I'm not going to translate that.
 @Ruberoid Shiferov  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
 @red man  That was not for you, pal.
 @deano dog   Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia,  Kazakhstan, Belarus, Georgia, Ukraine, Afghanistan,  Armenia, Azerbaijan, Moldova, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan.....
 @Fellow Æthelweard  no offense kinda hypocritical
Europe, it's your turn, there is Poland, then continue to sleep
 @Vladimir Fasyura  um.. ok.
 @Ruberoid Shiferov  my bad
 @Linus Magnus  I'm guessing your Swedish? A member of NATO?
 @peachy  Bullshit, we gave the world civilisation.
 @biteycat  USA... bsdk is responsible for this .... They destroyed Vietnam some years ago ....USA is a MF country
f*** keyboard soldiers !!!
 @GunzZ Pumpkin  give it back to who mush that diamond has changed hands many times over its existence or is you're argument 
 @peachy  Hahahaha definitely These Westeners Big Time Hypocrates
 @Linus Magnus  U.K. and U.S politics are polar opposites what narrative have you been fed
@Bevsworld04  Because Putin doesn't create anti-racist laws to tyrannise his own people unlike here  inthe west  I am a nationalist for godsake! I am against idiots like you who support a government that prioritises migrant  over naive Europeans like you.Ura to the last man and leader who isn't enslaved.
 @Fellow Æthelweard  ignorant English the U.K. is not a country but a union of countries who have their own governments
 @Alan Ford  Communist race traitor detected
 @Why Bother  Say to that my face weakling who needs daddy zionist to protect fools like you.
 @Yash Verma  do You mean England don’t be ignorant to the Scottish, Welsh and Nothern Irish
 @Nehemiah Aguilar  U.K. is a union of countries so are all countries evil are the ones fighting for independence evil don’t be so ignorant of foreign countries political situations
USA government told the world they realized a 
 @zishan iqbal  Russia is now America in Vietnam
 @Why Bother  cope
@RandomMonkey  Hypocritical? Speaking as white westerner I felt less oppressed as a white man in foreign nonwhite/in my own soil and western nations.wn soil and western nations.
 @Linus Magnus  actually it’s your Eastern communist parties to blame. Don’t you dare put this on the west
@CK Move  Non whites have always fetished whites as attractive people, this goes back to 3000 bc where Babylonians and Asssyrian men and women were fascinated of northern lands of white men and women who were seen as giants to them. Harems in islamic society always had preferences for white european girls.
 @Fellow Æthelweard  an English nationalist who doesn’t recognise the Scottish nationalist government how ironic
 @Fellow Æthelweard  U.K. is not a country but a union that’s breaking apart because of English like you
 @Dr Tiger  I am not putting this on west, it is as it is. USA crossed red line, same US that would never tolerate Chinese or Russian troops on Mexican border.Btw. I am not from the 
 @Fellow Æthelweard  There are plenty who realise but wtf can they do about it?. What about Tommy Robinson?..he tried and tried but the establishment always wins man. Your comment is somewhat naive
 @Yash Verma  We all have a past

 @Yash Verma  just gna ignore you .you're clueless
 @GunzZ Pumpkin  Omg unreal you
🙏
don't send prayers send NATO army in Ukraine you western countries are the reason Ukraine is suffering first you gave them hope and now they are paying the price of taking side with West
 @Burton Rd Forever 1977  yes
 @Vladimir Fasyura  i think he's nad
 @Why Bother  SNP are communist not nationalist at all. They want mass islamic migration from Pakistan idiot.
 @rAtAtAt  He is a congrolled opposition from Zionist elites. He is not on  our side or ever one of us.
 @VRGN PANTHER  Do you think NATO will invade Russia?? LMAOyou got insecure Puttin who will kill his opposition in Russia. Fact. LMAO
 @Sol Librero  no but I don’t believe putin will sit back and let all of his opposition line up his border full of their Arsenal and then  force his hand via sanctions and regulations with the threat of violence so clearly possible on his borders. Not even bringing up a republic of his own land being propped up too lol
 @Sol Librero  I can see exactly why he is doing what he is doing. I understand. Early bird gets the worm
 @VRGN PANTHER  yeah killing inocent people gets the worm... he will rot in hell LMAO
 @Fellow Æthelweard  what does SNP stand for… Scottish Nationalist Party 😂  but apparently there not nationalist according to you 💀 think you’re confused with SCP
 @Everyday Hacks  Its because he don't exist
 @Why Bother  actions speak louder than words fool. Plus its always funny that a scottish soy drinking commie like you . Hates the english cause your a seething celt being btfoed by based Anglos and Nords  and worst tends to move like many to england for better economic opportunity. Hell I am even considering buying Scottish Highlands  someday but I know that there are more scots living in england than its the other way round. So funny the stupid communist side of your nationality is too blinded by arrogance to see that as not a weakness.Imagine I that hated the scots, which I do not cause I am half scottish myself,  wanted to own the scots by moving like many Englishman to scotland cause it had a better economy than england? I would be a fool  as an english nationalist if I did that to own the scots.
 @Fellow Æthelweard  soy drinking? This Scotland our main export is farming goods I’m English born moved to Scotland never looked back prefer the Scots to the English especially now far too many right and left wing nuts with zero common sense like yourself you’re so chaotic don’t even know if you’re left or right to be honest your both the same though, so far I know you’re anti Jewish but that’s the left and right 🤦🏽‍♀️
 @Fellow Æthelweard  by the way the English are also Celts learn your own history please
 @Fellow Æthelweard  You should be ashamed of yourself,  I don't like Boris Johnson,  but that is no reason to support Putin, he's a wicked evil man who has had plenty of Russian people killed let alone Ukrainians!
 @dbsill cockney  your point??
 @Andrew W  Boris is importing invaders unto your nation? And you prefer him to a man who wants the best gor his people?
 @Fellow Æthelweard  Putin doesn't give a shit about his own people,  he's literally stolen billions of dollars from the Russian state & ordered the deaths of hundreds of his own people!
Sharon Greasby thank you! God bless you! Putin is a murderer
 @avril delarosa  what'd Biden have to do with this? Last time I checked it was putin invading.
Does this include the ethnic russians in Donbass (Ukraine) that have been fired at for 8 years by the ukrainian army and slowly starved to death by cutting power, water, food supplies, financial services? Of course western media did not report about that, but it's the hard reality on the ground. Russia is not watching the people in the Donbass getting slaughdered.
 @Yash Verma  Survival of the fittest…. Plus we have given world the most popular language on the planet. The English language lol
 @Yash Verma  And everyone has invaded everyone England had been pillaged and raped by the Vikings and Romans for hundreds of years just saying
 @deano dog  I agree I don’t care for Ukraine stop asking for NATO and US help
 @Linus Magnus  UK most elite when it comes to special forces 💪🏽
 @Bhot  Exaclty these bozos just jealous of western life damn backward priks
all planned and china will invade Taiwan next

Suốt ngày rêu rao usa xâm lược irap syria giờ đi xâm lược ukraine đúng là bọn russia đểu cáng
One tyrant stomping on another one....looks like the Russians are just overrunning the country.... Is there any real resistance ?
If putin wants war so bad why doesn't he take a gun and fight himself, he orders innocent people to fight innocent people while he sits in his place
some call it invasion, some call it revolution.
Turns out Russia is indeed as backwards and evil as portraited in every movie.
because he following the western evils
What the hell is going on with these officials saying they were doubting an all out attack?? Everyone knows, EXPECT THE WORSE AND HOPE FOR THE BEST. Its a dumb cliche but ffs have a damn plan in place 
Putin is God!
Call it for what it is!! It’s LIES!! ALL LIES!! Putin taking over😡
в итоге из за этого Путина Русские запомнятся в истории как агрессоры ...не зря Немцов говорил что будете вспоминать Путина как Гитлера .

God bless Ukraine and Ukrainians! They are protecting their homes, they did not go somewhere. The world should block russia completely !
Of course if other countries join it will be a world War and it's effect will be devastating But just imagine the pain of Ukrainians 🥺Sorry to each and every Ukrainian 🙏
It is only a matter of time before nukes get involved.
I don't understand all of the sanctimonious BS from the Western media and bloggers.Where was the PRAYERS for Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Libya and Serbia when NATO was illegally invading ALL OF THOSE COUNTRIES?

How can we believe BBC is telling the complete truth where they lie so much
Don't understand this war. Why is Putin interested in Ukraine ? Russia is already too big, why would he want a pieace of Ukraine ?
War war and more wars
Dude says it's a threat he is the threat crazy people do not need to be in power never understood that?

America must leave Ukraine soil ..  I support PUTTIN ..  Ukraine is a disgrace to let in America in their country... that's treason... and the only punishment for that is death ... Ukraine betrayed Russia by letting in America... and kno Russia and America are allies !!!

Who is Russia to decide that Ukraine need to be demilitarized. Would Russia demilitarize to make other countries feel safe? Shameful acts by Russia
Unfortunately, Ukraine isn't part of NATO.  Hopefully many, many Russians will suffer the consequences of this action.

Ukrainian prisident has to take this responsibility sure
I request  on the  behalf  of  the  world. ..please  pray  for  people  of Ukraine 😢💔
No form a government is legit .
How it comes that Russian after going through II war start war again ...  with new Hitler - Putin.  God bless Ukraine
I hope the world will help each other destroy russia
There are two sides to every conflict. This is no exception! If you know anything about the history in this area. You should get a more balanced view of the conflict! A worrying😥😔 situation for All!
obviously, this is cruel and horrible and what not but seriously. what did you expect russia to do ? putin is not biden to be full of shit and empty words... he warned everyone on multiple occasions. so again, what did you honestly expect would happen ? just that.
Hey putin..blo me
No NATO No War, get far away from nato Ukraine
We just started another war, heh. Boris wanted to get the attention of Putin,as said in this video, well you got it https://youtu.be/zT80QZDjpZ4
Russian economy must be destroyed now
Humans are such stupid, destructive, disgusting creatures.
The sad thing is that no one is supporting anyone The same happened in Afgaan and now it’s happening in Ukraine.All top organisations UN and others are silent Watching people die I thing Thanos was right  We don’t deserve to be here ☹️
To any civilians who may see this, I'm so sorry for this stress, on top of the last two years of stress. I'm sorry that not just my country, the U.S., but every country ignored this, and allowed this to happen. I wish you best of luck in surviving this, and love out to you and your families...
Since America and the NATO always want Ukraine to join NATO, I think Putin want to make sure Ukraine is in ruins before joining NATO 😎😎😎

Speak for yourself I’m American to but I’m tired of people putting this shit on America. America is supposed to do what get into ww3 for a country that has nothing for Americans?. Would you be willing to be drafted and die in ww3 for a country that has not helped America at all? I feel for the Ukrainians but it’s not our war. America has given billions in military aid and training to the Ukrainians. People always do this America gets dragged into a war for a so called Nobel cause than it turns to a shit show. Vietnam was the same the Vietnamese government begged America for help. Korea was the same. The Middle East was the same. This conflict is between the Russians and Ukrainians not America.
 @Chuck Noris  another country no, but innocent lives yeah
Ukraine is a breakaway state. It's only a matter of time before they are returned back to their true country, Russia.
 @Chuck Noris  Honestly I agree with the u.s. not going to war, I mean you're right with Vietnam, but that's why I said all countries. Idk I just feel like more could have been done. But I'm also conflicted in that opinion for that fact that the best option for the world was probably to do nothing, if everyone joined in it would be world war III...so idk I'm just sorry for the citizens...
People they said where is America
I'am so happy rusian start the word war 3     😎😎😎

Well done BBC! By obsessively pushing your pathetic woke agendas you have weakened the West and contributed to this attack. Congrats too, when China suddenly takes a liking to Taiwan, .... which can’t be far off.
Man I think we are in middle of ww3 now
Coward NATO. Nato should go there
Sound familiar? Putin = nouveau Hitler: “Hitler had proven, by tearing up the Munich agreement and invading Czechoslovakia in March of that year, that he could not be trusted and that he had to be stopped,” Bouverie says. By falsely claiming that he only wanted to fix damage done to Germany from World War I and restore German lands to German people, Hitler had previously been able to convince his counterparts—already wary of war—to hold off. “Both of these claims are proven as lies when he invades Czechoslovakia in March 1939 and the British government realizes that he is intent upon wider European conquest—possibly domination.”
Russia lied and Biden knew it, trust Biden he actually reads the reports that trump would not read and eat.
The world shud show Russia that it shud stop being a bully
My god I feel so horrible for the Ukrainian people. They don’t deserve this, they deserve to live the way they want.
No war please...
Here come da nukes
Guys lets keep Ukraine in our prayers <3

Down with putin
Hello BBC! Why don`t you go to Russia and get public opinion about this war?
If anyone kills an innocent soul is as though he had killed all mankind and whoever saves a life is as though he had saved all mankind. Quran (5:32)
Russia is just going to walk into Ukraine destroying and killing as much as he pleases without any resistance. Russia sinks to new lows.
There's no such thing as Great Russia, Putin has too much interest in criminal activities, drugs and small children. His wife left him because he's using his ego and his people as his tiny length of his penis.
Ukraine is largely responsible for the funding of pandemics and human trafficking. Ukraine deserves to be attacked (and only the Deep State funded entities are being hit). Biden is a national security threat because of his dealings and his son’s dealings with Ukraine. Do some research on Biden and Ukraine scandals. This war is political, and the Democratic Party cannot survive without such wars.
Russia deserves to burn. Slowly and painfully
Put is evil like Hitler.
Absolutely diabolical
Western killed millions of people in iraq siriya afganistan  😡😡🤬🤬🤬 now russia showing its power Western  are helpless now
If anyone wants to understand what is really going on inside Putin's head, you have to know who Alexander Dugin is. He is the intelectual, the master behind some of Putin's politics. Read this interview from 2014: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28229785To put it simply: Dugin and Putin wants put foward the Eurasian plan and restore the old Russian Empire. Remember: Putin is not a president. He is not even a mere dictator. Putin is the new tzar.Unfortunately, the West will not save Ukraine from Putin, just like they didn't save from Stalin. Putin doesn't care about these sanctions and he has the entire KGB/FSB on his hands. Do you think Biden will rush and do something substantial to actually drive the russians out of Ukraine? He won't. He doesn't want to.Also, keep in mind that Russian and China are allies.
This is so sad!
BBC are so hypocrite, it's un believeanble. Reporter just said that Russians do not want war, it's Kremlin's war.BBC didn't say that when British people didn't want war in Iraq..
BBC fake news
Flatten Moscow , get this madman and hang him now

Lana and her mom were forced from their home in Crimea years ago. wow they must have been bad Ukrainians...
Look at this pompous fool.power hungry putin  .He will go down in history as another tyrant . Democracy will never loose
Ohhhh Shhhht!
Soviet Union is back
Blame the USA & NATO.
🇺🇦
US and NATO is all to blame here.
Patton must be rolling in his grave. He called it right during ww2
This is the real face of Putler, a pathological liar and now a ruthless murderer for his brothers ! My heart is with  Ukrainian people.
Ukrainian's getting what the wanted they wanted to join NATO and now getting what the deserve
Whatever happens no US or British citizens should be there as long as it stays contained in Ukraine. Of course give aid and relief but no lives
Ребята, мы с вами! Бог вам в помощь! Молимся за вас!!🙏🙏🙏❤️

Shame on you Mr putin!!!!!
Clearly Ukranians don't want to be part of Russia
Looks like the keystone cops driving the tanks.
these are the first video images I've seen of cruise missiles that were not made in the US
And all of this because of a MEME.

I wish BBC would report on other conflicts like this in Armenia and Nagorno Karabakh Republic Area where Azeri Turkish terrorists attack Armenian populations
All countries attack Russia now...
Such extensive coverage with destruction shown and it's not even the first few hours of this happening. Wish they'd cover this type of destruction elsewhere in the world as well. They don't because the cause of that destruction is Western powers. Not as interesting. That being said, heart goes out to people in Ukraine and anyone else that's about to be victimized by this war. No fan of Russia, but Europe and US kind of forced their hands. Would we accept Cuba going into formal alliance along Venenzuela and a few other latin american countries, inviting Russia to establish military bases a few 100 KM's off US borders? No we wouldn't. So why is NATO on Russia's doorsteps ok? Shame that this question is never asked in western journalism. Especially the mainstream. But I'm not surprised.

Last chance for Nato and USA act now to pull Putin out of the earth.......sanctions more and stronger than ever must let his people and his economy down to the ground then we will see many many his people act to the sucker ect....soon or late sucker could not hold on his chair anymore. Act stronger ok ok......maybe his last chance too!!!! Where is Biden??? Sleeping now????
9/11(13) NATO(American) destroyed all the countries ...f..u...k .....9/11👺👹😈....I stand Russia
👀 I'm gonna say it:  this probably wouldn't have happened under trump
Yes continue downing their economy until russian people rise up against him
This is a senseless war.....
Welcome to WWIII.
Having led Ukraine into war with Russia, 
I can’t believe how unprepared Ukrainian were despite the several warnings made by the us. “ the president fear for his job” you mean his life. What were they think was going to happen everybody told them there army can’t withstand a full Russian invasion and the west wouldn’t get involved. If I was the president I would just adhere to Putin demand and save Ukraine people even if It cost me my job. This here has a high potential to lead to a ww3. Even with these sanctions innocent people from both country will suffer heavily which will force Putin to escalate and blame the west. This does not look good
2:56 there's a Russian SU-354:35 then pick up arms and fight for your country and your family.
Belorussia and Lukashenko must be sanctioned equally with Putin and Russia, Lukasheko allowed Belorussia to be used as staging point for attacks. Ban/stop all computer chips and electronics exported to Russia as they use them in military vehicles.
In 2022, a pandemic that lasted 3 years and a war with casualties.  How much have we really progressed? All the latest technology yet archaic mindsets.
this is what dictators do
Where is USA now ? Why they not helping to keep peace and democracy? Where is Germany?
Missile goes very slowly like bird
These military countries are  bullies, I remember when into little Grenada and bomb the poor people even buried the leaders with their families not knowing where they were buried. Why were these people murdered by america? All because Cuba were helping them build an airport. No love here  for America.
Why can’t everyone just get along it’s awful I hope everyone is ok in the end but don’t forget good always overcomes evil
NATO is solely responsible for this war with its unjustified expansion. What were the Americans thinking? Will Putin back down at the expense of his security and the independence of his decision? It was America that ignited this dispute for biden's interests and the oligarchy that brought him to power.

Here are the liars of the Sabaks, the Russian army does not shoot at residential facilities. By the way, a NATO base under construction was destroyed in Odessa, and what, where are the

The world shouldn't support the Russians at all.
You poked the bear till you got the war you wanted. Then act suprised and abashed. British banker controled government wanted this. Now draft all the new immigrants. No whites allowed, they could be sympathizers.
democrats are IDIOCRATS AND POLITICS BIGGEST RICHEST GUNS WIN WORLD WAR YEW FUCKS!

Putin = War crimes criminal.
What a waste of everything..... SMH......😦
BBC 
Its so sad, we are one!! The human race we all are brothers & sisters, like they said this is the Kremlins war not the peoples...#nomorewar  #peacenotwar
And this, dear children, is why you should have nuclear weapons. So other countries don't get ideas about invading your country.
Russia has just started its historic isolation...We have just about defeated the invisible corona enemy and now we need to deal with yet another human catastrophe. It seems as though the humans need to take these horrific blows to learn lessons about the value of human life. Sadly, we have had so many of them and still nothing!
This attack is working out exactly the way everyone knew it would. No surprises at all. Russia warned Ukraine and the West...implement the Minsk agreement and don't allow American missiles to be positioned along Russian borders. Simple demands that everyone rejected and now the bear has finally tired of being poked.
Russian people should say no against Putin.

The kids man...
I felt so hurtful for the common people of Ukraine, I lost three closest related in few one month, due to sudden death. So I feel like, how can some Mickey mouse decided to just bombarded a country without hearing the common people voices..😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Strahlen wir um die wette mit einem Lächeln statt zu schießen vieleicht geht es ja ihnen dan besser sind doch auch nur Menschen mit Fehlern und traurigkeiten
Putin is a true Monster!!! The Hitler of the twentieth first century!!!  Hopefully this nonsensical war will end soon an the civilians will be safe!!!!
How I wish all the countries will turn against Russia 🇷🇺
NATO leaders are responsible for the suffering of the Ukrainian people. They did nothing to seriously deter Russia from invading. NATO has once again proven to be worthless.
I can’t imagine how terrifying this must be
Every country should have doom shield to be protected from missile attacks
America, Britain etc have short memories.  What about when they illegally invaded oil rich Iraq which led to the death of HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF INNOCENT PEOPLE!  And the MSM like BBC, Sky, Fox, CNN etc are every bit as guilty for perpetuating the WMD Lie.  I’m no fan of Putin or Russia but I’m sick of the hypocrisy!
https://youtube.com/shorts/qDExzi6lsvg?feature=share🇺🇦😢
Weak Biden castrated the US military. He's only good at pushing around his own citizens. Now the world knows he's irrelevant and useless
I worry about this
Regard every major trouble spot in the world and you’ll always find the US behind it. It’s been the expansionist programme of NATO that has caused this. Russia did not want this, she’s only fighting for survival and protecting her borders. If Russia had been doing to the US what the US has been doing to Russia, via NATO and NGO’s, then it would have gone ballistic long ago… (Vis-a-vis Cuban missile crisis 1962.)
America and Israel are secretly responsible for the war. They provoke small countries.
This happen when you ignore the history . Not only US have the right for a safety Zone (Kennedy / Chruschtschow) . Too much talk ia all case but to make Ukrain to a neutral Zone same Swiss ,  no word about no Idea´s .     This is the result .   My Cellar and tanks are full.   Have fun with Gas Heatings .
Long live Ukraine. Russia stop war. We indian are always with you. Totally disgusting 🇷🇺.
It seems UK and US are only interested in attacking weak and helpless Muslim states and groups but too coward to defend Ukrainians against Russia. Or maybe if Russia was a Muslim country they would have been interested.
The President of 🇺🇦 looks weak as shit.. I’d take over too if was 🇷🇺… let’s goooo 🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺 take over that shit🤝🤝
what war ? .... LOL !!!!!!!!!!!
So scary
Ukraine government is exactly like hadin afghan government was working for USA and ran away when time comes to fght?????
Fake BBC News.
this is all ego and show of empty power . nothing else. anyway, this can also be called the game of jungle. we can't call ourselves civilized. we're barbaric animals hungry for our needs
Sob stories are fine but putin and Russia need to pay and nato and the world must do it.
Protests in Russia ends the same way as in Canada and Biden’s America it seems.
Watch out Russian you will get Nuke
Now, send Biden alone to protect Ukraine with one assault rifle
nato will react after many innocent ukraine peoples died .sanction will not effect that man only action could stop this
Hitler born again to kill
Vlad and his insurgent proxies in Donbas are vile pigs. None of them were held accountable for shooting down MH17 and murdering 298 people.
Well said👏 trouble is the masses will never realise this.  They will keep believing the military industrial complex propaganda put out by the likes of BBC, Sky etc.  The same MSM that told us the WMD lie that ultimately led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people in Iraq during the ILLEGAL invasion
Come on men save the people going to die,
My heart ❤️ goes out for the people at the end of the day it’s the civilian who suffers
Putin is just mad... how could he did this thing to the people of Ukraine... how could he can sleep when he knows that he killed lot of innocent people.... My God... just help the Ukrainian people...
You know they wont stop at Ukraine right? Putin has always wanted to cement himself in history like Stalin. This is the start of WW3, if anybody reads this in the future i hope you can reply how stupid this comment was.
Europe’s fault. They just kept pushing.
😢
What a selfish president representing Russia
This is stupidity they have to wait
So UK and US. Now what? You have been promoting war against Russia. You keep providing Ukraine with weapons and send in your soldiers. Go on. Show us something that you have created. If you want to fight, so he fought!
Signs of the last days of the Bible are here and have been here for a while, but now are getting worse and worse. Jesus is coming back soon repent and give God the glory 🙏 😤 👏
Putin wouldn't push President Reagan around like he has Biden
mustang at 2:37 be lookin good tho
Putin is murdering unarmed civilians, is the world just going to watch? Or are they going to stop this KGB scum before he comes after them……. And he will!
This makes me so angry

Russia is not going to put up with NATO weapons on the Russian border in Ukraine.  What did America do when Russia put missiles in Cuba?
I support Ukraine. Down with dictator Putin.
Its an invasion!!! Russia: its just a peice keeping military operation

Disgusting.  Putin is disgusting.
Evil Deictful Putin
Communist pigs.
I feel so bad for the people of Ukraine 🇺🇦 love Ukraine from USA 🇺🇸 ❤️ 🇺🇦
The Four Horse Men! Covid was the First, Ukraine/Russia War is the second, collapse of the financial institution is the third, and the Death will be the last Horse Men. The signs are all around us.
I'm appalled and feel so hurt by what is it happening to Ukrainian. This is  the doing of The West,cuz they convinced or forced Ukraine to give away the nuclear weapons after the fall of the Soviet Union and now they can't defend the people of Ukraine.Ukraine having nuclear weapons would have been the best deterrent against any kind of aggression.
What Third World War come from who is dear to go to war with Russians over Ukraine USA couldn’t go to war with North Korean which is compared to Russian in size with Russian is nothing and doesn’t need to many military man power to invade the little country putin know what he dose just punishing f
Good sell USA! Bravo for all the arms you had sold
Ukraine civilians:nato,please help usNATO:hold my prayer 🙏
Ban Russian banks from Swift.
Thoughts and prayers go out to the people of Ukraine.
Our hearts are with the civilians ❤️ Hope everyone is safe

last 2014,Ukraine is really evil because they shot MH17 plane &no survivors.😢 ✈
You do what you need to do VLAD Only we are allowed to start a 20 year war with Afghanistan and then another bullshit war with Iraq right warmonger Joe
Nothing will happen to Putin or his nazi policies until the Russian government and its agencies turn against this monster! He has invaded Ukraine and it is time to help them defeat this disgusting megalomaniac.  Governments keep saying sanctions work, but my problem with that is it is usually only the average, ordinary citizens of a country that ars affected by shortages of food and little or no money.  Putin is a monster that needs to be stopped for the sake of everyone before that monster destroys everything on this planet we call home.
8 years the Ukrainian army have been shelling the eastern regions with more than 14,000 killer thousands of which are childern, why did you not speak up, now that the tables are turned you cry. Of course BBC only shows what aligns with their propaganda.
My prayers and heart go out to the Ukrainian people 🥺😢😥
BBC propaganda news😂😂😂 like in Syrian war. No credibility at all. These BBC and Western news always twist and broadcast their own narratives. What a bunch of liars.😂😂 Just stop it because no body believes your lies anymore.
Go ahead and bite off more than you can chew Russia we here at USA are ready with our vodka burning bombs and bear guns.
Other countries in Europe are silent.Russsia will come for them in future
You do what you need to do VLAD Only we are allowed to start a 20 year war with Afghanistan and then another bullshit war with Iraq right warmonger Joe
Russia has been assured Ukraine would be non nato since 1947 . Over and over . The west keeps putting nato countries surrounding him. The west would never allow foreign bases in Canada or Mexico , in fact they have. Law to that effect , the west is still punishing poor Cuba since the 60’s for drying to put misiles during the bay of pigs . Why didn’t the west get the hint they were  going to far when Russia attacked Georgia . In 2017 it was said Ukraine and Georgia would be joining nato , Russia obviously drew a line in the sand . The west could of stopped this by just signing that Ukraine would stay neutral . The west should be focusing their triggers towards China whom they have created into a peer opponent. This is a war of stupidity from lack of better foreign diplomacy . The west can no longer push their will around thoughtless of the consequences as in all Middle East Afganistán, Irak , Siria Libya half of South Americans. Sometimes help isn’t help is it . We need way , way better chess players.
Shame on Western Country! They should help them!
When he says self defence he is counting the citizens of the Donbass as Russian, which most of them are. He is knocking out Ukraine's communications and commahd  centres to prevent effective attacks on his troops, as is his duty. They will only occupy the Donbass with the full approval of the Donbass residents,who are tired of the desultory shelling by Kiev forces which they have endured for the past seven years. Ukraine is not a democracy. Democracies change governments by means of elections, not by violent coups. The Maidan coup is the root cause of the problem, and was carried out 3 months before an election was due. Putin's reported numbers are not ebough to occupy the whole country and will not take Kiev.
No one will save Ukraine. Thus, it is better to be surrendered by Russia very urgently before the worst destruction will come.
The BBC is not seen to be active in this way when the Palestinians are oppressed in this way.
Totally unnecessary.
Trump would have sorted this
KARMA !!
good
My heart goes out to all the innocent people being hurt in this bullshit
why the fuck do we have all this weapons and all this trained people if we can’t keep peace and kill all this mad man‘s … Why do we let every dumb mtf do this to innocent people, to our planet… why do we accept all this now …
Lanat putin lanat ul khabees
DONT JOIN NATO
i think the question we should be asking soon is how far will this go? Will Putin stop at Ukraine ?
Cry me a river Ukraine.Ukraine as a nation, has been arm to arm with the Yankees destroyed country like Iraq, Syria, Libya, Afghanistan and the even concentración camp in Ukraine.
Poutine it s Hitler.
De-Nazi Putin's head.
When you let an individual  stay in power for far too long,they tend to think they are immortal.
Well looks like a bunch of Ukrainians will be headed to America I bet
Russia has once again proven that it's a horrible and disgusting country
Fxxk You Russia.
Defend itself by invading a country, okay got it. Just like that bully in a hallway, if you try to fight back he'll start beating the shit out of you in 
Putin has a valid argument and reasons to do what he is doing, but NATO don't want to address his concerns, they just beating about the bush, trying to take Ukraine into NATO at expenses of Russian security concerns
Мазепия познает страх,боль и скорбь. 🇷ussia 💪
No To War !!!
Dear Ukrainians do not give up and make it costly for this criminal Putin. Use all means to make sure his Russians go back in body bags.
I love putin
This is devastating. Nato must act on this madness. WW3 is starting, why do we not learn from the past? 😥😥

Those men are true men the ones willing to fight impossible odds against the Russians and most certainly die are infinitely brave and very honorable men they would do anything for their country and familys everyone should do the same and eventually even the us will have to do the same
So unnecessary humans are stupid
This is absolutely heartbreaking 💔 😭😭

Take putin out and stop this for the sake of the Ukrainians and the rest of Europe
all the things that the bible said is coming to light.. judgement day is closer and closer
Putin is doing no different than the US does. So now it’s wrong? Who made America the Worlds Police?
So our destiny is in the hands of a mad man.... Stay strong.
What the hell is wrong with Putin?
Putin using the playbook of Canadian and US politics- social justice warrior it up and conquer the people to protect them against racism and bigotry.

Warcrimes go brrr
Fuck that traffic, my ass would be on a bike with my kid in my trailer on the back booking it between cars
Those in power wage the war, but it's the innocent civilians who pay the price. The world needs to take more serious action, Putin needs to be stopped.
War will end soon with few casualties for Ukraine and some land loss  , just enough for Ukraine to won't cooperate with NATO.stop calling this WW3.
Long live independent Ukraine!
His words of wisdom world war 3
Ukraine is a western military proxy
It's amazing how selfish and self centred The WEST is. It's amazing how hollow their promises were to Ukraine .Just talks and talks of sanctions that too Hollow ones so that economies of anglo saxons stay intact How foolish Ukrainian leaders were that they abandoned their nuclear programme and believed in West instead of being self sufficient
Russia playing Victim lol as if it's  self defense.
Can someone link a video of russia bombing the western cities or kyiv? I can only find videos of attacks in areas nearer to the donetsk and luhansk republics. My condolences to the ukrainians that will risk their lives to try to fight russia
Ten facet serio tam jest? Czy tylko dla ładności/wiarygodności przekazu dał się wkleić? Bo na krawędziach jego postaci odbija się green-screen...

Sigma Putin ain't playing no more lol but where's the NATO and the us and and i remember just last Friday they were talking shit and stuff but they ain't doing nothing now just talking what a shame lol
De-Nazification?
USA, UK, NATO??? SEND UR MILITARY TO UKRAINE. DARE U???
It is a nice thing to sympathize with the Ukrainians and the oppressed peoples, but have you seen the Palestinians how bombs fall on them daily and their desires settle every day?  Why doesn't the European media react to this and condemn the Israeli entity, or your use of the media and sad music in the videos to gain people's sympathy with Ukraine and its regime because it belongs to Europe and America, damn you misleading media.
All of this because of  dumbass Zelensky who is now crying for his life to Carl Nehamer via phone.Aren't you the one who said you are ready for everything and we do not chew etc? Americans played you like a fiddle.All you had to do stupid is say: we are not joining NATO, we are not setting up American bases here, it would not be right for our Russian neighbors, and in the end it would all be over. Now as you laid, so you will sleep. I'm just sorry for Ukrainian people paying for your dumbassery.
NATO is the true world agressor...
Come on men save people going to died
Stay strong Ukraine.  My prayers go to all innocent people who are affected by these actions.  🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Slava UKRAINA🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
Non of this would happen if the left the idea of joining NATO in the first place.Now for this stupid reason thousands of people will die

Please stop war please
Ukraine stay strong🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
Putin used the N word.And sent a blitzkrieg over many cities in Europe. We are gonna see his country fracture to pieces and a Ukranian mother will push the lever to feed the ocean his bones.
Russian invasion is justified no matter how horrible it seems to invade a nation, the casualties... Ukraine should've stayed neutral. Imagine the US's reaction to Russian Misses in Cuba, Mexico or anywhere NEAR the US just as US wants to do to the Russian Federation.The whole point of Ukraine joining NATO is so that US can put missles even closer to Russian borders. Who is the real aggressor? Why do Americans feel the need to put bases everywhere?
People with brains knew Putin was lying, people without brains believed Putin that USA was lying.
This is a disaster, but what will America do now?
Ah the modern Hitler has appeared... Sad... All the best for Ukrainian ppl!!!
If we stand by and only sanction russia Ukraine 🇺🇦 will be lost.
Hopefully any civilian save, even its impossible. Volodymyr ego sacrifice his people. We would do the same if our neighbor invite our biggest enemy to his house.We Indonesia 🇮🇩  stand with Russia 🇷🇺
Mr potatoe head joey o Biden and his woke globalist pals got thier war

I really feel sorry for innocent people killed,but question is where was international community when US and their allies killed millions of people around the Muslim world.
Putin is a diabolical maniacal pos. Putin has strong grip on his people's, like Stalin, they can't get rid off him
The Ukraine gov, ignore all the warnings for many weeks,  instead of guarding the entrances where the Russians were entering.  They all sat back now they want the west to fight for them. They were given all the military equipment, yet they did go to the forefront to say to Russia do not come any further.     Ukraine cannot win, they should surrender at this point
Czar puti shows his true face, the face of Russia, a little man with a huge inferiority complex.  Europe better wake up, now!!  Poland,  Lithuania,  Czech, Albania, Georgia, Romania all better be prepared cause Puti wants his kingdom back.
Quit being a pussy and station a sniper outside his compound.
pure evil.
If the west gets involveds you and I will die
Here we go again, and the invasion starts and man fails to have peace again.  Good luck uk
Still don’t think d Minsk agreement was a good idea.? Russia was a patient as could be.  Instead usa kept building up Ukraine military with  tech, Russia can not have along its borders.  All had do was not put such military tech in Ukraine n honor Minsk. But usa n nato did opposite.  Now running around in media all butt hurt. Psst usa n nato nations.  . Prepare to get a bunch of military trained nazi extremist refugees fleeing d conflict.   those terrorist Putin is hunting will cross polllinate with your domestic terrorist!  Good luck with that! Ya got selves reverse colonized
U.S quick to attack weak nations but scared of Russia

What is the role of UN in this  case.they only watch the whole thing. Praying for innocent people's and childrens♥️♥️
NOT AS BAD AS THE WHO ATTACK ON ALL HUMANITY WITH A C0V1D SCAMDEMIC!!
Putin is such a guy that once he decided to fight he fights until win or death. Therefore, for ordinary people, please Ukraine surrender immediately and end this war as fast as possible. That is the only way I'm afraid.
7:00 This guy got balls of steel speaking out to Putin.
Putin  has gone crazy
U.S & their NATO boyfriends scared of Russia 😱👎🏼 why you sending troops if you ain’t going to do anything to Russia. Also in Syria U.S was bluffing against Putin so stop all your BS military flexing 🤦🏻‍♂️However, Afghanistan defeated Russia, Taliban defeated U.S and NATO 🥴🥴🥴
My heart goes out to the Ukrainian people. Stay strong, Be safe
The Ukrainian people need to rise up and fight back especially against the Russian sympathizers (traitors) living amongst them.  Other wise this will never end

Love to Ukraine from Finland! 🇺🇦 🤝🏻 🇫🇮
Wth is wrong with Putin?!!
It's because of you USA 🇺🇸 I HATE YOU
Appeasing Vlad worked as well as appeasing Adolph.
I am unlucky , seeing this break seen which is place of love for a family.destroying hospitals school home with any reason can't be justified.
Putin, for God's sake, stop this absurd and ugly invasion. Nobody wants a war. Even Russians don't want this. YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE WHO WANTS THIS MEANINGLESS AND FUTILE WAR!
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is wrong. It is an act of aggression. Numerous Russian military helicopters over Hostomel town in the Kyiv Oblast. Looks like a Russian Air Assault has started. One of the things the 20th century taught us, very expensively, is that it's a mistake to appease dictators who invade their neighbors. The world is coming to an end... With Dictatorship on the rise.... China, Russia, North Korea and Africa.
who's helping ukraine? none? by praying nothing gonna change the evil person mind, GOD just looking at this mess...and watching innocents are being killed is normal for GOD..even he doesn't care
Well i am sorry to see this but same time to all ukraininas… just a year ago you were supporting another dictator, the one of azerbaijan. And putin that attacked and took over ancient Armenian lands… how does it feel now…. Well this is how!
And this is FAKE media bbc.
War is never a solution. This is the ego and selfishness of powerful leaders. Stay strong Ukrainians, let's hope for good and prayers for peace.Also, war hurts a lot. Loosing loved ones hurts more than anything so don't just prioritize the sorrow of developed countries. Take time to protest against war in Yemen and Palestine also. They have been suffering since a long time. We want peace and harmony all over the world. Peace ✌

So Sad dictatorship to do that down Russia 👎Glory to Ukraine 🇺🇦  Russia will get in shocking consequences
Sad thing our incompetent president doesn’t realize that Western Europe has been making Russia rich by buying oil from Russia so all the sanctions won’t do much. Trump tried to produce oil to keep European countries away from Russian oil dependence but Biden came in and stopped it all. It boggles my mind people don’t realize we protect Europe from Russia yet Europe pays Russia big money for oil. It’s like protecting your friends from a bully but your friends are paying the bully for lunch.
Might have some chicken kievs for dinner. In memory of Ukraine
Oh my god….
🤬
The nazi calling his victims nazis. The final insult. The west gave this monster the green light to invade. We learned nothing from WWII.
Who will benefit most from this war？
He also said he had no choice but to invade as west didn't pay attention to Russia's security threat....
Lets see what usa will do

Commiting financial crimes all over the world on the surface and interior 24hrs a day on the code numbers of the stolen Dutch 3 Blue Chips via the internet/ uranium plutonium and cryptonite used with electricity as crystal detectors and skimmers and decoding aiding devices on social security numbers bank accts and human nato ID. World Citizen Chips. The promise of the rainbow is in effect in Jesus   Name Amen.
I beg God for people to see through all of this Fake news. The media is the enemy
Putin cannot be trusted!
Ww3
Russian
Yr blessings and prayers will not make any difference. Told yr NATO govt to act fast! Especially if u r American! Told Sleepy Joe to act, not ignoring tyranny. Bunch of hypocrite.
Stupid Ukraine government made big mistake by fighting with big neighbor relying on distant sponsors
Sure mate just another Russian mission of mercy like when the Reds invaded Poland from the east in Sept 1939 to protect ethnic minorities. What BS. You see Nazis under every rock like Vlad.
Sending out peace and love to all...We are one human family. Prayers to all in Ukraine.
Начиная 3:40 с америки на брайтон бич нашли, да еще и не на украинском, а на английском дает интервью!)))))) Где ваша национализация, чо не на украинском разговариваете?)))))))
If only the us still had a president
I hate war… the innocent people suffer the most 😢😢😢😢
Here we goooooo. The end.
Stay out of region and SAFE
All i can say is stay on yall side of the world with that we get along just fine in the americas and the Caribbean
As much as it will cause destruction and chaos globally, Putin must be removed with his whole cabinet.
Why do a number of reporters continually pronounce it 'Keev' rather than 'Kyiv'? Have they never heard it spoken before? or is it some woke bullshit?
west supplied arms to radical elements in ukraine for its agenda against russia then blames russia ...they all do it ..the west and russia ...no one free of sin here ..if you think otherwise your naive
Who the hell believe in this fake news ?
We stand with Ukraine spell Putin
Where is NATO and Europe hahahaha never listen to the enemy of your neighbor.
Those aren't tanks. They're APCs and trucks. Russia uses T34s for their MBT. Anyways, this sucks, but makes sense, since the Russian state is in decline and is trying to bolster their economy and national identity. Don't be surprised when China invades Taiwan. This will be a coordinated operation.
2022We are all spectators still.No one does anything.
Cuba next.
Heart breaking....feeling sorry for civilians
Long live Ukraine
Sent the seals in and make putin dissappear

Hello 👋 Europe , are your hands still under your lazy spoiled ass!? 🤔
I still like the Russian people but I don't like their military and I don't like their government that being said besides heavy sanctions I think the Russian should be excluded from the Olympics as punishment as well... The world will remember this in Russia will be paying for it well after Putin is gone
USA and Russia both are responsible if there is loss of lives in Ukraine....I feel...both are powerful countries and they must be responsible for war and peace...They should focus more on peace instead of war...they must solve the issue by peace...Ukraine must cooperate with these two countries and solve the issue.....It is also true nobody wants a lion next to his house....
Americans ans Britain's are cowards for allowing this to happen. The two most powerful countries being clowns and doing nothing
Isnt Ukraine the birthplace of the Rus people?NATO started it by meddling right at Russias borders.Russia should start sending weapons to Mexico and Canada. Then it becomes fair and square.Ukraine is a corrupt country where Biden donors are located and where Hunter Biden had business dealings.Ukraine in the last 10 months locked pro democracy activists and shut down numerous television and news paper outlets that were critical of corruption in the current Ukrainian government.
NATO It's going to fall apart like a card tower. Half the countries that are in Nato hate The American army and they are in nato is just for money.

Kamala went to ukraine with stern words, she let putin have it with her clever strategic mind. What a good job she did so proud. What an amazing bright light bulb. Words cant describe her incredible effectiveness
The globalist got their war

Kiev hears sirensEveryone: oh poor Kiev prayers with the civilians. What a humanitarian crisis. Israel shoots disabled child in the headEveryone: that kid was asking for it.
Why don’t Ukraine millitary air strike Russian vehicles while they on the move .
Is Ukraine fighting back?   Where are the bombs going back into Russia?
And for what ?!?!?! GO GET SOME BOTOX
Too bad our democratic leaders are so weak and stupid, we could of helped prevent all of this.
I see now the Covid fearmongering has finally subsided a new bogeyman must rise to keep the populace in fear and dread.
I keep on getting $14,000 every week from a new trading platforms in town.
May the safety Ukraine deserves become an attained right that is deserved. This is a enigmatically heartbreaking proof that ALL OF HUMANITY NEEDS TO COME TOGETHER FOR PEACE AND THOSE WHO OPPOSE THE TRUE FACT THAT WE ALL DESERVE TO AIDE IN THE PURSUIT OF UNDERSTANDING REALIZE FORCE, THROUGH ANYTHING BUT APPARENT FACT, IS A DIGRACE OF THE LOWEST FORM.  No man or woman gets to decide or force another man or woman to be submissive. THAT IS TRULY DISGUSTING! If you are in Ukraine right now, know this, MEDITATE, ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO MEDITATE. Defend your freedom and lives at all costs but don't beseech the battle. I love you. I may not know you, but I love you. And you deserve safety and comfort. This is truly another moment that can be used as a lapse in human nature, Russia is not fearful of Ukraine. Russia is trying to capitalize on the lack of international turmoil and expand their boarders. This news is truly SICKENING!
It's the Ukrainian pronunciation as opposed to the Russian Bruh
May god help Ukranian people..
This conflict is kremlin want not russian people want..But press(bbc) want both if it
So Putin follows in Hitler's footsteps.....
Massive Deaths And Destructions In This War
The west won't do much to help Ukraine physically because it's not profitable for them but they will put economic sanctions as a front to show how 'angry' and 'appalled' they are.Hope Ukrainians stay safe during this.
What American leaders waste trying to control what they know they can’t, making America’s debt & problems worse. F’n idiots.
#saveukrainesavepeople
It is so easy for politicians to declare war .. but only civilians and soldiers suffer from the consequences of war … where as politicians remain safe and in worst case they run from the country in private choppers loaded with money … like Afghanistan president … stay strong Ukraine !!!
I FEEL SO SORRY FOR THE POOR NAZI IN UKRAINE.....
How the hell does an elephant not feel safe from a ant? I actually thought Putin was smarter than trump. I see their IQ is about the same
This localize war will end shortly without the West and US mafias intervention. After all, Russia has all the reasons to repossess Ukraine. The West and the US can keep their threatening sanctions to themselves. Ukrainian shall stay calm for a change and a better tomorrow.
Electing Obama...a fatal mistake for Amerika.
I hope this shameless attack from Russia's army will come to a swift end! The Ukranian people don't deserve this
Putin have no friends in Europe anymore. We need to unite NATO and counter attack Russia and Belarus. Take out their regime and kill all of their soldiers no prisoners!
God bless Putin
No worries, Sleepy Joe has it under control……….
Why aren’t some reporters not wearing helmets 🪖?
They have no proof of that s being Russians. America has been trying to start a war for years so this could easily be America
O
That's what happen when you become the friend of your enemy. Ukraine should have listen to Putin he is right about having his enemy next to him so he should attack.
GO PUTIN...WE STAND WITH YOU HERE IN US AND CANADA
That guy that said if Putin doesn't stop he will start the 3rd world war. Uhmm I hate to break it to him but Ukraine didn't join any alliance, so it will just be a war between Russia and Ukraine. If NATO gets involved it will be a world war. I think NATO Nations will be reluctant to help, because I assume if one NATO Nation takes action to help Ukraine it will drag the other NATO Nations into war against their will.
How is Ukraine such a “threat” they literally have a bunch of civilians with not a lot of war experience and Putin has stationed over 150k troops around Ukraine ? This is overkill correct ?
This is terrible 😢 my heart goes to Ukraine people ♥️
Ukraine is loaded with Nazis
Ffs why Putin? Utter idiocy and more poor, everyday folks will suffer. Great job d@@khead
I want to leave Russia so bad. I hate my country and the government.
People from Ukraine come to india , we will welcome you
Putin is not a president!!!! Call him what he is!! Dictator
They ere just on exercise, but just happened to be in the right place for unprovoked Ukrainian aggression, because the Ukrainians choose to be aggressive at the exact moment Russia had large well positioned forces on their border.   Russians are buying it, I’m not.
You can thank BBC. They pushed for Brandon president now we got one😂😂😂 just remember you voted for Brandon you voted for this.
Why would he not invade when he knows the whole world will literally do nothing about it….
Ukraine is a failed nazi state sponsored by US!🤑🤑🤑 They must be stopped!✋ ✋ ✋
some nukes can solve the humanity problem permanently a clean & green earth
😢😢😢😢
Take care, good people. This includes all the good Russian people. I hope this does not inspire China to follow the examples, otherwise... This will really end up as the 3rd world war.

I'm curious what the Russian citizens think of their leader when they see this... anyone who can answer? Edit: I mean the news stated it but a much more detailed answer would be appreciated.
Anyday now and the usa will  experience karma for the blood shed caused on earth.
Putin is terrorized by Ukraine ?  What a whimp ! !
Violence is the last refuge of the incompetentA wise russian said thisOh, the irony
How simple was it to say - We won’t join NATO
Go USSR , 💚💚
NAM must assert itself and convene an emergency meeting and strongly issue a response to this crisis.  I request Mr.Modi to take the initiative  and encourage NAM member countries to assert themselves and speak up!!
I did laugh when he said from east to west because of ttairo, Instagram, But my heart goes out to everyone in Ukraine. Keep safe
There is no such thing as democratic, if someone is threatening you and your family (Ukraine was joining nato, Russia sees that as threat).
Unfortunately this is how the world of politics works fighting over territory and we can't do anything about it but just hope its will just end already if the war gets worse you could either die like a dog in the streets
He's one of the worst.
Putin really is a shit.

Fuck off and don't censor me, we areFighting for freedom. Your as bad as that animal Putin.
I don’t understand why this crazy president of Russia putin
No to wars of billionaires of the world but to towards  social revolution in Europe to stop catastrophic  billionaires wars and the climate change, capitalist system is a destructive and suicidal social hierarchical system.
It my sincere hope that what Russia gets from this dastardly invasion is body bags! Lots, and lots of body bags! Stay Strong Ukraine!!!
Well, I suppose now it's a different world. I didn't think he'd do it. It's not rational to me.
Stop the son of Devil
Good...
Year 2022 and this crap is still happening 🤦‍♂️
They should have stopped this before it even started. No they just let Putin spread his military all over the boarder setting up to attack and tried to make idiots think it was just a test.🤦🏼
I hate this crazy World!
This is  sweet  the BBC backed and showed  the Turkish invasion of Cyprus  have supported Turkey  ever since  and now pointing the finger at Russia
Putin is a kind of antichrist, determined to drag the whole of Europe down to hell with him. Good news, though, he will totally fail. Like Lenin and Stalin before him, he will die in mysterious circumstances. Dictators never make it to old age!
WWIII here we come
every one cry in  the war zone apart from weapon industries.
Putin says this is all act for self defence 😂this guys nuts
Peace is the answer to all wars, please keep everyone soaking in peace.😔😔😔
My heart goes to Russian people. This is such a difficult moment and situation. Stay strong, safe and hopeful!
No gun
Im so sorry my deepest condolences for the loss of loved ones and their families.
panic!   Ridiculous  BBC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
Ever since Crimea this was coming. Putin is the new Hitler
Please China : stop this madness this will affect you to
Ukraine is a victim of USA and Russia...I pray for Ukrainian people...USA and Russia please take some responsibility..

Just by listening to the news and seeing this video, my eyes started to cry none stop, I feel their pain and worries and I pray that God may stretch his mighty hand and stop the war, God be merciful, forgive and save your people.
🙏🏾
We are praying for the Ukrainians.
Putin is not a strong leader as he is a coward. Stalin in the 21st century.  All is not perfect in the USA but we kill terrorist he kills dissent.  Scum
U a troll
Excuse me what , their scum are you ok it's like supporting the Nazis have you seen what they plan to do once they take control my guy they want to persecute and that is it

What? Russia is attacking Ukraine, unprovoked.
Russia has caused this. The dictator running it is no different from the ones before him
 @TAM2031006  who is forced them to do this? America 🇺🇸 open your eyes !!!!!!

Cant believe this Doby Rasputin could be our new Hitler 🤦🏼
don't turn this in to a world war
NATO, European Union and USA are all freemason, illuminate countries. They don't care about Ukraine. They deliberately teased Putin to attack Ukraine. These puppets of illuminate wants to bring chaos, destruction and pain upon humanity.
Ukranians are feeling betrayed by NATOs.This is a charactor of West.Now they are talking about humanity and trying to  hypnotize world by using  highly moral and  decent words for ukranian people   .while every one knows how brutal west have been with palestinians by allowing Israel's to go with all atrocities against plestinians  .No one is going to believe US and her band even its allies dnt trust them.
Не теряйте рассудок сейчас. Теперь необходимо остановить войну. Война не является решением, и она будет расширяться, используя многие проблемы, которые в нее вливаются.Братья, будьте за мир. Не будьте рабами широко распространенного мнения, которое призывает нас занять позицию. Идеи зажигают разрушительные огни. Пусть идея мира будет вашей.
Putin is modern Russia czar. We don't need another world War. Shame on us, we haven't learnt anything from world wars. If 3rd world War  will be fought, then fourth world War will fought with sticks, spears, bows and stones.. Stay strong, Ukraine people
So sad, 2 brothers of slavik fight each other,speaking on same mother tongue but now aiming at brother throat. Remember ukrainians,this is also West fault.  Because they put air defense system  in russia border n try make u member of Non Action Talk Only, innocent ukrainian forced to pay that price..
Thanks to USA & Their weakest prez. #Joe_biden.....💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩...
I hope that the war ends and the war does not cause much damage.
And this is the result of giving up your nuclear weapons.
Bbc is just a propaganda tool of western power. Amazing how they try to shape the opinion to attack Putin instead of attacking Russian. They go to Russia but only show those who are against Putin. Regime change in Ukraine is coming.. Sorry to say but there will be nothing that NATO can do without risking WW3..and no western European people want to have world war because of ukraine. Russia has made up its mind, you could only join them and be at peace with them or against them. Putin has given 8 years..and they take him as a joke.
If you're going down at least put up a fight
Zelenski western puppet  u must go
They just drive into Ukraine? Where are the border guards?
India must attack on Pakistan occupied Kashmir where hundreds of UN designated terrorist freely move and killing Indian people and create constant threat to India's security  ....India should learn from Russia.... I hope this so called 
Ukraine should just surrender the girl was right, no more penalties
Earth belongs to every God's creation and this isn't a game for any Hitler to destroy it. Every humans kind has right to live on this planet journey and every air travel is just a mere travel. War need to be stopped immediately! No single human has this authority to take control over the whole world. Just living everyday isn't enough? World should protest and not only Russian or Ukraine. This is really a worlds worst human travel on planet earth. Ungrateful by might of superiority, bring him to powerless country and know how human been existing. Tongue and mind alone shouldn't wage War nor by machine to destroy human emotion, existence. Wasted generation? Really a terror to whole nation and Putin alone shouldn't decide. Every single living being exist too. Pride of one's country strength is simply a tragic end of human history. Are we still looking to survive on different planet even when we cannot love here on earth. Saddest part of life is this.
Putin = Afolf Hitler
In war is nobody the Winner, sad to see, that we have a war again in Europe, the history goes back..I wish u all ukraine good luck.Greeting from a normal german guy
It breaks my heart seeing if my grandparents hadn’t left we would have been dead in this attack
War will just cause destruction and horror nothing else... Why they can't see that
Putin dead war ends
Putin's Russia murders innocent civilians as vp Biden sits on his thumbs and services Barack Obama...ain't it great to be in Joe Biden's Amerika!
Here are the Thots in Prairies
What a load of bullshit. Stock footage from multiple locations over different time periods. Who are you trying to fool?
The bloody west attacked Afganistan ,Syria ,Libya ,Iraq etc ....they called it shock and awe ...Russia is getting rid of the western pest
They are asking where NATO is to help them... well you can have a short war or a long one which would you prefer?

I pray for the Ukraine people but that weasel president of the Ukraine needs to get lost he sold Ukraine out to the nwo
Sign me up I will save Ukraine
The war may stop if NATO don't expand any more. Why can't NATO guarantee that? My heart goes to all the sufferers
NooooWAR!!!!!!!!
Putin is a liar.
If bustard america can attact and  a destroy a country (like iraq,afganistan )  that situated thousand of mile away from it and send it back to the stone age... Then Russia's excuse of security threat is more acceptable as   they are attackicountrng neighboring country
Finally we get to see call of duty: ww3 and it's totally worth it
We should not be surprised by this.  Belarus and Ukraine are Russia's absolute redlines in Europe.  They need a buffer zone for their security concerns.
♥️🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺👍
This is sad for humanity. Why can't people just live in peace? People bust their buts to build a life for their families and here comes the government destroying everything that you have built.

Who saw that mustang tho👀👀 2:30
Wheres their army,
I respected Putin but not anymore.Even Lucifer was once an angel.
I am a concerned citizen of one of the democratic countries. Who the hell cares what they've predicted when they DON'T DO ANYTHING TO PREVENT THE NARSEZIST Putin!Their harsh sanctions are a piss in missisipi that the NARSEZIST Putin is completely indifferent to. Cowardly West leaders who hide behind USELESS SANCTIONS and TALK a lot of CRAP that they call diplomacy. This behavior has given narcissistic Putin free rein just as Chamberlin did with Hitler.DISGUSTING GAS BAGS TO WEST LEADERS WHO NOW ALLOW PUTIN TO INVADE UKRAINE! These cowardly leaders should be trusted to protect the rest of Europe. I think NOT!
God plz save civillian.But the war will stop if Ukraine will not alliance with NATO.To the people of ukraine russian is ur brother why want to left russia(ussr) n to join NATO.America is just talking only don't believe there decision.Afganistan civillian are too suffering bcoz of america.
The scariest thing is that the areas that Putin is hitting aren’t even in Donbass
Russia
news channels are creaming rn
Joe Biden used war mongering to kick this crap off! Nothing gets a president re elected better than a war! Ever wonder why he pulled from Afghanistan so fast? He want a real war to stay in office
just go around them
Get to know Jehovah God before it's too late.
How are you puppets of USA
bomb shelling on residential area is totally unacceptable...russia is going on israel path....killing inocent people is cowerdness...
Why
Thanks to NATO, and US for this peaceful solution to Ukraine .
So sad😭😭😭😭
NATO is not going to help and let's be clear Russia is not Afghanistan. Messing with the Russians will probably be the last thing most countries will ever do. I feel for the civilians in Ukraine, because of the irresponsible ballistic statements made by politicians and unfounded faith they had in being accepted by NATO this situation had to arise. I sincerely hope the dumb politicians would stop making further ballistic statements against the Russians and come to peace and settlement. Nobody literally nobody will ever come to your rescue (people of UKraine) by risking a war with the Russians.
China will hit Taiwan next in a week or so..
great chasing nato out of ukraine. No nato nuks in ukraine, peace in europe, soon its safe and back to normal.
nahhhh that made me feel sick
Lol
Actually the attack was only on to the military bases. Check out cgtn and rt to get a balance view. BBC is known for propaganda
Hypocritic BBC
So much for putting up a fight... Looks like Ukrainian military has just stood aside, maybe their leaders aren't as popular as the media would have you believe
Russia lives in fear?? There fkin huge.
This scary, a possible gateway start to WW3.

Perhaps the soldiers you're filming, in line with Vladimir Putin's recommendations, are going home to their families.
Putin, the Grand Thug of Russia.
Part of your country men calls the neighbor to save them. Give access to your home. The neighbour comes and says you now belong to him. You are happy and tell him to bomb the rest of the country. You are safe for now right. Just watch out if you meant what you called for.
Even though russia is invading ukraine, why nato doesn't move? This war is crime.
World forced Russia to do this
Ukraine is not part of NATO. And Russia doesn’t care….
What's wrong with Vladimir Putin???😡
Kharkiv overcast all day today, the images of the firefighter up the ladder is not from today.
Corrupt Europe donated in the dark, so much is our money, 17 billion euros to Ukraine, the people have not seen one. Do you really believe that Ukrainians are willing to be slaughtered for a bunch of pro-Nazi oligarchs with overflowing accounts abroad or for a puppet who came to power and immediately corrupted? Ukrainians will not fight for these corrupt, Putin knows.
F’ck your praying stfu. Be angry, show anger. Show how much you hate this instead. Praying for Ukraine is basically the same as being indiffrent, and holding no one accountable. We all should unite against russia and tyrranies.
Now Ukraine's civilians pay the cost of NATO's provocation towards Russia. I hope you're happy, BBC. How's your rating?
... It is not Russia that destroying Ukraine.. It is USA and NATO that had Provoked Ukraine to Join NATO.. Because USA wants sales it's Weapons To Ukraine only.. This was USA Plan to Sale it's weapons. It can happen only then if USA and NATO Provoke Ukraine against Russia..... This is the fact... Think it
That's what happen when you wake up a sleeping Bear. NATO should mind their own business.
Russia better no attack NATO soil. They'll only be sanctions for Ukraine, but if Putin attacks NATO it's over for humanity.
Zelenski will flee to Us leaving his people...vote for him again if there is still Ukraine next year
That is evil act!
This  is because of the west going to every country in the world. Butt then. Don t help. Don t trust the west no more. Poeple using poeple to fight there war
Ukraine should just give up, and stay alive.
27 countries of EU means 27 armies plus USA army  can stop Putin. Unfortunately no one cares until the West will be attacked. It will be cold shower for the West. Watch and wait.
War is not right
欧洲的燃气要涨价了、电费也会涨价，尤其是德国🇩🇪，另外许多从俄罗斯🇷🇺进口的原材料产品会涨价，进一步影响需要这些原材料的产业。
I laugh in Spanish bcos Russia does not know what is coming ahead of them but surly they will lose no man can eat food many people prepare for him ...when Putin eye clears surely he will be sentenced to death that one for sure ..Putin remember what happened to Hitler in word war...u want to repeat the history as worst president of  your century too bad oo

May Almighty God take control for the protection of innocent souls I pray
Can't believe people still follow BBC. Those media have shamelessly provoked and added oil to spark the flame.
Are you going to give in to Russia and China? 😡😡😡
Sanctions ain't gonna cut it anymore ffs. The world need to take military action
NATO and its puppets tasting their own medicine. LETS GO.
PUTIN warned NATO for over 30 years to NOT put weapons to russian borders, but they expanded 5 times and took al previously russian country. The agreement WAS to let these country's as NEUTRAL ZONE, but NATO was taking over these country's. They want Russian and russian OIL and GAS....
Stupid biden n uk
Where is NATO to help. Well they’re just finding out what NATO stands for: No Action Talk Only.
Keep making a joke out of urself bbc,ofcourse innocent will try to flee,are u that dumb ?
It's all Ukraine's fault why insisting to join an alliance that is threatening to It's neioughbers. In my opinion It's a call for war and they got it.
history will remember u piece of shit !
Shame on you Russia ... Feel for all the Ukrainians...
So it begins..
Go Russia 🇷🇺 🇷🇺 🇷🇺
My goodness…
They did get a warning at least. good luck to Ukraine
Hello! Who are you?🤔
I like how Putin lies “we will not harm innocent people” Reports: civilian casualties are being reported
BBC PROPAGANDA MACHINE
Collateral Damage.
Haven't you heard? These people are Nazis so it's ok.
Они сами виноваты, сказали сидеть дома и то что по города не будут бомбить, а только стратегические объекты.

Great one sided  propaganda  XD
Warrant you put it in illegally the Prime Minister of Ukraine by George Soros that’s why Putin want you out
We are united - America
Where is God?Why won't he punish Putin..
We want Peace in the world 🙏
Your prayers are useless to them. Instead of praying, we could raise funds for Ukraine. NATO countries do nothing but look at what is happening, this is not normal and correct.
Putin is a pussy, why don't we get the public out and drop a big boy on Russia just like japan
Хай живе Україна   from Azerbaijan 🇺🇦🇦🇿

WHY ISN'T U.S HELPING UKRAINE TO FIGHT?
That’s one wimpy ass missile strike lmaoo, Russia is gonna get rekt
Shame on america America always leaves his allies alone😡😡😡
These insane world leaders who are willing to cause the deaths of untold numbers of people (military and civilians alike) for their deluded nonsense.  Will it never end as long as there are people on this planet?  Will we continue to allow individuals to decide when thousands to millions of people die for their ridiculous whims?  When do we as a species decide that no man's political ambitions are more important than human life and put a stop to this?  Is this an immutable part of the human condition that megalomaniacs can take control and cause such death and suffering?  I consider the deaths of any soldier or civilian, Ukrainian, Russian or otherwise, to be nothing less than murder perpetrated by the very few people who have ordered these actions.
no war
Western propoganda the Ukrainian SSR was a founding member of the Soviet Union in 1922 . Ukraine there after became part of the Soviet Union on the USSR. Ukraine and Russia both were originated from the same USSR, culturelly, and religiously, language wire both must have lot of similarities. If same thing happened  on America, British,  India or others country what they doing against you❤❤❤❤.
The sounds of those horns!!!
Everyone paints Russia has the bad guys but surely the west ain’t telling us the full story bbc is always going to be one sided
People are not stupid with you selective interviewing of the Russian public give the real news and god help both sides and don’t make matters worse for these people
Putin is lying
Russia can’t do anything bc they feel a constant threat?😭🤣🤣 make that make sense
BBC and all the other media outlets are pathetic. Remember Israelis are killed, Palestinians die. Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and Palestine are not a humanitarian crisis. But Ukraine is. Russia is literally doing what America and NATO have beeb doing for decades. I hope they keep going.
Selensky, alter gauner, fahr nach hause!
Stop this evil know
This feels like a nightmare , can't believe it's happening. If they attack NATO then this will be ww3
BBC propaganda
wow
Stop the drama Queen BBC.....it is useless..
Desde Madrid: Estoy con vosotros .Resistir. !!!NO PASARAN!!!
This is what happens when the State (Putin) controls the media.  Without independent media, he was able to convince his people that Ukraine is a threat and start this genocide.  The Russians have been committing genocide for centuries, but nobody wants to call them out for it.  This is why every country around Russia needs to be part of NATO.  By the way, China is just as dangerous.  Countries surrounding China also need a mutual defense pact.
Ukrain will easily invade,because people of ukrain are not patriotic at all, invasion is coming they  just chilling, they dont  take seriously…Now they pay the Price for not loving their country 100 percent…..Do as Afgan did ,no surender, defend till the last man standing….
may putin and everyone that moves into war for 
It's always the ballsy women of any nation that stand up to the thug & say - NO ! They, carry the grief & distress of war ?
Why poke the bear , when you know it will obviously bite back . Ukraine should have just stayed neutral and have good relations with both the west and russia. Why in such a hurry to join nato, when you know russia will never allow Nato to be so close to it's borders. ukraine have useless, egoistic politician's, they are the ones to be blamed .This unnecessary war could have easily been avoided .
Prayers for Ukraine from Holland
I hope we aren't next :( Im from Estonia
Prove it was self defence ?
ITS POLITICIANS WORLDWIDE WHO DESTROY OUR HARMONY
Ukraine has become a battlefield for russia and america
😢
Putin is a bloodthirsty bully. Ukraine is a sovereign nation that didn’t do anything to deserve this.
Praying for ukraine
Problem is Putin is unstable enough to go I have lost nuke it all
Anyone else notice that none of this happened when trump was in office my heart goes out to them
Russia - you should be utterly and wholly ashamed. Putin clearly isn’t but the Russian people should be.
Everybody is just praying bla bla bla, pathetic🤮 Ukrainians are fighting for us all
Putin, Russia 🇷🇺, nato is a real terrorist who destroyed all those countries syria iraq Yemen Libya and so many other countries.
Why WTF??????
LA Desgracia mas grande donde hay mentes retrazadas..eignorantes .matar al hombre,pir otro hombre por una guerra imberocimel ..donde sufren los q nada tienen q veer..y son los psrticipes ,peor librdos..se destruye el mismo hombre...
It seems, for now, that Russia does have free reign in the air. I don't know the size or capabilities of a Ukraine airforce but looks to be no show from them at the moment. Is there going to be any kind of counter attack? The numbers that are often stated to be under arms for Ukraine is more than enough to be a v powerful force,,. Not anything like what Russia has to hand but capable enough to serve up a bloody nose to anyone. Depends now how far the  Ukrainian people are personally prepared to go to resist. Being in a situation where your very life is on the line does wonders for concentrating the mind......
BBC bias news!
I see these comments are filling with the same spammy comments about USA and war in the Middle East, that we saw in 2014 after Crimea.Just so you spammers know; that’s not an actual argument. If you’re trying to justify Russian invasion, you’re failing at it.
No! It is the Ukrainian leader who has destroyed his own country.  He did not listen, he was arrogant and thoughtless when offered a diplomatic solution by Vladimir Putin.  He sided with NATO, Russia's greatest enemy to Russia's national security.   Now he will pay the price and be ousted from his position.   I hope Ukrainians will remain safe and not so many killed.   If NATO interferes with Russia's operation, we will have a 3rd world war and the end of civilisation on earth as we know it.   It is not a NAZI occupation by Russia, it is Russia defending it's security from a reckless Ukraine.  It is Ukraine that has been Nazified by NATO.  Ukraine has been brainwashed.   Vladimir does not want more than Ukraine so don't listen to media lies and propaganda, telling people that Russia will not stop with Ukraine.   The normal people of Russia don't know what is really going on with NATO and the real threats that Russia faces.   Of course normal Russian people do not want war, nor does Vladimir Putin.   Vladimir Putin did not want war and NATO knows it.   NATO just wanted to try their luck with Russia and it has back fired miserably.   It is not NATO but the Ukrainians who will suffer.   To compare Vladimir Putin to Hitler is an insult to the whole of Russia and Putin himself.
The Ukrainian gov. Needs to push everyone willing to fight to the front lines so Russia knows they are serious. Rain down HELL on Russia and who ever els wants it
Its too sad but important to clean the proamericans antirusshians for the welfare and  best economy to the honourable people of Ukrine and whole asia.
One sided view!? Being parcial along with misconceptions not understanding what where n when all started it out...

Self defence!? You senial old man. Self defense is only used if you are attacked first. If any sane person believes Ukraine attacked first you don't belong in a democratic world.

This is what happens when a little twerp runs a country.
Ukraine president only had to say NO to NATO ...... but he said they would pursue membership. Zelenskyy knew Putin would not tolerate expansion. Now Ukraine will collapse ..... only to be helped by U.S and European money laundering operations. God bless ....  hopefully Putin will get rid of Western puppet Zelenskyy.
US/UK 1-2 wks before: we believe there is an attack, invasion is most likely Ukraine: we're not worried, but we're readyNato: oh well, I'm sure they won't but whateverPeople: Blame US Blame USRussia/Belarus: Only Military Exercise People: yes we believe you, US is just stupid, UK tooNowPANIC PANIC PANIC PANIC EVERYWHERE
Putin the tyrant blathering about denazifying Ukraine? Sure Vlad maybe you forgot Ukraine has a Jewish president?
Please stop the war 😭 sending my prayers from Indonesia 🇲🇨🇺🇦
They should of not got rid of there nukes...
I wonder when nato allies will respond 🤔 its only Russian common lads 😂.. 10 years in Afghanistan with all Nato allies with big shame back to pavilions.

Let's go Russia
NATO is the real enemy of the people,NATO was controlled  by X NAZIS after WW2.....NATO just wants a military advantage next to Russian borders,NATO does not care for The Ukraine
They want WW3
How can this man sit there knowing he’s killed god knows how many innocent people including children.
We should first read about The real reason for this war. If there were some issues regarding water supply Ukraine should have solve this by talking to Russia now it's getting worse. Pakistan should also understand if they keep poking India this will also happen to them.
As the politicians start the wars, they hide in Their bunkers protecting themselves why the innocent citizens deal with the consequences... I just wish the people would wake up & see the bigger picture.. We are better off without Politics.
My heart does go out to all those in need :( so sad. I can't imagine how they feel.. insane to think it's happening right now as you read this

you have our full support ukraine we are in this fight together from england :3
If we don’t stand up to Putin the baltics will be next, just like Hitler promised he’d stop at reclaiming German territory’s lost in WWI, he didn’t stop there.
This is ludicrous. 2022 and we’re on the brink of another world war. I hope this lunatic Putin gets his comeuppance
NATO get out there and light em all up
They asked two civilians in Russia and the bcc assumes everyone thinks alike
Should not have become a Nazi country. Oh well, it will calm down soon and all the Nazis will flee to Poland, or UK.
This happens when you have a bad leader, people suffer.
🇮🇩♥️🇺🇦♥️🇷🇺
When NATO becomes useless
Pobre pueblo ruso, pobre pueblo ucraniano.  Putin culpable.
I disagree with the gentleman stating if Putin isn’t stopped it will be the beginning of the Third World War. Stopping Putin from protecting its sovereignty, means further involving NATO which is the reason for the current situation.
Thoughts and prayers for Ukraine. I hope everybody makes it out safe, I cannot believe that this is happening in 2021 of all times it’s horrible. Please to the people making jokes about what they’re going through, please stop. This is real. People are in danger and are dying so please be respectful to those who are in harms way. ):
STAY SAFE:(
Be careful people this can be the start of WW3, after russia occupied ukraine china gonna do the same to taiwan and hong-kong, so does north korea invade south korea the communist will not let go of this momentum, so does US they will not let communism spread more. GOOD LUCK PEOPLE !
Does this mean world war?

Pass me my mask an Cape I’ll be landing in Ukrainian in 5 4 3 2 1 touchdown The comments section is still praying
Ukrainians are wonderful and the country is really nice, I pray that the west steps in to put a powerful stop to this, the sooner the better
Is Moldova safe?
When the master left his puppet a lone....Civiliance pay the price
USA forced RUSSIA to act. USA killed  innocent people morethan any country after WW2. Thanks to Sleepy President of USA. 🤭. USA and her puppets left no choice to attack since they fully controll Ukrain which will be bad for RUSSIA.
It will be very bad if civilians died in this conflict ....and after Ukraine russia wont stop
Live and let live russian must show big heart we know russia a powerful cpuntry but dont show ur power on inocent ppl of the country...

Get ready for War, Blokes and Non-Blokes.

So this is the start of WW3
Fake, probably caused the explosions themselves and reporting it to fulfilll their western agenda.
Can Russia deal with 10's of thousands of NATO troops permanently on its border? That is what Putin has bought himself with this and there will eventually be a head-to-head shooting war between Russia and NATO. Putin must be stopped here or he will be emboldened to do far more.
As a South African I pray Russia  take control 🙏 USA  influence in the region is bad
Yeah its all the Kremlin...US, NATO,UKR threatening Russia has fuck all to do with anything! Fuck off BBC.
Nuke Russia and China now before u regret it
Dude 5 Russian jets and a helicopter were destroyed and a Turkish civilian navel vessel was blown up by Russian jets why don't you shut up faker.
WAR IS NOT THE SOLUTION, NO ONE GAINS POOR CIVILIAN AND MILITARY LOOSENING. LIVE AND LET LIVE ,PEACE AND MAINTAIN BROTHERHOOD IS CALL OF DAY AFTER ALL WE ARE HUMAN BEINGS. STOP KILLING HUMANITY.
Had the west ie the USA had not interfered this wouldn’t be happening
Our prayers with Ukraine! Azerbaijan support Ukraine!
This is very worrying. Russia is very unpredictable and also have the backing of china
Guess Putin lied
Time to attack Russia's unprotected flanks to rid Russia of its Psycho DICK-tator... and their criminal government.
A full-on assault as the west is portraying means that guy wouldn't be standing out in the open. That's the calmest city I've ever seen in my life. The weakest propaganda ever!
What the hell a the Ukrainian,NATO  and the American government waiting for strike back at them and hit them hard
Come on guys, it's a mostly peaceful holiday across the border. Admit it BBC, if Putin was Leftwing, you'd be defending him like you did Hamas when they launched 10,000 missiles into Israel.
OMG !😲 😱
This won’t go well for Russia they couldn’t even manage to take Finland when it was a communist powerhouse under its mythical “leader” Stalin let alone now with its aging technology and economic stability of Monopoly money.
This Putin is really a maniac.. can't trust that guy..
I feel so very sorry for the people of Ukraine. Great Britain stands with you Ukraine!
This makes me so emotional 🥺
“It’s for self defence”  What an idiot
Man,This is 2020 Can we not forgive and forget.The world is smart enough to unite to be a better place for all.God Bless.....
Ukraine needs the help of NATO.😥 They want freedom.
It still would of happened ukriane was always destined to fall to Russia.
I don't understand children are dying and Russian doesn't give a damn
I honestly thought he was bluffing
War Is War & any & everything becomes a moving target too destroy !!
It was the brits and yanks that did it
Im with RUssia on this war, but instead of boming the city Putin should just bomb vladimirs house directly and end it in an instant.
Prayers for the ukranian people, may Allah protect innocent civilians
Putin sitting next to the red button I hope the west don't get involved
This battle look like Afghanistan ( Ashraf Gani )Government  it's for Russia just a peace of cake 🍰
This happen when other countries let dictators do what they want for years... for 20 years in this specific case.Our energy and gas will cost Ukrainian people lives.
OMG...that is heartless
Even after pandemic life still these countries are showing interest on war. As a human beings we do not have right to kill others. I am really looking forward peace and happiness to both nations.
Stop all war plz

Putin is putting an end to the NAZI NWO.
Funny how the translations are total bull*hit nd not evn close to wat thy are actually saying
Isn't killing civilians considered terrorism?
How can an agressor claim self defense. This is the biggest joke of all times!!! God bless Ukraine and I hope the rest of the world wakes up and help them in their earnest need

The pandemic narrative is starting to fail, this is a new distraction.
The Pope is a Apostle of Peace n has appealed for Peace.. Hope wiser sense prevails.. But these Foolish Leader's like Putin are autocratic n Power Hungry.. Probably NATO may move into action mode very soon, for if they don't nip it in the bud now, then they know very well that Putin cud b the modern day Hitler..
Russia and Ukraine must be United against aggressive west.Honestly, it is not Russia and Ukraine war in fact it is Russia and west war. West is using Ukrainian as a tool.
how about every country NATO and US invade bruh? what u say about that?
FUCK. PUTIN.
Stopping sanctions isn't going to do anything Obama did that and then they slowly came back so Biden looks super weak and he's not going to do anything about it.
Disgusting
😞 This is what happens when you turn your back on the Russian bear. The end of the Cold War was just the start for Putin to begin rebuilding the Soviet Bloc! Who’s next after Ukraine? Poland? Romania? Bulgaria?
Self defense? I kinda see this the opposite of it. Putin if you are saying your country is under attack you might be still having memories of Germany of Hitler taking most of Russia in WW2 and the whole world fought to stop Germany from world domination.
A tip from a former activist. Stay low to avoid the excessive damage from shrapnels. Avoid rooms and do not lean against walls due too shock waves. Children often forget this and the results are beyond horrifying. Wear protective headgears or headphones and cover your face & neck with the correct placement of both hands and arms. Stop your car and hide as low as possible. Do not face towards the bomb except for your feets and stay away from windows.  Make sure you are in posession of a first aid kit and flashlight. As a former activist for the opressed Palestinians & MENA I feel sorry for you. The adrenaline rush and terror like fear when bombs drop indiscriminately on civilians by the opressors is something very few of us will ever experience. These images still haunt me. Don't run in the open and check the Protection guide against Aerial Attacks. Flee as far away as possible from the blast radius. After the bombings there will most likely be an air and ground assault. Soldiers wil murder civilians, medical personel, journalists and activists. Depending on the importance of your country, the reliable sources will update the world about the status of war crimes. Top priority is surving the bombings and air assault. Do not be ashamed to flee your country with your family. I've seen many now and many before who had to do so, while the world watched and supported the slaughtering of those same people. Stay strong 👊🏾
I can’t see any other outcome from this other than Russia becoming a 3rd world country
There is only a difference of thoughts between two men concerning a particular subject. Dealing with it physically with weapons and anger won't help. 🙏🏻 The war history isn't enough? We're in 2022 and can't be sophisticated enough to live in peace? Covid-19 is enough! We will self destroy all of us if we continue like this
SO SAD, I WISH YOU LONG LIVE AND PEACE UKRAINE.from SOMALIA
I wonder how much the USA paid for this remarkable distraction
pls watch 
My prayers from Chicago  to the people  of Ukraine......may god protect u all....shame on the devil....No matter what goodness will triumph over evil...
Vladimir Putin is an evil dictator that needs to be held responsible for what he has done.
1:16 
Mr.Biden is held responsible for Russianmilitary operation! Now, NATO shoulddeclare non inclusion of Ukrine in their military alliance immediately to stopunnecessary bloody conflicts.

Prayers for a swift end to this conflict. May God have Mercy on the innocent.
Subject: Kissinger on UkraineHow the Ukraine crisis ends By Henry Kissinger  PUBLIC discussion on Ukraine is all about confrontation. But do we know where we are going? In my life, I have seen four wars begun with great enthusiasm and public support, all of which we did not know how to end and from three of which we withdrew unilaterally. The test of policy is how it ends, not how it begins.    Far too often the Ukrainian issue is posed as a showdown: whether Ukraine joins the East or the West. But if Ukraine is to survive and thrive, it must not be either side’s outpost against the other – it should function as a bridge between them.   Russia must accept that to try to force Ukraine into a satellite status, and thereby move Russia’s borders again, would doom Moscow to repeat its history of self-fulfilling cycles of reciprocal pressures with Europe and the United States.   The West must understand that, to Russia, Ukraine can never be just a foreign country. Russian history began in what was called Kievan-Rus. The Russian religion spread from there. Ukraine has been part of Russia for centuries, and their histories were intertwined before then. Some of the most important battles for Russian freedom, starting with the Battle of Poltava in 1709, were fought on Ukrainian soil. The Black Sea Fleet – Russia’s means of projecting power in the Mediterranean – is based by long-term lease in Sevastopol, in Crimea. Even such famed dissidents as Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Joseph Brodsky insisted that Ukraine was an integral part of Russian history and, indeed, of Russia.    The European Union must recognize that its bureaucratic dilatoriness and subordination of the strategic element to domestic politics in negotiating Ukraine’s relationship to Europe contributed to turning a negotiation into a crisis. Foreign policy is the art of establishing priorities.   The Ukrainians are the decisive element. They live in a country with a complex history and a polyglot composition. The Western part was incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1939, when Stalin and Hitler divided up the spoils. Crimea, 60 per cent of whose population is Russian, became part of Ukraine only in 1954 , when Nikita Khrushchev, a Ukrainian by birth, awarded it as part of the 300th-year celebration of a Russian agreement with the Cossacks. The West is largely Catholic; the East largely Russian Orthodox. The West speaks Ukrainian; the East speaks mostly Russian. Any attempt by one wing of Ukraine to dominate the other – as has been the pattern – would lead eventually to civil war or breakup. To treat Ukraine as part of an East-West confrontation would scuttle for decades any prospect to bring Russia and the West – especially Russia and Europe – into a cooperative international system.  Ukraine has been independent for only 23 years; it had previously been under some kind of foreign rule since the 14th century. Not surprisingly, its leaders have not learned the art of compromise, even less of historical perspective. The politics of post-independence Ukraine clearly demonstrates that the root of the problem lies in efforts by Ukrainian politicians to impose their will on recalcitrant parts of the country, first by one faction, then by the other. That is the essence of the conflict between Viktor Yanu­kovych and his principal political rival, Yulia Tymo­shenko. They represent the two wings of Ukraine and have not been willing to share power. A wise U.S. policy toward Ukraine would seek a way for the two parts of the country to cooperate with each other. We should seek reconciliation, not the domination of a faction.   Russia and the West, and least of all the various factions in Ukraine, have not acted on this principle. Each has made the situation worse. Russia would not be able to impose a military solution without isolating itself at a time when many of its borders are already precarious. For the West, the demonization of Vladimir Putin is not a policy; it is an alibi for the absence of one.   Putin should come to realize that, whatever his grievances, a policy of military impositions would produce another Cold War. For its part, the United States needs to avoid treating Russia as an aberrant to be patiently taught rules of conduct established by Washington. Putin is a serious strategist – on the premises of Russian history. Understanding U.S. values and psychology are not his strong suits. Nor has understanding Russian history and psychology been a strong point of U.S. policymakers. Leaders of all sides should return to examining outcomes, not compete in posturing. Here is my notion of an outcome compatible with the values and security interests of all sides:• Ukraine should have the right to choose freely its economic and political associations, including with Europe.• Ukraine should not join NATO, a position I took seven years ago, when it last came up.• Ukraine should be free to create any government compatible with the expressed will of its people. Wise Ukrainian leaders would then opt for a policy of reconciliation between the various parts of their country. Internationally, they should pursue a posture comparable to that of Finland. That nation leaves no doubt about its fierce independence and cooperates with the West in most fields but carefully avoids institutional hostility toward Russia. •It is incompatible with the rules of the existing world order for Russia to annex Crimea. But it should be possible to put Crimea’s relationship to Ukraine on a less fraught basis. To that end, Russia would recognize Ukraine’s sovereignty over Crimea. Ukraine should reinforce Crimea’s autonomy in elections held in the presence of international observers. The process would include removing any ambiguities about the status of the Black Sea Fleet at Sevastopol.  These are principles, not prescriptions. People familiar with the region will know that not all of them will be palatable to all parties. The test is not absolute satisfaction but balanced dissatisfaction. If some solution based on these or comparable elements is not achieved, the drift toward confrontation will accelerate. The time for that will come soon enough.• Kissinger was secretary of state from 1973 to 1977. The article was first published in Washington Post.
The good old Zionist instigators will be looking for a good pay day sometime soon.
The sirens were a test. Ukraine stated so themselves. Bbc use it to make you think the sirens ment attacks
yawn
Fear for his job. You mean life
read the west cannot stand by and watch these people die Russia is going to fight the west eventuary now is the time to fight Russia

The only problem is America in this beautiful world
Putin and his nation needs sanctions like no other.. This sort of behaviour by Russia is unacceptable.. The only casualties of this war will be civilians who have the right to live in peace
Ukrainians stand and figh for your country
🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺❤️
The Global elite who run the world forsed Russia to start this war.Now all countrys will get involved in all out hell.Time to get born of the holyspirit.We have no fear and are all ready to give our lives for mark of the beast refusal.Come and cut my head off suckers.
Ukraine leaders knew this would happen when Ukraine tried to join NATO. When your neighbor joins side with the enemy what do you expect to happen
This show of unnecessary might will be costly for Russia in the long run
I really appreciate the decision and determination of Vladimir Putin. No one will be an obstacle for Russia. May God bless Russia and its people.
Why so many people don't understand that russian goverment and average russian people are different things? Almost no Russians support this war, protests are going in a lot of russian cities
Free ukraine 👍🇺🇦 Down with Putin fascism 👎🇷🇺
If it were any muslim country then everyone had bombing restlessly
Ukraine needs to demilitarized and then join Nato . They will have zero threat against Russia as Russia claims
Pray for Ukraine
Russian or Ukraine , just STOP THE WAR... (civilian any country  would not like  WAR ... ) WAR KILL HUMAN ,KILL economy, KILL CULTURE , DESTROY ANYTHING
One stupid phyco person who has got power on his hand can do worst thing that in human ever can do. Might for Russia Putin is a hero but rest of world he is just a DOG SHIT
Denazification of Ukraine? Is Putin stuck in 1940’s Soviet Union? Wtf is he talking about
1st I don't agree w any war to be a solution.As for the formerUS -Russia Embassador ，who is more a war hawk,By expanding NATO which triggers Putin that brought where it is today. And he suggested even more expansion.Very same situation,for the Pacific,China don't want sales of weapon to Taiwan nor calling independent as an informal unification in paper . However ,USA is pushing out more sales of weapons military bases expansion all around China!Sending out 3 carriers & exercise in front of China's door step,yet call that peace keeper! Same ,China should called USA as an invasion pretext as US called Russia to Ukraine! Fortunately ,China keep it's restrain.Or else,we will see war before Russia!Question should be asked why no parties actually try to set tone for peace , except France & Germany &China.Instead of letting war hawk countries like US megaphone the crisis.Also ask why &who will benefit all that....USA(leader politically ，while so many problems back home cannot forgotten,weapon & energy companies!!Bottom line: It* s all about $$$$
My heart goes out to Ukraine. Half the country is getting overtaken by Nazis and Russia is taking advantage. Yet again American imperialism has destabilized a nation and is causing a crisis
Nazis? You're in the wrong century mate.
@Anthony Cruciani  there's seriously a major neo nazi party growing in Ukraine. Worse more, they were funded by the U.S. there's many sources you can watch and read regarding this
 @Brandon Giordano  You must be a Trump fan getting your news from Infowars if you believe that. Ukraine has a Jewish president thus I doubt Nazis are too welcome. Putin like his orange buddy Trump is a born liar. Unlike Trump however Putin is very clever.
Indians support Ukraine
So has everyone been evacuated
Hope everyone is safe.  my heart goes out to the civilians.
let the world put an end to Russia before it gets out of hand
Waves of love to Ukraine
Well its time to send in the BIG GUN. HUNTER YOUR MONEY PIT  HAS GONE FULL COMMIE. TIME TO JOIN YOUR TRUE COLORS.
The agents of the West, especially America, still think that Russia is like Afghanistan or Iraq,,,, Russia will always remain the masters of the game,
Russia >>>>>>>>>America
Nato was formed by X Nazi members that got immunity after WW2 through 
Putin you will go to hell for sure😭
the US UK did this
I wonder how many people here who have said things like '' My heart goes out to Ukraine'' just want to get as many thumbs up as they can and don't really care what's happening .
Ha ha ha to all the idiots of the west your dominance is done he he he
The west should just make all out war against these children.
What a sad day for humanity! Senseless killings
NATO wants the world to believe it is not a military force it is a peace keeping force. Yet here they are stirring the pot. Creating false hopes to a president who’s seeking nuclear ambitions. Zellinsky was not democratically elected. He was elected by using intimidation tactics and murder. Don’t drink the cool aid. This is not a threat to western democracy. It’s no different from U.S. and Israel’s stance on Iran.
The west got brainwashed into 26 genders by the Marxists Zionists and now the Russians and Chinese will eat u confused tweets alive
My heart weep for the poor souls God be with you all
Putin is hitler

Why just the civilians…..?the Ukrainian soldiers don’t deserve to die.
 @Hooded Claw  Civilians didnt sign up to die in war. Soldiers did.
 @Mik  it is not about signing a contract, it is about Putin deciding if they are going to be invaded or not. More civillians died in WW2 than soldiers.
 @Happy 747  The guy asked why this person is just talking about the civilians. Most people are shocked when civilians die rather than soldiers because of the nature of their job/what they signed up for.
Ppl dead !
Your 
 @dev stuff  You do realise many Ukrainians are carrying on as per usual. Many of them are reading comments as they would normally do and seeing the support from other countries across the web. All the comments youre slating are probably doing more than you are.
 @dev stuff  Ok, we're really sorry!!! How dare we care about innocent civillians lives!!! We don't help them anyway so we shouldn't feel sorry about them!!!! You're correct mate we're sorry for being dumb!! Death to civillians!!! (Is this what you want to read?)
Russian soldiers need the best wish.
That's what happens when people dont have real life problems.
Hope Russia wins 🇷🇺 Poetin is right look for world maps from 30 years ago
Perfect Hitler propagation
Putin AKA the next Hitler
remember when the west didnt do shit when germany invaded poland? this is the same thing. russia about to go after all former ussr regions
Nato and US should destroy Communist Russian... and divide Russian into small countries
He only want the government he not trying to hurt general population wake up people it’s only obvious
My heart goes out to everyone that didn't ask for this, that was just minding their own business. Like wtf
Feel sorry for those innocent people.
So sad 😭
Wow two Democrat pussyhat woman said this is not the war they want, that means all Russians feel the same way,FAKE NEWS AGAIN
Don't kill innocent people pray for peace.
God bless
Where the fuck is usa man
Let them play man let them all fight loving this at least some of the countries can be left alone like Africa India and such. Why is the USA even getting involved didn’t they do the same thing in a Iraq and talking about sanctions you know.
God bless Ukraine . people.
I've woken up to sirens like that before (for a storm, not a war) and it is the scariest thing in the world. My heart goes out to ukraine.
The West needs to Bombe the shit out of Russia!!!!
NATO is responsible for all this ...
How come one can invade others in this century as well ???? People are just settling slowly after the Covid and this kind of acts are bad to the world.
All Russia is doing is secure their border from NATO
 @RJ P  indeed, Nato is worse, theyre ran by zionists
I h8 Russia, and I'm Russian
 @RJ P  Why bomb innocent civilians then?
RJ P Bombing innocent civilians they want to claim as there own citizens.. How amazing, a peaceful, innocent, Russian government just wanting to secure its borders from the oh so awful tyranny of NATO... Sike.
 @arun r  diddnt america use helicopter gunships to shoot groups of unarmed civilians?
Your 
 @Oscar 999  No no they were bringing democracy to the oppressed one bullet at a time.
 @Oscar 999  ok using one countries evil does not make another's ok, I hope you realize this, what Russia is doing is absurd, and what the U.S. did to middle eastern countries also had its flaws
 @RJ P  You have been successfully brainwashed by mister Putin.
 @下丹∪メ Ｊ丹ㄗ丹れモちモ  it seems you're drinking the wine of the mainstream medias and their propaganda 🤷‍♂️ good luck,  little one
 @dev stuff  oh you're so right !! Let me, a regular civilian from an entirely different country ring my phone to all the world leaders!! Oh the power that I have to stop military actions !!
 @RJ P  So 
 @下丹∪メ Ｊ丹ㄗ丹れモちモ  in my opinion,  he will keep it as a neutral region,  to make a large border from NATO.   But border issues is always a problem,  just look how Biden is managing his border crisis with Mexico
This is how Palestinians feel every day and have been for decades, America is funding and supporting Isreal while they do the same thing to Palestinians, this is also what people in Yemen are going through, America is also funding that.

Definitely the fact that now they are certain every time they hear any alarm or loud sound they know they have a high chance of dying
 @VessVFX  especially if a storm and war is going on at the same time u night thinks it’s a war starting
 @VessVFX  Ukraine will be nuclear ground of NATO if Ukraine join NATOAlso Ukraine is Part of Russia our mother landPutin have good move to Russian and Ukraine people United in one countyKnow the history first before comment hard here
No it's not, a bomb coming down on your family is worse.
 @Kendra  loser! Why can't people just be free rather than being under leaders. It's ridiculous.
 @Kendra  Putin aspires to be Hitler
Shut up you heard a storm warning and you compare your fear to people in a literal war
Stay safe..we sheltered your countrymen refugees during woeld war 11 ..wish and pray you are all safe..fr philippines
 @VessVFX  No, this has been the sound of danger since WW2, it’s the universal sound of danger meaning no matter where you are in the world you always know that sound means you’re at risk. Changing the siren would mean people who aren’t local wouldn’t know which siren means which. It’s eerie for a reason, that reason being that it’s the sound that millions of people have heard right before danger, some got to safety in time because they heard it and others sadly didn’t, it’s eerie because it’s a huge part of most countries history.
 @Soul  people could literally get a heart attack thinking it's a nuclear bomb but it's not like I can change it
Your 
It's coming to all of us soon goodbye
 @alkdjfhgks  just imagine someone live in part of your house and pretend that this is his house, but your a good person you let him live and make border on your House, but the longer he live more people to come and also live, and the long run they will destroy you, rub you and wipe youSo do you think you want this to happen while his alone?Ukraine is part of Russia read historyBlame the media who fools you
Where are you from?
 @Earf 🌎  the point of their comment was that it was already scary hearing an alarm for just a storm, imagining how terrifying it must for the people hearing it now in terms of potential bombings
 @Kendra  Russia itself is made up of multiple smaller countries.
Waa https://youtu.be/VDu3w1DqGhw
when israel, turkey and the united states bomb the syrian army that fights against terrorists nobody said anything but now that russia bombs military bases in ukraine everyone gets angry and annoyed, damn weak brains
And why were you silent when the Ukrainian army killed children in the Donbass? Why NATO couldn't do anything in 8 years? Why were you silent when the President of Ukraine broke the Minsk agreements? Why did you allow Nazism in Europe? Why did you keep silent when Ukraine announced the creation of a nuclear weapon? For the last 1000 years, only Russia has resolved all conflicts ...You don't think about security in Europe at all.
Some people are being critical of the original commenter in this thread.  I would like to point out some of the most powerful tornadoes that (EF4 EF5 strength) can be just as terrifying and destructive, even more so, as an attack by conventional bombers, artillery, or missiles.  Such tornadoes come with some storms, and heeding the sirens used to warn against them and reaching shelter is a matter of life or death, just like for people fleeing to shelters in Ukraine now.
Where are you from?
I WANT TO ASK THE UN A QUESTION!!!! CAN A CITIZEN OF KAZAKHSTAN OR A CITIZEN OF ANY OTHER COUNTRY SUPPORTING UKRAINE GO AND STAND TO DEFEND THE KRAJINA AND FIGHT AGAINST PUTIN'S ARMIES?
Thse should b stop imedietly...war is not a solution...country ppl suffer alot...
I’m surprised the BBC didn’t insist on everyone wearing masks.
UK and Ukraine are puppets of the US and so will be the whole of EU
Hard to believe that this sort of thing is going on in the modern era of the 21st century of smart phones lap tops etc..
Everyone in the comment section. Your thoughts and prayers don’t heal bullet wounds
~!@~!######@!#The Americans provoked the war between Russia and Ukraine, now the Americans have abandoned the Ukrainian people, and the Americans are only willing to pray for them
Thank you Russians.
This is an appeal from India kindly stop terrorising innocent civilians respect each other's sovereignty striking other's country and claiming as as an act of self defence doesn't sound reasonable have some respect for humanity there are old people, children, sick, homeless, disabled and more maintain peace we are all children of the world....
Talk talk talk talk talk enough!!!! what is NATO going to do the Ukrainians are sitting ducks they have called up the  reserves . Russia only have 20% of their forces there. Please God the Ukrainians don't heavily contest the land only engage in fleeting skirmishers do not lose your forces in a large scale engagement with Russia its unwinnable you would stand to lose your entire army let them puss you back to a NATO borders  Render  unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; . For now
1:30 this guy is Hitler's reborn.  His goal  he want the entire world and not only Ukraine.
Get me to Ukraine I'll foght

 @Deng Nicca  just because you wouldn't doesn't mean he won't
Self defense my @ss!!!
All the military that have flown over... no counter attack? Where is the NATO and Western forces.
So sorry...we allowed a fraudulent and feckless pedophile to be installed by Putin himself, with some help from China. But hey, no mean tweets.🙂
Only YESHUA can Save us from this kind of stuff.

Finally, something interesting happening other then.... 
Something not quite right here. Has anyone seen Unkraine fire one shot in return of this attack???  It makes zero strategic sense to simply attack unprovoked. Why would Russia go full tilt like this knowing full well it will spell out there end. To say that this doesn't pass the smell test,....is an understatement. Something isn't right here.
Children  need  love  food  no  bom missile
Russian and Chinese leaders should be assasinated
Biden can take the blame now acting tough provoking it talking like trump but dont have the guts to back them up
Horrible
They should have left the city earlier. Don't count on NATO ,EU or USA, they won't help you as they not only don't gain any benefits ,but also have to spend a lot of money if they send out troops.
Just pray they don't send our Kids to a war that has nothing to do with us.
0:00 On the morning of 16 February, someone played 
My prayers for Ukraine
where is the rest of the world?
This war is planned by the elites nato is not even fighting back .
wtf woke up to this on the news
It takes an invasion to stop school in Ukrainian
Is there anywhere I could see a translated version of what Russian news are saying? I’m honestly curious about it (Mexican here).
United States , u started this. Why the hell you don't understand this simple thing. U cannot abandon the war in the middle , because you are incompetent. Vietnam, iraq, afganistan. In war soilders die. If you abandon the war, civilians die. Nato should not have involved in this mess. If they want to, they should have supported Ukrain. My fellow humans without peace, we will not thrive. In pandemic, we all afraid for our lives. Imagine the suffering of the people who are in the centre of this. It really bothers me since I cannot do anything but talk shit in YouTube. I am really sorry my brothers and sisters who are suffering.
Why there is need if battle ....you can resolve all the disputes in peace sitting...let not people killed by missiles...
ukraine   most corrupt country on the planet
Sad sight https://youtu.be/Gqw2_FAwL58
Now you don't know whose jets were those?!  They aren't SUs those were western's.  By the way I saw some magnesium bombs explode. Those were old bombs like the one US use in Syria and Dombass.
Don’t cry after trying for years to get in to nato. Corrupted politicians have been played by the west and no help will come for them
Rip bozo
they cheat, they lie, they hack, they attack...and they will PAY back!
It’s a pity that the West can not do anything to Help or there might be a Risk of World War 3 and European Cities being taken out by Russian Nuclear Missiles
Ukrainians are beautiful and peace-loving people. They just want to live life under a democratic system.
God is coming back very soon get ready.
One despotic maniac is to blame, justice one day perhaps.
So the rest of the world is going to just sit back and watch this all happening? Ukraine people need help and Nato is doing absolutely nothing. Pathetic!
BRITAIN DON'T TAKE IN REFUGEES WE HAVE ENOUGH EASTERN EUROPEANS IN OUR PRISONS
Putin is evil.
It's not up to nato to stop putin. It's the Russian people's job to remove that cancer from power.The choice is theirs. Be Russian. Or human.
What is the world going to do? They need to help them
the west destroyed Syria ,iraq, Afganistan ,Libya  did the bbc and the world condemn  it ? The west is worse .let sanctions start with the usa for their atrocities .

 @Sümbig Dümkunt  You take care too
May God be with us all and Ukraine
Just becoz of nato.russia will not act if there is no threat review what he said before the battle are who is on the power of their country what he had done
They backed Russia into a corner with the west’s threat of nuclear weapon sites surrounding Russia’s borders
Shameful, liar Putin.
hmmm, All these diesel cars heading towards Europe... guess the environmentally aware people must be fuming..
Each one of those bombs means someone just going about their day is blown to bits. It’s not great that humans have to fight each other. We’re all the same guys so why can’t any of us get along?
I love you Vlad.  Viva Vlad!
Deceiving is an art of war...Putin strategy inspired from Sun ZI
God have mercy🥲🥲
Putin needs to be took out.along with CCP and North Korea..all have nuke's.maybe an emp strike and blame it on terrorism.
The fiction of Western diplomacy exposed.  If we wanted to avert this we might have taken a moment to actually consider why Russia are upset with the whole concept of arming Ukraine and adding them to Nato rather than snubbing Russia so blatantly.
After all innocent people are the ones that will be killed. why not just settle it amicably
USA supporting ukraine and killing pro russians in ukraine.Now USA crying : russia has attacked.If usa would would not have opted hypocritical behaviour with others, whole world would be standing with usa and nato.
Ukraine fucked with the wrong people
Stop pray where is nato who promised and leaded the way, its always the same, USA gives wings and stupid people believe and lead their nation in the trap, and then Biden say we pray for you ! What a hell. Where is usa there is death.
пхахах, пропаганда для умалишенных биороботов
Watching this is just heart breaking they not even thinking about the kids may god be with Ukraine
Ukrainian politicians are making mistake they should think wise and should have aligned with Russia rather than going with America
Stop the war  ,  don’t kill each other It’s your brothers and sisters . Politics is ok but not like this 🥺🥺🥺
Yeah @NATO
Yeah...  last time they did... Holodomor happened.
i am glad our dumbass prime minister did something right and pulled us out of there just in time.
My thoughts are with all the innocent trapped in the middle of this. My heart is breaking watching this. Everyone deserves a safe place to call home.

Self defense? While they are the aggressors Russia is no different than North Korea even worse cuz Kim havent attacked none except making threats
Damn 2022 trying to do one over 2021
We are seeing natural disasters because of the klimate changes. We don't need human created destructions like war bringing more death and suffering!! The world society has to get together and show Putin to understand that we are all in this earth together and we shoul help each other to survive as human beings and not to go back to the dark age of power play!!!!!!
WTF!!!! This is sad AF smh…. Talking about self defense… nah that’s pure evil
1:55 fear for his job? fear for his life
God help civilians and babies … horrible situation
I live in Russia and I am AGAINST THE WAR! This situation will bring a lot of grief to everyone. This war, like a cancer, must be stopped the sooner the better. This is not politics, this is madness.
The airport ? No one is their ! Putin is cleaning house Ukraine is zest pool of money laundering . My heart goes out to the innocent people . No matter what your not safe under corruption
Who wants this war? Damn it!
As an American I beg the leaders in Europe not to wait on the cowards in my government (USA) to lead the way. I keep hearing ppl hear say their thoughts and prayers go out to Ukraine but thoughts and prayers won’t save those ppl.
Attacking his own people how low can that monster go

I’m afraid it’s a step toward ww3 as Ukraine borders six countries and the Black Sea. I thought he was flexing but he really did it. Bombing airports so citizens can’t leave. I also think it’s a test to see who reacts and how. Just like I think China uses Taiwan to see how far we’ll go to protect them. Russian citizens are good people just like Americans are. We’re both stuck with our governments and can’t control how they handle wars. Russian citizens 🇷🇺 🇺🇸 🇺🇦 love you!❤️🤟🏻
Only raving idiots want a war. Very few people, in Russia or elsewhere, is that blatantly stupid. You are as much a victim of Tyrant Putin as many others, and my heart goes out to you, just as it does to Ukraine. There are no good leaders in the world today, only cowards and tyrants.#DefendUkraine

By Putin's logic, anyone can invade anyone at any time. I could come to your house and be justified in killing everyone there, if I

Well KGB will be tracking you closely
 @LindyLou  it don't matter either way
Its all the leaders we should get rid of . Normal people all over the world don't want war. How many protested against going into Iraq and they still went. It the agenda of a few everyone else is seen as unimportant to people with that mentality  let's hope average people get to change things someday for the better as we can't trust our leaders.
Thanks for being brave and truthful. The world knows its not the Russian people as you want peace like everyone else. This is purely power and what happens with a dictator. All opposition will be arrested and tortured. Putin is a cancer and needs to be removed. Unfortunately he has all the power and guns. I pray for all the Ukrainian and Russian people.

if your russian why are you not pissed about the genocide on your eastern Ukrainian brothers or why are you not pissed about Ukrainian politicians being arrested and some even killed for having different views from the Ukraine left wing politicians can you answer that for me

USA is forcefully in Syria that's an invasion, USA and UK plan support and ignored every UN violation for Israel invasion and occupation.  The poeple of Guam want USA military out they are forcefully there in Iraq they did not leave not to mention 20 years invasion of Afghanistan, there are many more you get the picture, I am not even mentioning the many governments they have toppled using the CIA like Iran, Chile. Please go read the many source of former  CIA agents . The USA supremecy has caused more death than the whole world put together since the end of WW2. The USA occupies most of Europe, the formation of NATO  was to keep Russai out, the USA in and the Germans down, thats the mandate of NATO. The problem here is poeple post based on emotions no facts.

The Nazi State of Russia is now clear to the world. Make no mistake about it. Russia and their entire society is the enemy of a of Europe, North America and the modern, civilized world. They represent what Nazi Germaby did in 1939. A Genocidal people aiming to destroy their neighbors.

My fiancee is from the Ryu Kyu islands (Okinawa) and she fears that quickly after this that China will invade Taiwan and that her home islands will be soon after.
But sadly my country got bombed by Japanese bomber too.😂I know that was the fault of politician, I don't hate Japanese citizens. citizens shouldn't be suffered by the game of  politicians. We just want live and enjoy our own life. Hope no more war in the future
@UCWYKHQNeAfuAP583b4FpKgQ 😂😂😂
 @Fennrir First  wasnt taiwan chinas land tho? It definitely makes sense to take back your own land.The taiwan lost the war, they shouldn’t have gotten anything, let alone their own country. When u lose a war u dont suddenly have claims to a random island.
 @The Sniper  Russia is attacking what are you talking about.
 @The Sniper  Russia is acting like an abusive ex boyfriend
 @Oscar 999  How about we let the people that inhabit it decide? They have. Overwhelmingly. They don't want to be a part of the CCP. At all. It's been a separate country run by a separate government for almost 100 years.
 @The Sniper  NATO Nazis? You are such a joke. If a sovereign nation decides to join a collection of countries that were formed to fight the tyrant Stalin that is that sovereign countries right. It's not for Putin to decide.
 @The Sniper  What do you call a country that doesn't allow you to make your own decisions on what to be? What do you call a leader that won't allow democratic process? What do you call an invasion meant to stop a decision that it's people decided for themselves?
Pray for the world
 @Michael Blue  Don't play the game with this Russian bot!
 @Fennrir First  Stalin been dead.... the soviet union been gone... why nato expansion?
 @Jonathan Miller  You speak of expansion like it's a war of conquest. A country decides and votes whether or not to join. NATO doesn't just absorb countries like the USSR did. NATO has 
 @Fennrir First  You're right.The japanese are very worried.I wish for your happiness from the bottom of my heart.末長くお幸せに✨
Let's go Dad putin 👏 🙌 we are with u
If Russia wins I feel as though he will just keep goijgb
Feel is a strong word.. It can cause misunderstanding.   lol.. I feel this but isn't the reality LOL.. so should we feel?? Should the law feel?
1:38 
Lesson learned here: be decisive next time. If you want to join Nato, do it fast before the enemy bombs you.
everyone bombard his twitter with fuck you Putin @KremlinRussia_E
The ukranians have been duped by the west into a war with russia forgetting its their lives on the line now the west has resorted to puting their tails between legs and barking around loudly as lives are being lost
Why didn't anyone condemn America and NATO for the attack on Yugoslavia in 1999, without the permission of the Security Council they bombed Belgrade, peaceful cities in the heart of Europe ... buildings, they killed so many children, civilians ... EUROPE DIDN'T REBELL !!! Now NATO AND DAMN AMERICA is moving to occupy the borders around Russia, every day more and more armies and weapons are on the border of Russia. SHOULD PUTIN ALLOW IF THEY CAME INTO HIS COUNTRY AND THEN IT WOULD NOT BE AN OCCUPATION BASES AROUND THE WORLD LIKE AMERICA AND NATO ... WESTERN MEDIA SAYS RUSSIA AGGRESSOR ... RUSSIANS ARE JUST ASKING FOR NATO NOT TO EXPAND NEAR RUSSIAN BORDERS .... SO WHAT'S AGGRESSIVE THERE ... WE WILL MAKE MORE AND MORE EXPANDS 
My Heart and Mind and Soul is with you Ukraine.💜✝️💜 God Bless y'all. If I could, I would fight with My Ukrainian Brothers and Sisters. 💜💜💜✝️💜💜💜
You should have voted for brexit see what you started now the kings and queens run this world along with the lizards they don't care about bombing and killing people that's what they've always done you're a slave so shut up and stop crying
Why have war everyone loses people lose loved ones limbs lives they once knew of theirselves homes schools this is evil I feel for anyone effected by this stay strong
My heart goes out to the brave Ukrainian soldiers defending their country. Patriots. Stay strong.

Putin, GOOOOO AND FUCK YOURSELF,
The world reject you !Your friends abandoned you ! When there is no hope !But when you believe in the unknown and unseen , the God Almighty ... Jesus Christ ! He always loves you no matter what , no matter what you've been ! Jesus Christ is always with you when you believe in Him .Believe in Him and you will be saved . Amen 🙏🏻
End Putin.
Putin is just another hiltler but good will always prevail. Our prayers are with you Ukraine
Why do these evil people keep murdering innocent people?? The leaders should fight it out and leave the people out of it!!!
I have a bad feeling that this could turn into a blood bath pretty soon.

 @dev stuff  you’re saying this everywhere, just shut up
 @Alan Ford  You’re so inept all you’re doing is repeating what Putin says. Yeah, good guy to follow.
 @Alan Ford  Elucidate further. Which one?
They should step down. Give up the two regions. That's going to be the endgame in any case
 @dev stuff  Russian bot prob
 @Alan Ford  Russian bot prob
 @Alan Ford  Also, how morally corrupt does one have to be to condone the loss of innocent lives over some old mans power insecurity? You sir are disgusting.
This is how Palestinians feel every day and have been for decades, America is funding and supporting Isreal while they do the same thing to Palestinians, this is also what people in Yemen are going through, America is also funding that.
Just saw a tiktok about no flights in Ukraine it said because they shut it down just found out its because theres no airports
Every inhabitant and friend of this world, hear the alarm of war, the trumpet call of God! For it is a call to repentance from the Lord Himself; a call to embrace He, whom you call Jesus and Christ, as He really is, The Father and The Son are one! The Word of the Lord has spoken to us, THIS last generation. More of this Word at the bottom of this comment;
ukraine president provoke war by inviting nato to Russian doorstep, victim is people of ukraine because of this comedian. economic benefit running by peace not by provoking war.
I've just been ignoring this stuff cause I always feel useless to do anything about it or help in any way. Just been reading the headlines.
Hell to Putin
God Bless the BBC.
Brothers whole world is with you! Dont run away in any case, fight for your home!!Slava Ukraini, slava herojima 🙏💪🇭🇷❤️🇺🇦
Wrong turn for Ukraine. You should have sided with your own people, the Russian.  Ukraine will be a battle ground and that's what America wanted. NO American want to die. American dream of WORLD DOMINATION.
Yes it's cruel but what would anyone do when you would see your Nation slowly getting sorrounded more and more by American armiesI don't support any of this but just saying...
This is horrible. The world is going to the doom. Pray the Lord for peace 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
🙏
My prayers to Ukraine  🥺
Chx
Putin can survive a short war not a long one.
Hey friends you probably won't be able to see this comment but what you're saying is all the governments are in League together all the leaders from all the countries around the same Mafia gang their own base is Switzerland the UN the ngos Lucerne the old kings and queens the SS from the German war guess what friends the old world order is just dividing up the new world order for their kids the ones who have never worked a day in their life and it's all alright they are Pharaoh's and Egypt it's too hot the desert so they have a winter home in Switzerland it's all very sweet and they're all still in charge and the men in blue it's a worldwide secret organization the red-white-and-blue has nothing to do with any of you the blue is here just to guard the red and the White House I know it's hard to believe Trump Biden Eisenhower all Swiss sleeper agents now you know the truth you probably thinks it's fiction they always Telluride in it's like looking for Waldo once you find them you can miss it call me an H&H call me an 88 Call Me 3 to 2 I'll be with you in a minute thank you
Denazify ukraine now
if you going to translate do subtitles, voice overs cover the truth
He's no better than Putin kettle calling pot balck
They can talk. What is the use of violence, i think since they have many weapons they wants to put into use taking the advantage. We are all brothers n sisters, this is what happened when a cruel leader rule.

The whole world isn't with them. We are here commenting
#ColdWar💥  #ColdWar💥 #ColdWar💥  I think again start  #ColdWar💥
And I thought we had made a lot of progress as a species since the WW2
Putin says 
Where is NATO now its too late most of the Russian army is inside Ukraine now where is NATO force only talk in media but no help
8:04  She got sense. Ukraine should surrender and reunite with mother Russia. 🙌
Let me attack Russia I might be 13 but let me in
This is so scary. This is the first time as a mum, war is closer to home than I've ever had and it worries me. How the people of Ukraine are feeling breaks my heart. Why can't someone just JFK Putin's arse. He needs to go and go out of painfully.
The west created all these mess....now Afghanistan n2.
Prayers for all Ukrainians and all those innocent people affected by this selfish act of war. This loss of lives is very unnecessary. Their lives cannot be bought back. Will the world see Putin as a Sadam Husain type and retake Ukraine and liberate Russia from Putin?
The man who came on a journey is troubled by death long live Ukraine
Sad. sorry God is with these people.
He look evil 👿!!
Khabib for president 🤣
How one man's greed & ambitious delusion can cause such pain & suffering on such a grand scale is mind bending. There is no justification for these actions. Have we not learned anything from our past? I am afraid, angry & sad. What have we(humanity) become? Are we destined to destroy ourselves? Time will tell...
Wtf is wrong with Russia
A 14 year old girl on a bike was directly hit looked intentional. Ukrainians are reporting that since Ukrainian military doesn’t fear them they are trying to spark fear in civilians by now attacking apartments etc.
Taiwan is next..
NATO too much words and no action Rusia Putin is a new version of hitler 🤦‍♀️
Humans they're like a fly to a light bulb
War will automatically subside when USA keep its nose out of it. After humiliation in Afghanistan, usa is looking for another battle.

Putin you are a criminal and you should be holding accountable
I guess Russia is making their own battlefield 2042
If Ukraine is not a member of NATO why is NATO mobilizing?Let us not forget this is the NATO who bombed civilian infrastructure in Libya.Who would want NATO as a neighbor?
You have it all wrong, as always. Since 2007 Putin warned the west to stop nato expansion. Noone listen. This blood is on you.
If this Ukraine hadn't given up their nuclear weapons many years, decades ago , they probably would have had a deteriant against this attack : What good does any 
imagine a king who fights his own battles, wouldn't that be a sight?
Over a million people marched through the streets of UK and other cities in the west. Many millions at home also against the illegal war and occupation in Iraq. Yet our so called democratic governments choose to invade Iraq and kill anyone that stood in their way and that included innocent civilians. We call for the release of Mr Navelny held by Russia but at the same time we had Mr Assange under house arrest and subsequent jailing and potential extradition to the United States to face what could be the death penalty. His crime,  for revealing the truth about the torture and murder of innocent civilians of Iraq, Afghanistan, Guantanamo etc.Constructive meaningful dialogue with Russia could have avoided this, however we choose to arm Ukraine with weapons than getting round the negotiation table. Many Ukrainian politicians openly voiced to acquire nuclear weapons and to join NATO, this was no secret. I can understand the threat Russia felt having a nuclear NATO power on its borders. It felt it was being backed into a corner and had to act to save itself.  I hope for once that our western leaders (and we know how Incompetent they are) take this sorry episode down a few notches for the greater good of the world and start talking meaningfully because a nuclear war is not going to end well. May peace prevail.
Was growing up in the east-block in Hungary. Everyone was happy when the Russian army left in '90. The thought would drive me nuts if I would live there and I would see the tanks coming back. It fascinates me that human psyche didn't change at all over the last million years. Fighting for territory is in the genes.
Ukraine needs the help of the world. Lots of love from Ireland 🇮🇪
I’m in disbelief.
On a postive note that was a nice mustang
Wow L Russia W Ukraine W yeat W Romania 🇷🇴
Isn't war to Ukraine only to every human who cares for freedom, sympathy support to Ukraine and Russians who is against to Putin and can't express them selfs🙌🏼❤️
western media is the fiction
Putin is the biggest liar
So the Russian people are ok with this
That used to be a common sight back in history. Doesn't make war right.

saddam invaded kuwait, nato strike back bombing proudly,  putin invading ukraine nato only talking loudly
Ukrainian President should not join NATO and declare the country a neutral nation.NATO WILL NOT BE INVOLVED.
8:04  She got sense. Ukraine should surrender and reunite with mother Russia. 🙌
This is what happens when you get rid of nuke .
When we hurt, maim and kill others, we are only hurting, maiming and killing ourselves. We are no different from the rest of humanity, we are the world and the world is us. It's our collective responsibility to find away of relating, to have some sympathy, empathy, some sense of sensitivity that understands one another wholy and not partially. Peace to the world💓
Im praying for the innocent people especially kids 😒
One day this world is destroy and people's are extinct from world because peoples fight and war  each other  😔😔I'm praying this two country peoples are safe 🤲 I pray their war was stop 😔♥️🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵
They're not even attacking Military installations, like wtf, I'm not even a Russophobe like most American politicians but this shit can't be forgiven....that being said this needs to be something America needs to try it's best to stay out of, Why? Because the worst case scenario is the beginning of WW3.
God bless Putin leader of the world,  i hope one day all world will be Russians 👍
Praying for Ukraine sending love from Indonesia 🖤🖤
Run fir your lives

Damn your hearts, thoughts and prayers, they will do nothing against Russian steel.

someone needs to get rid of vlad
Putin justifying his actions by making up lies about the Ukranian threat??..he talks about De-Nazification, but he needs to look in the mirror and he should see a German leader from the 1940's staring back at him.
Why, so they can be ruled by a shitty authoritarian regime and not be able to speak agaisnt it.
USA should step in, because do you think Russia is going to stop at Ukraine. They want to conquer everything. Hitler didn't stop at Poland.
Putin needs to go to hell . What a piece of shit he called it self defense?
Where are you America? Too much talk. Too much media... You make a lot of money again because of the war!!!
Fight back Ukraine! Die as a Ukrainian or live as a Russian! God bless Ukraine!🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
America always do this to countries to use it against russia and when the country needs usa the most USA leave it on its situation
thank god for russia the world was getting two soft.
I'm so disgusted at Russia. Relations will never be the same and I hope Ukraine pushes them back.
Vietnam, Cuba, Venezuela, Iraq, Syria, etc... WAS NOT INVADED by Russia.. YOU SOLD OLD fishes...Anyway... Russia will 'MOTHER' you all..
I started crying when I seen the baby boy in the stroller sleeping through this horrible mess. He’s so innocent and my heart just breaks for everyone over there.
New ww3
There are fire balls everyday in Palestine when illegal ISrahell bombs,  kills and commit genocide. Yet cute EU and US never talk about humanity, sanctions, invasion. How hypocrite you are!!!Now, you should also say, 
It makes me angry for this senseless aggression. Authoritarian government needs this to subvert the population in to their lies.
God bless Russian Army and China NWO

emotional damage damn it 😀😀😀
try to cry sometime for Yemeni children, Syrian children, Afghan children, Rohingya children, Iraqi children, want more?
 @Biswajit Sarkar  nah
 @Biswajit Sarkar  who’s to say I haven’t? Pretty ignorant of you to assume.
 @Biswajit Sarkar  yeah. But they won't coz USA is the culprit in this case. Hypocrisy of West.
 @HM   Ya, who's gonna know, who's gonna know.....
 @The Sniper  can you explain how USA is the culprit? I'm not from USA, don't understand fully what you mean. As far as I was aware this is Putin's doing?
 @Biswajit Sarkar  Shut up
 @ElizzoGypsy  I'm not talking about Ukraine, idiot. I'm talking about iraq, syria, yemen crisis. That ppl ignore coz USA is responsible for this. Example USA invaded Iraq just to steal it's oil resources.
 @The Sniper  but this is on a video about Ukraine and Russia??? Idiot! I don't know anyone who has ignored the previous invasions! All have been equally horrific.
 @Biswajit Sarkar  We cry for all innocents 🤦🏽‍♀️
Did you cry for the people of Luhansk and Donetsk? They were under fire from Ukrain for 8 years. Where were your comments that time?
 @Why Bother  exactly. All innocent lives are equal. Just because I said I cried for that little boy, doesn’t mean I can’t feel the absolute same for others. I know that people suck and people are probably use to it, but there are compassionate people out there.
 @The Sniper  also, correct me if I'm wrong, Russia bombed Syria too and many other places.
Good lord, this has gotten out of control. Please stop the blaming, everyone.
 @Biswajit Sarkar  well maybe she has...you are blinded in your hate
 @ElizzoGypsy  and Russia still is. Most violent corrupt nation on earth
 @Biswajit Sarkar  who are you to say they haven't
 @Echo Bay  agreed
Crying over that?? Sounds like you need help
 @GhostsAmongUs  well you definitely do
*saw the baby boy. Why is grammar so difficult?
bullshit. Your heart isn't broken, infact 5 minutes after watching this you went about with your life
 @Diesel Jimmie  did that make you feel better? Are you happy now? That seems to be what’s super important here.
 @GhostsAmongUs  it sounds like you need a heart.
 @dev stuff  well that’s life. I can’t just stop what I’m doing because something upset me, but okay.
 @Biswajit Sarkar  virtue signalling ...no one is more important than another ..no one wants this
 @HM  if seeing a baby in a stroller on a tv screen makes you cry that means you seriously have issues. It’s not like it was a body laying on the ground or something that’s different. People are so soft now
 @GhostsAmongUs  okay.
I also cried. Seeing that man with his cat just trying to get out. My heart is breaking.
fake
 @Anatolii Strelkov  okay.

Oh geez, so the kid is pretty much unshaken while the imbecile adults act like fools.
Dang I see a lot of people saying “but did you cry for these people? These people?” First, stop. It’s not the time to be arguing about that, this is about this. Not that. Plus you don’t know that person. Why argue when there’s people losing their lives right now, we all cry as humans to those innocent lives that are lost. All life. Just pray for those people, help, we need to stand together and not apart. Proving your point or anything isn’t gonna help. It takes 0 to be kind.
 @Ace Cards  🙏🏻
my heart breaks for those little afghan,  Iraqi, Libyan babies destroyed by nato bombs too
 @HM  it’s just insufferable to see people just wanting to argue or prove their side. Like what is there to prove? Yeah people died everywhere else, that’s heartbreaking. This is heartbreaking. Who cares if someone cried over seeing a broken father with their kid in middle of war, it hurts because we are human. Not soft, nothing. We are social beings. Why can’t we just get along it’s not that hard, it’s easier to be kind than trying to be rude or argue. Agree and talk about other life that has been lost in time. We don’t have to make our passions a conflict with others. Like damn. Most of these people are grown adults too.
https://youtu.be/VDu3w1DqGhw
 @HM  A “thank you” would be in order, actually
 @Diesel Jimmie  okay.

 @Маавия Хуссейн  Thank you! I'm not in China now so it's relatively safer. Anxious about what's going to happen now after the attack of Ukraine. The next would be Taiwan? Mainland Chinese people would also suffer for sure. It's already hellish.
 @stella canton   thank and see you. Hope everything cools down.Take care
Arrest the president!!!
cmon russia admit it you just want pripyat back for the tourist revenue
I hope that incompetent Joe biden is strong enough to break the Russian economy. How about syop flying planes into and out of Russia?Then no more commerce with Russia. No more oil or gas imports from russia.
😡😡😡😡😡😡😠😠😠😠😠
Defending ukraine is like defending Israel nothing to do with you who watch BBC and the propoganda
Ukraine u should not have believed US and NATO. No one support without profit. U should fight for ourselves.

God bless all the people of Ukraine🙏
General Patton words well be at war with Russia sooner or later but now thay have nuclear weapons and it's going to be so much harder to attack them back
Boom boom syria...
Of course you are finding Russian people who think this invasion is wrong. It is wrong, and Russian people are decent. They just have the misfortune of being governed by a megalomaniac who is willing to allow his own people to suffer, as long as it serves his ego.Vlad is upset that the only person in the world, other than himself, that thinks this is a good idea is trump. That's got to sting.No one is buying the trite and obviously false pretext for invasion that you're trying to construct Vlad.
Us the ally’s have done fuck all to stop putin and this is what we get. Our leaders are held accountable for these actions!
Wish BBC showed same enthusiasm while reporting about Israeli apartheid of Palestine.
Lets Go Brandon !!!!!!!What a schmuck
Immigration reform PROTEST in the USA!Every Wednesday for all immigrants in the USA !Refus to work,Don't shop,Don't go to school! HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS!!!!!!!!!!!
I feel bad for the innocent civilians in Ukraine [ the Ukrainian leaders areto blame for their foolish decisions against Russia
Stupid Ukraine will be die for American interests?Wanna dollars?Wanna Nato...and what now....?You will get destroyed country and desintegration
Down down Russia
Come on Russians, you need to stand against your government, this is your chance to remove him. Stand all together against this tyranny and stop it. Why are you all just sitting in your homes like your country isn't doing the worst crime! You need to realise people have power against this fool clown of Putin, pretending to be a president. He is not worth of anything. He is an idiot. Stop saying and pretending like you can't do anything. POEPLE HAVE POWER, not Politicians.
Why is nato sitting on their hands!?!?!? It's time to fight! Fuck that fake president Biden! He's not even America's real president! He won no election! Nato should do the right thing with our without Biden! American military should do the right thing while ignoring Biden! The beacon of light on the hill while Ukrainian civilians die!? Bullshit! This is how corrupt globalism has become. Everyone in every country needs to fight their own governments until they do the right thing. Better yet. Everyone in every country should treat their politicians like Russia is treating Ukrainian people. Replace them with real people! This is unacceptable!
Russia and China should both be crushed by the full forces of the combined world. Enough is enough. Death to Putin. Commies can rot in hell.
I just don't understand 😕
8:04  She got sense. Ukraine should surrender and reunite with mother Russia. 🙌
Those poor Yugoslavians.... Their countries going to be broken up into differences smaller countries... Europe should use the harshest sanctions on the aggressors.
BBC propaganda and also USA to
Vladimir Putin should be known as a war criminal because he's worse than radovan Karadžić
Russia's military needs to be destroyed.
My heart is sadden for this. I never thought I would see and hear a war in my existence. My heart goes to all of you.
ძირს ყველა მკვლელი და დიქტატორი მმართველი.  არც იციან რა მოელით მაგათ , გიტლერისნაირი დასასრულისთვისაა განწირული ყველა.

Ukraine president dont understand that putin wants only become there alliance but they choice NATO and US instead of Russia the blood and roots of Ukraine and Russia is one read book history about USSR history
All are losers.

wrong turn  for UKRAINE you should sided with your own people the Russian . Ukraine will be a battle ground  and that's what America wanted NO American want to die American dream of world Domination.
1932-1933: 7 million ukranians starved to death, thanks to the russians. Fight till the last man my friends, show the giant that you are tougher than they think. Finland did it, you can do it.
Russia is defending itself........Europeans have fallen into USA trap......sad sad
Russia defending himself? That's the most stupid joke! I don't think Ukraine is a threat to anywhere.
Snarling is greatest epithet for Putin yet.

Putin is pure evil.  Bombing civilian areas is a terrorist tactic.
Putin-nobody believes your lies! Prayers for Ukraine. Biden is a pathetic weak president.

Holy shit he actually did it...
Where the fuck is USA and Nato now guess they can only bark
Imagine the world without Russia China 🤩
May god walk with these people if there is one.
yes sadly i didnt hear the word terrorisme
I don't believe you no one believes you the BBC protects pedophiles. Nothing the BBC says is true don't be led into the third war the highest ranking freemason predicted 3 wars and this one is ass fake as the last 2
Against the democratic world..Says dictator Zelensky
pray for peace🙏🙏💔
There is no democracy in Ukraine.  Stupid President!  Become a real democracy and maybe you can use that word.
To the people of Ukraine, stay strong and never surrender make Russia regret the day they decided to invade the world is on your side 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
War is not a solution, many people will die #makepeacenotwar
These are Russian Jets doing a show of force but you know that dont you silley 🤣
The west has always been the aggressors and ever been provoking Russia. Honestly for several years I have heard Putin asking and pleading the west from building up military around and near Russia.Also in reality the west and allies have in fact destroyed more countries illegitimately than Putin could ever reach and Russia doesn't interfere or force their system or culture on other countries or people.
I just don't see a anything concrete.  Where is the invasion?
Damn devils ,,,you will be sorry one day.....may jesus protect the victims
To all the people who are supporting and empathizing with Ukraine just because Russia is strong enough to defend its security and attack Ukraine, shame on you
PUTIN  HAS  BECOME  A  DEVIL  NOWKILLING INNOCENT  PEOPLE.
If they step in it will be a nuclear world war, anyone would know that.

I think you are missing the fact that Putin has wanted to re-create the old Mother Russia since his employment as a KGB operative.  He is a dictator who has no qualms jailing or killing any political opponents.  As for not interfering in one's culture, just watch, no one is allowed to speak out against Putin, not journalists,  & not even Russian citizens.
 @Serendipity  whatever he has done or will do can never match the atrocities done by the west their allies.
I hope all who voted for Biden know you have blood on your hands ,,,,bless these people
Glory to Russia
Ukraine is not the place for US political games! Those Kiev politicians, who hold US green card, CANNOT speak for Ukraine nations! US uses NATO as the tool of war and threat. US supplies Stingers, Javelins, etc. to Ukraine via Lithuania. Those deadly, mass destruction weapons are used against Donbas and Lugansk, against our own relatives here!!! US initiated 80% wars in the world in 20th century:1950-53 - Korea,1964-75 - Vietnam,1967, 1973 - US supported Israel aggression against Egypt and Syria,1986 - US invaded Livia,1989 - US invaded Panama,1990 - US invaded Kuwait, 1999 - US invaded Kosovo, Yugoslavia,2001-21 - US invaded Afghanistan and left it to Taliban in the end (!!!)2003-11 - US invaded Iraq,2011 - US invaded Livia again,2014-17 - US invaded Syria.US violates international law, UN resolutions. US killed millions, and made millions homeless! THIS IS TOO MUCH! SOMEBODY HAVE TO TELL THIS: US GO HOME AND MIND OUR OWN BUSINESS!
I don’t exactly know what side to be on but all people are innocent. My condolences go to all that are struggling.
I think Ukraine surrender better save the civilians others side USA sending troops to more terrorists organizations attacking for the Russia
Why are we not seeing Ukraine returning fire?
Fuck sanctions.. america and other countries need to step in and fuck Russia up.. let them know this ain't it.. fuck war but if u start it let's finish it either that or cut Russia off completely
Greetings from USA my heart goes out to everyone in Ukraine, as innocent people are going to be killed and infrastructure will be wiped out for no reason, senseless
thanks russia you made up the minds of the country that has so far been neutral now they will join nato

Shame on the cruel Putin!!!
America,global cancer!!
This channel trying it's best to prove these attacks targeted against civilians but ......
That's why animals are million times better than humans.
Almighty God may you rescue the people of Ukraine
Please 🙏 help to Ukraine ❤️
Scripted fight????.......or real war???
Go Putin
I pray for you Ukraine ,❤️❤️🇺🇦🇺🇦
8:04  She got sense. Ukraine should surrender and reunite with mother Russia. 🙌
Not for a country who kills innocent people. Russia is in the wrong here
How about the side that didnt kill innocents?
I think your right
Were you so concerned when tens of thousands of innocent civilians were killed when your country invaded Iraq ?
 @Simon Wedgbury  - anytime innocent people are killed and lives disrupted I feel for people as a human being.
Obviously, Ukraine will lose this war if nobody helps it, And of course nobody will.If NATO or America would be involved, WW3 might start... So It might be end for Ukraine and it's people
All paid for by American taxpayers. Lets go Brandon!
Ussr
and Ukraine paying ... NATO enjoying ... provocative earlier, now left ...
NATO fully got Ukraine in to this situation. They kept on pushing the line that Ukraine will join and now the Russians are there where are NATO,  nowhere.
This fuckin idiot Putin needs to be handled with force by Ukraine they cannot allow Putin to come in and cause chaos in their own country
Russia must stop its aggression against Ukraine. Ukraine has right of existence and preservance of of ukrainian sovereignty is responsibility of international community.Hope for peace ahead from Pakistan
BRAVO PUTIN
Wtf Putin
There is nothing stronger than prayer 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻want peace and unity
Diz a russia que se sente amiaçada pela ucrania..lol..um pais que sempre defendeu a paz,que ate a pouco tempo a russia chamava a ucrania de irmaos! tanta falcidade junta! A ucrania nunca deveria ter disistido das suas bombas.Que Deus esteja com a ucrania neste momento terrivel.
there is a reason all the covid restrictions have lifted they didnt get what they wanted so war is now the back up plan what you hear in the news is bullshit.
by the looks of it Ukraine is the aggressor here. not Russia
GO PUTIN GO. PLS LAUNCH NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

This is Act of War NATO is Stronger Russia won't Win This
ض
😶
FUCK YOU RUSSIA! NO ONE CAN A LAND ECCEPT MOTHER EARTH AND JESUS... I HOPE RUSSIA WILL ERASE ON EARTH
The Ukrainian Allies need to hit him at the same time.
Ohh fake news. The same goverments that kept people inside for their own good are stimulate with news wars to killed more people the plandemia was not enought
Damn Putin is really a badass
This could be a scene from Iraq, Syria, Gaza, Libya, Somalia, Panama, Afghanistan which bbc cheered. Stop shedding crocodile tears hypocrites
May Allah guide the Ukrainian children and women
It's time to ACT and DEMAND the UN and GOVERNMENTS of ALL CIVILIZED COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD to STOP RUSSIA and, at least, to THROW RUSSIA OUT of the UN Security Council FOREVER and SUSPEND its UN membership until it stops ALL of ITS wars and gets out of ALL OCCUPIED TERRITORIES!  The NEW HITLER MUST BE STOPPED AND DESTROYED NOW before it ruins the world! Please WRITE PETITIONS to the UN and YOUR GOVERNMENTS demanding to vote in the UN for PERMANENT REMOVAL of Russian Federation from the UN Security Council and SUSPENSION of Russia's UN membership! Petition your governments to join the ALLIANCE to STOP AGGRESSOR RUSSIA, which started 7 wars and joined the 8th (in Syria) and occupied 5 regions of 3 neighbor countries within short 25 years of its independence and HAS LAUNCHED A FULL-SCALE WAR on Ukraine, which can turn into WORLD WAR III.
Russia feels threatened by Ukraine?! Lmao what a load of BS. Not taking away anything from Ukraine but come on, how are they a threat to the largest country on planet Earth? Looks like Russia is in need of some freedom. 🇺🇸
Its like telling the neighbour you cannot cook meat coz i am vegan..
What the fuck
🇳🇬🇺🇸🇬🇧🇪🇸 Ukraine president is so stupid to have let the Americans and Europe to influence him to join useless Nato were is the France and UK U,S and Nato no one will stop putin except the world need 3rd war war war
if CIA didn't coupe ukraine in2014 all of this wouldn't happen
Правильно🤝👍♥♥♥♥ Путин!!!     .Измени государства врага у Зеленский
Also let’s remember. Biden n his administration are the ones who have set up Ukraine. Biden n the rest are sweating bcuz Russia is going to find their dirt
Fiery, but mostly peaceful.
God is Watching you Russia
Russia must stop its aggression against Ukraine. Ukraine has right of existence and preservance of of ukrainian sovereignty is responsibility of international community.
I wonder what happened to Corona virus
Very sad information
BRAVO PUTIN
If you Voted Joe  Biden I hope your cheering for this. Hope you week self can be happy with your vote of a even weaker man
Canada must open it's boardes for any and all from the Ukraine
I hope peace
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION & THE ILLEGAL IRAQ WAR..... Where was the condemnation for that evil war that killed over 1 million people?  Where is TONY BLAIR?  I feel sorry for Russia and Ukrainians.  NATO has poisoned Ukraine along with its leader.  NATO has also slowly creeped up on Russia's back yard.   Lets talk about a Scottish referendum and imagine Scotland winning the vote for independence.   Scotland will be a free country and a former member of the UK.   Despite Scotland being free, they still have responsibilities towards the security of the UK.   Now can you imagine if Scotland were to invite a enemy of the UK to join them and plant dangerous weapons on their soil?   The UK would not stand for it and would invade Scotland if they did not respond positively to the UK's demands.   This was all Putin was asking for.  Move NATO back and respect Russia's security concerns.   NATO, THE UK AND US did not give a damn.   What else is Russia suppose to do, wait until NATO arrives on their breakfast table?  The Ukrainian leader lacks depth and has put his country in a perilous position.   Russia had to act, even though I disagree with war.      NATO knows very much what they are doing and are hiding behind media distortion.  Why can't this world live in peace?  There is more to it, behind this war, and something serious going on, which is way beyond the average public's understanding.   History is also behind it too.  We better watch out and take care that we don't sleep walk ourselves into a nuclear war.
Putin fascistic dog helped by westerners idiots who do help with sanctions.
Why people dont Listen what Putin Talk ...
Where's the un now
If we don't stand up to invaders it breeds a dangerous belief that leads to more war. China will take Taiwan, the USSR will be formed again. Three countries almost destroyed the entire world last time as the west watched doing nothing. We have to push back now and stop that belief system we have to fight back before it snowballs out of control. Enough about allies humanity is our responsibility NATO and the UN were formed to stop this. Telling Putin he can't eat at McDonald's is not going to help, just give the axis more time to build their front. Destroying the invaders will stop the belief system and the 3rd World War from engulfing us all.
My heart goes out to the woman and children 💔 😢
Bro how is USA standing by, Russia wants a war let's give them it . They can't just invade a country because they feel they can. May God be with Ukraine 🙏 my thoughts and prayers are with you people. I hope good prevails in the end.
4chan is full of videos. Hell.
Love You BBC. 🐺 🌙 🌙 🌙
There is power in numbers the people of Ukraine and Russia need to stand up if they don't want this.  God speed 🙏
Preventative measures should have already happened from NATO
So much for Budapest Memorandum by US, UK & Russia giving security assurances to protect Ukraine from aggression and give political independence in exchange for giving up nukes which they did, and that too to RUSSIA! Not much expected from Russia but seems like a betrayal by the US & UK for not keeping their word. A sad situation for the Ukrainians.
He  s a liar nd a bully?nd if this footage is correct ??what does he expect to achieve    a country in ruins nd a world of condemnation?
This is terrible how Putin can say he act in self defense when Ukraine done nothing to them. Pray for Ukraine
All democrats should be forced to. Seeing they voted for the week biden who also at start of his term dropped all sanctions on russia. He just reinstated them.

Well done Liberals, wouldnt have happened under Trump, Ukrainians need to get rid of their Globalist Puppet Leaders and sorry, but not our problem, no more Globalists Wars, follow the Money.
I'm against war but I just have a question why don't Ukraine fire missiles at Russian cities.
The Russian people must stand against Putin for this to end.
Why are they hitting apartment buildings ??
Well boys y’all might as well start speaking Russian.
more propaganda WE NEED TO STAY  OUTTA THIS SHIT.AMERICA LEAVE RUSSIA AND URKAINE ALONE
3rd world war is coming soon.
Thoughts and prayer people we need action!!!
Let them join NATO now.How else are we ever going to stop Putin doing what ever he pleases.Enough is enough.
Prayers for Ukraine🇺🇦
Hypocrite, spineless west created this sad situation in Ukraine. Russia warned us many times, do not come to my doorstep enough is enough! Biden's first step was as a new president attack Russia and since then, he just keep doing it. What we do accepting from Russia? Wait until we entering it's border with NATO troops? Why we creating mess all over the world and then we acting like innocent sheep and pointing to Russia as a bad guy? Russia just defend oneself. If Russia moves their weapons to Cuba we would be happy? Think people before you judge them.
Putin is a s**t stick. Huge Russia can't feel safe from tiny Ukraine? Shut up!
Fuck yeah. Can't wait to see the world burn 😁
Protect your BTC people, start putting them in cold wallets.
Go Russia 🔥 , its time to show west what their place 🇷🇺🤝🇮🇳
Russia 🇷🇺 isn't playing they gona bring back the USSR
Have no fear the US is here
Putin the butcher of Europe. We stand with 🇺🇦 👊
BRAVOO PUTIN
Instead of that man crying for his family, pick up a rifle and fight for it. No reason people from other countries should leave their family’s behind to fight for what you want. Not to mention, subways deadass empty. He’s the only one hanging out down there lol
THIS IS BULLSHIT!! it's like the hulk saying he feels threatened by skeletor from the movie nacho libre
Hopefully Ukraine is soon cleaned up from the nazis !
DeNazzification of Ukraine......that means something.....
people shouldn't fear it's leader, its leader should fear it's people.

Bidens fault !!! That all started when Biden becomes Präsident 🤮
😢😢😢
I wonder what’s nato and US next move
Stay strong Russia. Spare the good Ukrainian people. Dig out the bad apples.
I am from Afghanistan and I exactly know how the Ukrainian civilians feel. I fled my country when Taliban took over and I know how it feels to be in constant fear of losing your or your loved ones life. My heart goes out to Ukrainian people😔.
Poootin 💩is a murder.
“It’s war for Putin and Biden or anyone else but not our nation.”
Why is IT the beginning of the Third World War? But, for example, not the US striking and demolishing Iraq or Syria?
Russia and Ukraine you are our friends & allies we have historical & religious ties with both, please stop, this isn't the solution. Praying for peace from Greece 🇬🇷
India is always with Russia 🇷🇺🇮🇳
Time to play red alert 2
World full of hatred 😟😟 ...I will pray that this war ended now  n live in peace ...God be with you Ukraine ♥️
GOD! PROTECT ALL PEOPLE! LET'S BE PEACE!
God's abundant Protection and His Grace and Mercy upon the innocent civilians and those who defend the honor of Ukraine 🙏
5:25 huh russia should stop celebrating the victory day if they continue to behave like the nazis. Ukraine is not a country for being bullied. support ukraine from China.
https://youtube.com/shorts/eCgMVNeko9g?feature=share🙂👆
Yes we the west let you down.That old fool Biden should haveSlaughtered the Taliban insteadOf letting them take Afghanistan.
🙏🙏🙏
And u are a coward because you didn't fight for Afghanistan
You’re a clown lol the taliban aren’t killing people, they’re allowing people to live in peace. you are a watan forush that’s probably why you left
Ukraine will probably never be the same after this.
 @Albert Valdez  and you are a coward for not being their to fight by his side.
 @Lotta Smoke  did i just read that?
And did you ran from your country if you were not a criminal
Also war started by USA; its the same enemie.
 @Vinicius abc  in afghanistan nobody call themself afghan you know? just taliban call them afghan they named their race on the country and their langauge on their race just look at their government full pashtu caveman
because US freeze account thousands will die because of sanctions
 @Albert Valdez  are you stupid,taliban is aghanistan people not intruder like american and russian...just go to work and pay taxes..
 @Martin Jenkins  Trump negotiated the withdrawal and exact date for that withdrawal from Afghanistan. The date was May 1, 2021. It was a legal agreement by trump that Biden was bound, legally to comply with. You didn’t know that?
 @Lotta Smoke  you need to be done away with
 @Martin Jenkins  Americans tried, Soviets tried, British tried.... And they all failed.Afghanistan, the graveyard of empires.
 @Martin Jenkins  Trump let them down equally buddy.
THENKS
 @Lotta Smoke  <—— Claims to know more about Afghanistan than a real Afghan. 🙄How trumpian.
Ukraine is burning and y’all are fighting over Biden withdrawing from Afghanistan… Kinda pathetic, sad, disappointing. Makes me wanna ditch planet earth
Soviet Union and USA destroyed ur country. Taliban was the last nail in the coffin ⚰
Where the Afghans fled, the Ukrainians will stay and fight.

Better follow RT rather than continue being fooled by BBC
US messed you up much more than the Soviets so chill brah
the taliban have been the afghani government for 30+ years! They invited the u.s. into afghanistan to prove the people they where looking for where never there! I don't think you have ever been in afghanistan! How do you feel about the Obama regimes drone program targeting and murdering entire families at weddings and funerals?
 @l' M  america went and helped the government and trained them for 20 years and they ran, if any of those countries actually wanted Afghanistan they would take it with ease.
 @Lotta Smoke  source of information: Facebook, isn't?
 @Karolis Cibiliovas  No they both equally fucked them up lmao stop pretending humans are kind?
Same person is responsible for both situations , Donald Trump
@UCE0vVJ_qz8iwEGVhOjxdh-A fake puppet govt
 @Albert Valdez  What he choses to do with his life is his decision.
 @Albert Valdez  here we go the hero! Have you fight against who? The fridge door?
You were coward. And you are illiterate and idiot. More people have been killed by 
Wallah i am from Afghanistan... Only govt officials ran away... Bef they were puppet of U.S .... Thy killed non except us troops
US invaded 
 @The Mentalist Zz 
 @Martin Jenkins  how ? Trump made a deal with them. Surprised you're not supporting that
 @Lotta Smoke  let's see you being a successful person under the very peaceful rule of the Taliban.
 @Albert Valdez  you are brave please go to Afghanistan and fight with Taliban
 @The Magnus  well it's not the first time they were invaded by Russia. Also happened in 2014
Putin's a world economic forum member. :D
 @Albert Valdez  Bro are you alright? Why should he fight if he wants a peaceful life? You would never go out and fight.
Back to home imigrants!
if u are afraid that your fellow nation men took back  the control of your country, from foriegn military.then,  you sir are stupid
The afghan military failed Afghanistan.  Not the US not any particular country but itself. 20 yrs of being trained by the best militaries in the world and given weapons and machines to support the fight and they laid down their weapons when the time came to fight. The lives of many nationalities were lost over a 20 yr span protecting the country. How many more lives and years would it have taken? I am deeply sorry that you had to flee your country and all that you've known. I hope the people of Ukraine that stay behind fight for what is theirs . Hopefully NATO will ensure that Ukraine stands a good chance of winning the battle.
 @Paul Schulte  they have no clue. They just listen to RW news and all they say is the withdrawal was Bidens fault. Meanwhile their orange god negotiated with terrorists and not Afghanistan, our ally, for them to take over an allied nation. No wonder Trump and his cronies are supporting Russia. Knocking another Democratic nation off the map.
my buddy lives in afghanistan and he’s also trying to evacuate, his parents were lucky
 @The Mentalist Zz  Taliban are brutal terrorists that treat women like cattle and behead men for not having beards
 @Lotta Smoke  people starving in afgan they are literally selling their daughters to eat something shame on biden and shame on talibanis
https://youtube.com/shorts/qDExzi6lsvg?feature=share🇺🇦😢
Baghairata
 @Martin Jenkins  said the armchair general. Last time I checked Trump started the pullout from Afghanistan and Biden continued it.
Y’all were weak and deserved to be taken over
That’s just fantastic more head scarfs in England! We are a Christian country and always will be. Church of England all the way
 @The Magnus  I feel sad to say this but there might be no Ukraine left when this is all over.
 @Martin Jenkins  yet Americans couldn’t for 20 years. The country chose the taliban because they were sick of the puppet government placed by the US. Of course some will side with that government but look at what happened. Afghanistan was made much worse by the occupation of the US/west and that goes for every other Middle Eastern country.
 @Albert Valdez  Valdez you are the coward.
You run away from ur country bec thats the plan for most of you to chase ur amerucan, britain , canadian etc dream is it? Ukranians are different bec they love they  country. Coward
 @KKmies  it's different when it's invasion from within than from the outside. And they showed Ukrainians leaving too
@Blurredblues  you are a 🤡 🤡
What is wrong with people on these comment sections. If you are a survivor of war any decent person wishes you peace. It's not easy acceive. Know there are more people wishing you sleep well, good health, and that your relatives are safe.
 @Martin Jenkins  whats really going to fry your noodle is .... it was never about helping them ... you along with most other people just accepted the narrative... you'll now fight tooth and nail to uphold that false truth rather than look closer which will mean accepting you've been duped and thereby falsely help  hold up that false truth unbeknown to you and many others ... such is reality they will allays sell it to you as peace and protection for down trodden peoples .. but in reality other agendas are at play and those behind them dont care for you at all ... all biden nato and the west wanted Afghanistan for was to include into their alliance building marching slowly east as we see now toward russia and china being the end goal and one world government the idea NWO  .. which i dont see happening but not before death and destruction visit this planet on a scale bigger than ww1 and ww2 combined ... project for the new American century google it ...its that this and many other things
Usa is ghe real enemie of afghan
You coward ran away from your motherland instead of fighting, you wusss , don’t even talk
You are a coward who fled his country.
I didn’t know that a considerable amount people are in support of the Taliban. I guess I learned something new from this comment section.
 @Vinicius abc  yes, because that’s the truth. They are not nazis lol
 @Martin Jenkins  Our president is a sleepy pig.
 @Kaaya Idris  he ran because of the taliban read the comment bruh
 @Lilly C  who cares about ukraine
 @ZeroResurrected  The whole Taliban thingy is just exaggerated.  When they were in rule, they punished corrupt authorities and police who were preying on people.  The whole so called Democratic govt. After Taliban were more brutal and committed war crimes in villages. Every political leader was corrupt.  Even then, the anti taliban people did not return to aafghanistan to help build. But many even in the new govt. Fled to western countries. And those are the non pashtun people trying to sneak into other countries. If anything,  Taliban are real aafghans/Aryans who are willing to die for their country. What have you done for your country?
 @Paul Schulte  They are Trump supporters, they know nothing like a baby just born from mom's womb
This comment is 100% political one , mentioning Taliban and forget the 20 years of American invading  ..
 @Lotta Smoke   what country are you from
 @Lotta Smoke  Unless your female?
 @The Mentalist Zz  So, people clung to the landing gear of planes trying to escape from them for nothing? You are a liar and a propagandist!
IT IS NOT THE SAME NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES YOU SAY IT..
 @Blurredblues  you are a racist
You know how the ethnic Russians feel too bruh?
 @warren hall  yeah this is an annexation Afghanistan didn't get annexed by another country but I think he means the feeling of war here
 @ZeroResurrected  no, Afghanistan is one poorest country where you will find everyone wanna go to foreign country wether in peace or war. It is cultural because they don't have good chances to travel outside the country try. So those people simu, illiterate and not so 3nlightened people, just went with the chaos to get a free ride out. Not from actual Taliban but for better life.
Lanti tu hamasha Amerca ka ghullam he rehna pasand kara ga
 @Priscilla Jimenez  Taliban mainly operated from Pakistan and a large portion of Taliban fighters were Pakistani Pashtus. And unlike in Afghanistan, those shown leaving are not soldiers and are not deserting the country.
Where are you now, Turkey?
 @carlos van persie  Actually all of you are cowards for even starting fights amongst each other in the first place. Humanity never changes, we will always eat each other. Maybe nuclear winter is the true savior
 @The Mentalist Zz  Why don’t you go and live under those medievalists if you love them so much?
Why didn't you stay, and fight them? I would rather be killed standing on my morals, than run and complain.
Its black history month. It ain't none of our bizness.. 😝😝😝
 @Martin Jenkins  Ukraine will be nuclear ground of NATO if Ukraine join NATOAlso Ukraine is Part of Russia our mother landPutin have good move to Russian and Ukraine people United in one countyKnow the history first before comment hard here
 @KKmies  they still invaded Afghanistan too
 @The Mentalist Zz  You're damn crazy, that lack of morality of yours... Damn man
Afghanistan will be spewing if geriatric Joe steps in 🤦😂As the great Robin Williams acted ......Goooooooood Morning Vietnam 🙏🙌😂🙏🙌😂
 @muhammad abdullah  Afghanistan isn't in control of Afghans you dimwit
Don’t forget the 2002 US invasion….
But why didnt you guys protect your country. Dont tell me you needed the USA to be babysitting you for ever.A man that does not protect their home shouldnt have that tittle.
All these keyboard warriors saying “you’re a coward for not fighting” are the same people that hide away behind their screens because they feel safe, they feel no one is going to harm them. I bet these keyboard warriors have never been in a fist fight lol.
 @Lotta Smoke   they suppressed women rights
 @Lotta Smoke  how much they paying you for writing bullshit that only yourself believe?
I am Iranian, when Iraq attacked Iran, I stayed and defended. People must learn to stay and defence their soils.
 @Albert Valdez  rude
 @Steph Latham with all respect and i am not being raciat but people are fed up by these people who are economic migrants. I myself a immigrant but i have come to uk by legal process bec of my skill and i never had benefits. We must be realistic bec afganistan people habe used the chance to economically migrate to west. While the west have given them goverment , policing and weapons to protect themselves. But they so not love their country and fled instead of fight . They can win especially they have the numbers and technology. But what did they do. Sacrifices by the brave soldiers who died for them was wasted. Now these economic refugees have all benifits. In the uk thia summer they be up in hordes to come in here. I admire ukrainains bec they choose to fight. God bless them
I am an afghan myself and this is a utter nonsense. Afghanistan is far more safer now than it was before.
Coward shia or tajik. The Taliban defended Afghanistan against the American led invasion.
 @Martin Jenkins  Russians invasion of Ukraine is also Biden's fault by your logic.Because the U.S. helped it is blamed of not keeping helping even though it wasn't our responsibility to help in the first place and Afghans are supposed to protect their own country.
I made video about ukraine! :/
The thing is Afghanistan is not a military power and will never be, on the other side, russia is powerfull china is powerfull and they are allied it takes 1 attack on usa and its ww3
 @david brand  you mean Biden don't you .
 @Martin Jenkins  trump started the pull out stupid
The big difference is your people run they will fight
Your 
 @ZeroResurrected  why ad hominem?  I presented you with reality, not my opinion. I have no love or hate here, just genuine analysis which may not cater to feeble minded nor faint hearted.  With that said,  if you are calling taliban medieval out of hate, then you are against 90% of the people there who are also culturally medieval. They may have some 3xtreme mentality, but they are product of their own culture. While you find a minority in Kabul wearing western style dress, most Afghan women themselves don't approve of them. The puppet govt was just centered in Kabul and that's it. The rest were just brutal themselves. Between Taliban and the democratic govt. Lesser of the two evils comes to mind. With that peace !
 @Lotta Smoke  Are you a terrorist supporter? Because I heard Taliban blown Buddhist monuments just because it's not their religion. And now they are ruling a country. They bully women and used them only to breed. May be you are some fanatic who puts religion infront of literally everything.
Cry about it.
 @ايمان  its as if propaganda doesnt exist
 @Ch T  When Iraq is invaded by ISIS, their military personnel run like the cowards they are. There's literally more than 30 000 professional Iraqi soldiers in Finland alone, hiding. Just like the Afghans. No balls at all. Immediately when Westerners left Afghanistan, they folded even though their army outnumbered Taliban 10 to 1.
If we don't stop importing gas from Russia and bring back coal, there is no way we can beat Russia. SWIFT and INSTEX also need to be made unavailable to Russia. We also need to stop exporting semiconductors. It does not appear that NATO has any intention of competing with Russia. I feel sorry for them, but Ukraine has been abandoned.
Then way the fu$$ you left your country...
 @Martin Jenkins  Trump done the deal with the Taliban, Martin
If you are old enough you could have also experienced a Russian invasion
Stay strong man ❤️
 @Martin Jenkins  he should have but it would have been Vietnam all over again because of the terrain and gueeilla warfare
Why did you flee buddy? You should fight and defend your country not flee 👎🏽
 @ZeroResurrected   youre misinturpreting the situation
I doubt you fled when they took over
 @Albert Valdez  How dare you to say that? Would you stay in a country that gets attacked to just get slaughtered?
 @Albert Valdez  your a coward too for not helping then lol
America will kill more inocent afghan people by freezing there 10billion dollars. which is held in central bank reserve. The biggest war  criminal
Your willingly ignorant if you believe that
 @Lotta Smoke  do you even live in Afghanistan or you’re just saying shit
 @Wati25  lmao trained by the best military, dude they didn’t give a toss about training anyone. Just needed a good excuse to fund weapons with tax money and flush it out the system.
I'm glad you made it out ☺️
 @Estufas y Hornos Reynoso  um, a puppet propped government is not thier home...
 @Martin Jenkins  The West created the Taliban, dude.  Look up black funding to Pakistani intelligence services and how that ended up 
 @Mohd Hassan  Wallah they will not listen to you because the media in America has brainwashed them
 @IMPERIA  who suppressed womens rights?  Just 
fascism will be destroyed in Ukraine...AZOV...Bandera....
 @Martin Jenkins  but trump was the one who planned to leave Ukraine. Biden was just following his plans. So are they both cowards?
 @Karolis Cibiliovas  That isn't true.  The Soviet Union started a program of 
Truly it's a heart breaking, we all need to look upon the LORD our maker and return to him for he is the only savior! May the Lord save Ukraine
 @Ambrose Barasa  If that's your plan, Ukraine is screwed.
Bless you ⭐⭐⭐
 @Albert Valdez  jij zal ook rennen,en ik zal het je niet eens kwalijk nemen.Waarschijnlijk ren ik met je mee.Wees blij wij geen flauw idee hebben wat hij mee maakte.Mensen die met grote bekken een oorlog in stappen zijn vaak niet de mensen die het waar maken.
Putin has a great personality which most Muslim leaders don't include Ashraf Ghani
Taliban are rightful heirs of Afghanistan, Putin is not the rightful heir of Ukraine. You don't know how we feel because Putin's never happened to you
 @Martin Jenkins  .. Yeah, because we all know how Don the Con negotiated with the Taliban to let them back in.. What a failed policy that was, huh.. LoL, Republicons negotiating with Terrorists..
 @lwin moe hein  you know who puts religion in front of everything, ecery contry that has ever infiltrated another one, ... the US tried to bring thier 
 @N Amin  WaR CrImInAl!! -stupid humanity
shame on you coward, i know how much lie you have put together just to be accepted by USA
 @fattyjaybird  that's why religion is one big joke. Another reason to divide humanity amongst groups lol
 @Albert Valdez  easy to say
 @Albert Valdez  NO CIVILIANS SHOULD FI GHT THE WA RS OF THEIR GOVERNM ENT OR POLITICIA NS. No one benefits besides the rich men at the top. The propaganda that's funneled into our brain into deceiving us to k i LL other people just because they don't share the same borders or land as us is ludicrous. It's all to do with greed and money.
Yeah baby..what was the dirty greedy Usa  (i mean the soldiers) doing there, then??? Help the oppressed as usual??? As long as you can’t speak about the greedy governments who were occupying Afghanistan for Years for its Resources…nothing left there except the poor people who lives there…
Where was your 💓 during Donbass suffering
Well here is again America and Russia behind the unrest in Ukarain just like they were responsible for the on going war in Afghanistan
 @Albert Valdez  you know how long Afghanistan been in war? He might’ve been a child when he fled
Only when the Taliban took over not the decade long bombing by the West?You're either seriously deluded or a bot.
 @Shagufta Naz  why not shame on America and russia who started all this 50 years ago . Taliban are bad but they are afghan people not foreigners
 @TeddyAnarchist  that's your opinion and that's fine. The fact is the arms and vehicles came from multiple source countries and much of it was used.
 @Trashboªt  i dont think you understand... its not 
 @Trashboªt  humanity by nature is divided
Comes from a person who collaborated with the occupation forces ,killed thousand of people and now fled the country like a rat to save his ass
 @Albert Valdez  I guarantee you would run as soon as you heard you're country was getting attacked
 @Paul Schulte  your so full of shit! Biden could have done plenty . He chose not too.and even if he couldn't change the date.  Then  you start the pullout sooner . And you take all of the military equipment out you don't leave it for the enemy.  So just stop with your bullshit
 @Hshshs Bdjeje  Absolutely nonsense, the terrain of Afghanistan is absolutely daunting, and their fighting style is unorthodox.USSR, American, and Britain tried their utmost to win, but they lost.Even Alexander the great lost in Afghanistan.
 @fattyjaybird  and with that it will also be the end of us. Poor earth is suffering enough for 
Just for everyone who thinks I am a coward for leaving my country: Just think about what you’re saying for a second. I lived in my country in the same home and in the same city my whole life. I lost relatives, people who I really loved because of this war that was being forced on us. I as a child witnessed some horrendous actions that i still have PTSD from. I don’t want to fight a war that I know for a fact that neither of the sides really care about my opinions or what I stand for. I don’t support Taliban and I didn’t support the previous Afghan government either. My family members who are still in Afg are struggling to find literally anything to eat. I work here and send them money. I am not afraid of Taliban but i am scared of being so desperate that I have to beg for a loaf of bread.
 @Wati25  there’s literally video of Afghan soldiers doing military operations with us soldiers and the afghans are high off their faces. What they did was criminal negligence at the least. They essentially gave all those weapons to terrorists. Wouldn’t be the first time now would it ?
 @Sulaiman siddiqui  I don’t invalidate your feelings. You are right to feel this way but you have to remember that the other side is willing to die for their cause and unless you are willing to do the same, you will always be defeated. There is no justice or mercy in the real world. You are forced as a man to sacrifice your life just like all those before you. We all die in the end anyway.
 @ZeroResurrected  stop believing your fake news BS - have you actually been to Afghanistan or even seen or spoke to a  taliban soldier👋🏼😆
 @Albert Valdez  ok keyboard warrior. Its easy to type from their Moms basement. 🤣
Afghanistan fought a battle with Russia and won so be proud for what your country achieved ,but with the Taliban that's another story
 @Albert Valdez  and your not in his shoes to be shouting coward , as that country fought the Russians and won
How many of your countrymen died by the 20 years of constant NATO bombardement? 100.000? 250.000?
 @Paul Scott  the taliban are the people of Afghanistan
 @Albert Valdez  stap it 🤡
Thank God you are safe. Nothing matters except your safety and welfare. Don't take ppl bulshit telling you should stay in your country. They dont know shit you were going through. These ppl are clowns. Keep a head for your life. 😊
Biden and Nato pinned it exactly as to how it would play out. They were right on target.
Now time to stop Russia's invasion against Ukraine anyway otherwise it will create inspiration to take control territory of other countries like China can take control of Taiwan and some part of India. North Korea can try to start war against South Korea. Israel can take control full Palestine, Mayanmar can start genocide again it's ethnic communities etc. War can't be a solution it only can destroy. So please stop war against humanity.
So many lives lost and destroyed for the selfish demands of one disgusting individual.
Please don’t put the blame on the Russians, the Civilians have no say! I’m so sorry to all the families, ethnicities and different cultures affected and killed by this ongoing war! I’m so so sorry! God be with everyone
west has been funding neo nazis in ukraine no mention of it by bbc news lol
This horrible to a horrible person! He is a Demon! Putin is Demon
Russian passers-by started talking in English, funny! 90% of Russians do not know your African-American language. We are Russians for the liberation of Ukraine from America!
It’s amazing how the news gets video of this going on. Plus sees everything else that’s going on. It’s like they knew what’s going on
I should imagine the leader of Western Ukraine is every bit as bad as the other disgusting 
WE HAVE TO HELP OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN UKRAINE. We cannot allow Russia to advance further and occupy Ukraine. They are our Allies, we cannot stop at sending munitions and supplies. We must treat this as a threat to the entire free world just as the nazis were. We have to send troops and eliminate this threat.
I think its fair to say its time to Nuke the fuuu out of russia
Ну а вы хули хотели, президент Украины - актер (комик). Вот и довел Путина
Turns out appeasing policy fails.
the real british people are backing PUTIN, the bbc media and scared british politicians and their brainwashed lefty snowflake followers only make up for 20% of this country, the other 80% is the real working class public who built this country have been silenced
Why does civilians have to pay ?
This so fucked up, why are they doing this, Putin must be punished
Why the fuck are they running ads on this? They are literally profiting off war
sorry for Ukrainian people. the russian people support you and hate Putin
Putin is a dirty little hitler
This Act of war by Russia will be like an encouragement for other countries to declare the same against there enemy
I live in Ukraine should I join the Ukrainian army to defend my country?
Guess who helped get ukrian to give up there nukes in the 90s. Bill Clinton . Democrats are partly responsible for this.
Cause and effects.  Thanks to the western media, BBC…
Why would anyone kill innocent people? We human beings call ourselves the most wise creatures, but is it really? It may be true but I think with selfishness and  heartless actions we are also the most stupid and ignorant creatures! The rich should respect the poor. we have to be know that life is lost once but properties and other physical things are regained and regained.   My prayers goes to Ukrainians.  Peace Peace Peace please.
Killing civilians for an old man's vanity
No different than Ireland,England .  2 sides to every story only problem we only see one side . My opinion…
Biden used a hard line against Russia.  What is Biden doing now?  Where are the planes and tanks from the WEST?
Shame devil Putin shame on you and your family
To war we do not want but it is for what he deserves. He may think he has all the cards until he realises he's surrounded
this is all NATO & UK & US & EU's fault  THEY made Ukraine go to war!  so why for example Nato didnt stop TUEKY INVADING NORTH CYPRUS OR NORTH SYRIA OR NORTH IRAQ (Kurdistan) and others?!!  so see they only want their benefits and Russia despite i dislike them but they're obstacle to US & UK & NATO & EU benefits!! its not about human rights at all!!
Neo Hitler
BBC PROPAGANDA 🤮
“Russia cannot feel safe”
Those evil sick world leaders. Scumbags. All of them. Fighting like children as innocent people suffer and others fight their wars for them. Sick sick world. God please rid earth of this evil corruption.
WTF IS GOING ON WITH RUSSIA SO BASICALLY THEY WANT TO TAKE OUT THERE ARMY AND TAKEOVER UKRAINE
This is totally fucked.  Why do Russians support this????
I hope he gets what's coming to him
Thats why U.S did to Iraq,Afganistan,Siria,Vietnam and any other country in the past.
Almost no russiana support this, protests are already going in a lot of Russian cities
They're being brainwashed to believe that Russian citizens were killed in Donnezk and Luhansk, the two States recognized as independend by Russia 2 days ago.Already before 2014 the Russians were told that Ukraine is an aggressive Nazi regime that would threaten their existence.
Stay strong and safe Ukraine...
Russia has no good excuse for this, but this is what happens when NATO squeezes too hard. Biden didn't want too negotiate.
Why this is happening 😭💔the Bible prophecy is happening 🙏I feel really sad
My heart is Breaking for this! Putin Killed Ukrainian! He is a killer he must punished
world should not show any sympathy for the Ukrainian as the world did not show any human gesture for the Afghan common people during Taliban's invasion. Otherwise it will become an example of Racism.
Still doesn't mean we need to send our young people to die for Ukraine. How about we protect our border ?
Putin could go to Argentina for the nazis
A bl@ck dude in kiev.
NATO pushed you into the fire.... Should have ran them off when they were snatching your resources.. This is both the Wests fault and Russias.
Russia want to bring democracy 👍
Let's go Russia
This only opens the door for an invasion into Tiawan and China will be thinking about it or they have been planning for 2 attacks.
Well, the west can confidently say it’s bad to invade other innocent countries on a pretext and they never do it, oh…wait…
Thoughts are with Ukrainians on this sad day
WTF Europe waiting to help Ukranians before it is too late, help them how ever you can. I thought Eu learned its lesson of what should be done against lunatic dictators with Hitler, but it seams they didn't. You can't talk it out with bullies.
Putin admits in his speech https://youtu.be/D95LqdndUM8 that he stands no chance vs the Americans and Nato but his Nuclear ☢️ ICBMS are equal what a fricken Nutjob,This is how  Hitler talked! Putin would end the world over his ego, Ukraine couldn’t be admitted into NATO first off because of Crimea. Secondly all Putin did is wake up Nato and now they will focus on there Milatary. And they will be at cold war levels and beyond in the future. And now Finland says screw Putin we want in NATO and Sweden is thinking about it aswell.
BBC.. If you n believe  this British bullshit c&£t, then  the problem lies with you
Y does Putin launch an attack?? No sense at all, Russia! The world now knows what future Russia holds, in the hands of a such no brainer. Such an uncivilised way of thinking u got there Putin.. Russia will goes into destruction .xx.❤️ & 🙏 goes out to Ukraine and all those around the world.#PrayforUkraine #PrayforMyanmar#PrayforSyria#PrayforAfghanistan#PrayforPalestin#PrayforIsrael#PrayforthosethatsinNEED
Yeah it is, sad for the people
Goodluck from the Netherlands to the Ukraine 🇳🇱❤️🇺🇦
declare war on Russia and be done.   fk Putin.
Poor people, who has to run away without energy #prayforukraine
So where’s the Ukrainian army then??? No one seems to be blocking the entree points 😂🤦🏻‍♂️. More like Ukraine has already surrendered
Self-defence? lol
It has begun..the beginning of the end!
When the US is weak, the world is in chaos.
This is just sad to see. A quite peaceful country destroyed.
🇷🇺🇷🇸
Hitler was not aware of the damage he did to Londen neither, that was till the British targeted Berlin too. If I was Ukraine I would surely try to hit Moscow and destroy the Douma as a payback. I would drop every Ukrainian soldier inside Russia to fight the agressors instead of trying to defend Kyiv. Make the Battlefield unpredictable for Russia. Dont be were Russia want you to be, be were they dont want you to.
Save our Life, then rule over
I really feel bad for all the innocent souls of Ukraine but in the same time i am ashamed to be a part of the people who are hypocrites! Didn't see them reacting against US and their allies when they invaded Iraq with false excuses of having mass destruction and cry for the innocent children, woman who die in palatine and other such countries invaded by US!  SHAME ON YOU!!!!
Democratic world in Ukraine?  I think inside zelisnki is laughing 👍Corruption level in ukraine government is beyond logical thinking, only war can clean all bandits from there 👍
Prayers for Ukrain 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 my heart breaks for Ukraine...Please father  GOD touch the heart of President   VLADIMIR PUTIN to STOP the WAR🙏🙏🙏 Please have mercy to all people in UKRAINE...PEASE STOP THE WAR..........😭😭😭😭😭😭😭☹😭😭😭😭😭
russia is being pushed to take such a call, what would usa do if a misslie is put in their backyard by russia or china.

Just accept Russian conditions. Easy solution.
Let’s not forget Yemen 🇾🇪 Libya 🇱🇾 Syria 🇸🇾 Palestine 🇵🇸
Stay strong Ukraine
Everyone whom cannot stay and fight you're welcome to my city in Kosovo till all  this is over. Don't hesitate to write me here .
Let's not forget Israel 🇮🇱🇮🇱🇮🇱
What EU and USA gonna do is sanction more on Russia. But leaders of EU and USA do not know, sanction is a joke nowadays. Who cares about sleepy Biden's sanction. Days are coming when China and India will impose sanction to USA and EU.
I need Ukraine should be excavated completely than nuked so putin can't have it
The start of WW3 my friends
Why is Putin doing this? It does not help anyone.
ukraine paying for US' greed.
Russia 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼😤😤😤
What would the USA do if Russia made an alliance with Mexico and set up rockets on the border with the USA ??? That is exactly what is happening to Russia right now. That is why Putin is absolutely right. America sent its army far beyond its borders, across the ocean, because they thought their national security was threatened, imagine if that threat was 100 miles to a larger American city, how would they behave? I think it is much more aggressive than Russia is doing now.
To hunt, search, corner and assassinate the Russian tyrant and destroy Moscow and Minsk without mercy now
So sad 😞 Justice and Peace ✌️
PUTIN iS THE GOD OF THIS WORLD🙏. PRAISE PUTIN THE ONE & ONLY GOD.🙏
The Russians invading! If so many Ukrainians don't want this, why are they leaving?
Not his country at all Ukraine should have a Ukrainian president
The want the fascist.. not the Ukrainian people.. and there are mamy nazi / fascist with weapons and Europe even gives them more..  don’t forget the past..   check it out .. it’s all available in the internet
War does not determine who is right,only who is left-Bertrand RussellPrayers for the innocent 🙏🏻
Ukraine will surrender
8:10There.That's itIt's the politicians who want wars.Not the people
Sameful Russia bad mentality president.actually horrible.
Just report the news correctly . . . 
Sameful Russia bad mentality president.actually horrible.
What a shame for Russia to attack such a small country........Putin is evil minded....
Russia is in the right on this one.
Ask NATO that invades other countries like iraq. Then teach Russia 🇷🇺. Lol
 @Evry none  ur mom is the right one
 @The Sniper  wasn't that just the us u idot
 @Evry none  Russia is the new third reich
 @Switch Statement  how so? By invading your neigbour because it is growing closer to your biggest enemy? Third Reich is a different case. It cared about the wellbeing of its people and wanted lands back in the east.
I thought it was center
 @Evry none  Ukraine is not your slave, they are as free as any country.Adolfimir Putler's madness will lead to russian people's starvation in any case, and potentially even a world war.
Morality determines who is in the right.
 @Evry none  Hitler used the same rhetoric that Putin is using now. His way led to the death of 60,000,000 humans. Putin thanks you for your support.
 @Paul Schulte  Hitler is another subject in it's own respect. Putin here is doing something against NATO, which is a good thing.
 @Evry none  Putin thanks you for your support
 @Evry none  
 @The Sniper  - and mention Libya and Yugoslavia as well - bloody hypocrites
Exactly, doesnt matter if the dead were in the right, and they usually were.
 @my Plan  it's a just invasion. If NATO can mess up libya because they tried to weaken french control on Afrikan countries then russia can invade Ukraine
​ @Evry none  Out of curiosity, which side is and has been preparing for a defensive and which – for an ofensive war? Which side has had 100k military on their borders for months and which is now scrambling to enforce them? Both sides may be led by an ape with the nuclear option, but only one is threatening to exercise it. Both sides have their favorites, but one has been trying to hide their involvement, poorly at that. While one side can be argued to be moving things to early industrialisation age, the other is certainly pushing back to exactly 1914.Why would a 
 @The Sniper  Maybe you forgot that Iraq had invaded Kuwait?No you didn’t. Your rooting for Putin.
Well actually that’s not true…someone had to stop the nazis. Stupid quote.

Ukraine has every right to be free .This is a atrocity , against humanity a crime nothing else .It’s one man with great hatred you can hear it in his tone
It's crazy that's so much of the world is affected by the decisions of so few people. Less than 0.001% of the world's population decides how life goes for the rest of us. Thats just insane to me.
Take out the convoys, arm POVs

how can you use U.S. as a peacemaker shame  Europeans fix this find peace
LOL this is why people hate and have no trust in American Media you can't make this s*** up and their eyes America allies and animerica can-do-no-wrong I noticed they never tell what America do lol they never tell the BS that America support only dictators is here in America mass incarceration Champs in corrupt police  and besides the American Caucasian have never ever and will never take home a power like Russian because then they would have to fight man the man they could use air supremacy and you know the American Caucasian do not like a man a man fight that's why I support Russia as a so-called American I know at least three to four hundred thousand so-called black Americans that will support Russia

Sad day for humanity .. in recent years …🙏love from India. We have to fight against powerful evil .. we have only one earth
вот и дождались украинцы  Российских  солдат, все 8 лет говорили воюем с России, теперь реально воюйте, что то не видно вас.
Sameful Russia bad mentality president.actually horrible.
Europe let NATO get weak, and Germany trusted Putin.  How's that working now?
Putin why, this is not what humans want :(
Sameful Russia bad mentality president.actually horrible.
Mark can’t fight the damn dog scared him chill bro and go west 😂🤣😂
Russia=Rogue state
Those who instigated Ukraine are pretending to be very innocent. They boosted up Ukraine to become a member of NATO AND BECOME A THREAT TO RUSSIA. The USA/NATO/Europe are the cause of this war and not Russia. Russia has retaliated. Ukraine is to be blamed for all the problems. They listened to the USA/NATO/Europe and now they have asked for trouble and also got it. We feel sorry for Ukraine, but it is too late. They had eight years to settle this issue. Had they said NO to NATO membership. Nothing would have happened. But they wanted NATO membership even if it meant a war. That is exactly what Russia said and did. They invaded Ukraine before it could become a NATO member and place NATO nuclear missiles in Ukraine. Till the last moment President Putin waited for a positive answer. Zelensky should have said no and there would be no war. But he was very insistent for NATO membership. The terrible tragedy is that many European countries DO NOT WANT Ukraine to be become a member of Europe or NATO. Ukrainians do not know this. That is why NATO has delayed membership for Ukraine for more than eight years. This is too long and too bad. NATO cheated Ukraine and fooled them.We feel very sad for Ukraine and the people of Ukraine. May God help Ukraine.
Sameful Russia bad mentality president.actually horrible.
And like sheep we still vote for them...or worship them
Humans are hypocrites lmao please go look in the mirror and wonder why we even have to fight amongst each other for our useless governments. There's no good side, just destruction of earth
No American said that other than muslims 🤣🤣🤣
So Russia is invading and bombing inoccent people and we are here just watching it like come on let's start bombing Russia to see how they like it
Watch China invade Taiwan now in the coming weeks
Putin is like xi,his popularity will go 👎.both are a threat to world peace.
My heart is aching. Praying for all Ukranians. Please stop this war. Have mercy please.
Horrible sight, Heart goes out to all people in Ukraine, but also the people in Russia that does not stand with Putin.
Sameful Russia bad mentality president.actually horrible.
If you’re 70 years old you shouldn’t be allowed to govern a country. If you aren’t going to be alive to see the consequences of your leadership in the next 10-15 years
every one is looking new to war why we have seen war in middle east but no one act like this the only new thig here is RUSSIA defending it self.
Omg when people will stop
Ukraine should never played games against Russia! Nato used them to threaten Russia! Ukraine Believed Europeans and Americans lies that they will protect them and russia won’t do nothing! But they got fucked now and no one coming to rescue them !America will do the same if Russia planned to install missiles in Mexico or canada !
Goodness help us all 🙏🏽❤️
UKRAINA STAY STRONG!!!❤
I don’t remember seeing Ukrainian forces assist NATO in Afghanistan. 🧐  Now they are asking for milk when they didn’t help milk the cow. I wish them the best of luck. At least they are willing to fight for their country.
Praying for the people of Ukraine 🇺🇦 from South Korea.
This is absolutely terrible. I swear at this rate President Putin is currently the most feared President. What a dangerous human being. I never thought I'd see this day in my lifetime! Prayers up for Ukraine.
If NATO isn't able to defend Ukraine now, or doesn't want to, what is the point of offering Ukraine membership?  Isn't that what caused Russia to attack?
Putin is gona swallow Ukraine with ease for playing around to bad what politics and western countires do to people that just wana live in peace!!
Sad days here on this planet people. Nothing will ever be the same after this. Innocent people die for what?? What would we do if Russia came to US how would we deal with it? I think everyone knows what would happen we will not just stand around and watch as things like this happens. Outcome is not gonna be good for Russia bad move on their part.
True colour of Russian federation
Russia will pay for this there leader is a fool
https://youtube.com/shorts/qDExzi6lsvg?feature=share🇺🇦😢
Damn that evil man. The world has known for some time just how bad Putin is and the oligarchs behind him. These people have raped the Russian people for the last twenty years, and what we see today is his attempt to spread his dictatorship over all of Europe.
Ukrainians need to stand their ground and not flee. the government is giving anyone and everyone a weapon if they want to help defend their country. Stand up and fight. My heart goes out to everyone in Ukraine 🇺🇦 🤝 🇺🇸
What a horrible day in human history... So many lives in danger.
This is what happens when you push massive sanctions against a country. Also happened against Japan before WWII.
Good propaganda.
The BBC is such a joke.
Madman Putin. Smart but mad..liar Putin.
Why is this behavior necessary? History has proven that No one ever wins.
The world is run by lunatics.
Let’s go RUSSIA 🇷🇺
Come russia ..move on ..🔥🔥🔥 usa,nato,un all mfks was doing blw jb with Israel while israrel was invading Palenstine and now the usa,nato,un is moaning like a ditch for a russia ..and also Ukraine supported israrel to invade Palenstine ... And also so called nato is surrounded russia that's why russia is taking good step .. and daring step 🔥🔥
Venezuela 🇻🇪 is on our flank 👀 let’s keep our head on a swivel
Stop the war.. 
ww3 is happening?!
Pray for the world, they want to destroy the old world for NWO
Out of the last 4 presidents, Trump was the only one that Russia didn't seize any territory under. Liberals and legacy media (yes you too BBC) would have you believe Trump would let Russia do whatever they wanted when the exact opposite was true. You people who voted in Biden and media who shilled for him, all of these people's deaths are on your hands. Live with that for the rest of your miserable lives.
the western country's wanted this to happen
Support Ukraine. This is no longer just a Putin war. The Russian people need to be held responsible as well until he is removed and Russia changes its way.
Where is nato/un now? Are we counting deaths before we act? This is inhumane. Injustice, animalistic, barbaric, never give power to people who do not respect the value of life, never give power to people who have hatred in their hearts and easily drowned by power they hold.
usa at nato saan na ? ano puro lang pala salita help nyo na
Are you talking about the sanctions imposed after Russia did the exact same thing to Ukraine in 2014?
America is just a salesman of war machine in every war. No need to call themselves as a world leader.
Putin is wickedness personified
Pray for Ukraine , many innocent people will be die  this war... please stop war against boundaries🙏🙏🙏🙏
BLM stole election from TrumpBLM destroyed the USA militaryBLM is the cause for this invasion
This is Russian way of security assurances against threats or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. Given in Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances 1995
Protests end like that in Canada too. Saw this war coming ever since the Obama administration formulated the violent coup that overthrew the previous government. I doubt this will be included in the timeline though … since the real enemy is that snarling Russian leader. Lol.
https://youtu.be/8X7Ng75e5gQ
ITS A MILITARY AIRPORT BBC leaving that vital bit of information out to provoke fear in you.
Humanity suffers the most because of a few dumb people who are given innemerable power in their hands...God bless those innocent souls who lost their lives
So much more going on than what's being broadcast...
What is a Crime of Ukarien and Ukarien threatening to Russian. Can't believe it innocent and people have to die.  Requesting all country in the world come together And defeat this EVILS person Putin.  Let's peace previal in the name of Jesus christ and mother Mary amen
Watch the Ukrainian comedian president flee like the last one in 2014, lol
World War 3 has started. Remember this day.

BBC YAPPING ALOAD OF RUBBISH YET AGAIN, ALL LIES BBC LIES. you have shamed britian
So killing civilians is considered now as self defence. Lost my respect to this stupid idiot.....
This is a dang on shame..

My spirit weeps to witness all your suffering now😢My prayer goes to the people of Ukraine🙏

Nato has no balls, simply barking and watching this stupid dictator putin playing fool with lives of people. I hope his life will end in the same way as that of gaddafi
The poorest country of Europe fighting against the biggest country in the world. Putin is a murderer and a criminal. Muy heart with ukrainians
А где информация? Только кажется или думается? Факты где?
Another lie of the Western media. Show the other side of the conflict! Russia supports and loves President Putin. Where were you when the Ukrainian Nazis killed the children of Donbass for 8 years? Why are you silent about the genocide of Russians in eastern Ukraine?
7:50 And why don't they ( the Russian People ) support this...?   Stupid Question...  Who is looking to support the DEATH of Innocent lives OVER GREED... ALL WARS ARE CREATED OVER GREED. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand, when a country wants to take over another country it ALWAYS points to GREED. And unfortunately it's NOT the common folks that start these wars... It's people in Power that start these wars and the common folks that are left behind are just there to pick up the pieces....  God Protect the Meek, Innocent, Compassionate, Loving people of Both Countries... Because Both Countries are going to have casualties...🙏🙏🙏😔😪💚💜
@5:23 That's ironic because many of Ukrain's army members are a card carrying Nazis
Genesis 15:13-14 APTTMH ⭐ MTKRF ♾️
I guess Crimea was a test. Nothing happened, so now Ukraine. Where next? Also, what about Taiwan, I'm sure tension will rise there simultaneously out of the distinctive opportunity.
That jets are Sukhois, only one have enough power destruction to wipe out a city, they have no chance in this war
Well if most Russians don’t want this shit then they better get the fuck off their lazy asses and fkn protest wtf are u kidding me
Very sad but anyone with sense can see that Russia was forced to do this. The West should never have actively backed the coup and allowed it's aftermath.Anyone can see Putin is a man of peace and reluctantly gave the orders. The USA would have done the same had the situation been reversed. Let's say with Hawai or Puerto Rico in place of Ukraine. Much weaker examples but..
i don't think NATO will go to Ukrain, if the Russians come into Romania or other NATO country they will be forced to actunless they fuck us over like Churchill did and use us for negotiations
Putin has always been a sick man. This will be the Third World War. Be prepared.
Freedom and peaceful for the people's Ukraine 🇺🇦
Russia is a regime…. God bless Russian citizens, who are so brave to express their revolt, not their fault that a greedy old shit want to take everything which is not NATO territory!
The hitler soul
Protests are already going in a lot of Russian cities
Exactly
As a serbianI think civilians shouldnt suffer for politicians
F#ck Pootin!
受战争伤害最深的永远都是平民，愿大家能够安好
Russia Does Saamm and Israel Saamm no difference no fear untouchable
Time now for the Russian people to do the right thing.
I could cry hearing average businessmen say they’ll drop everything to serve on the front line. 🥺
Putin is the Nazi.
where the hell is the Ukrainian army. I don't see them anywhere. Where is the border protection? like you guys gonna let them just walk in ??
Sorry to say this, but this is ALLLLL the U.S. Medias fault! They needed talking points? Now they have em while people perish. I hate my countrys media bullies!
Why in this day and age do innocent people, families, children have to lose their lives because of political issues. It’s just so wrong. The rest of the world is on your side Ukraine. Stay strong.
It’s a sad day for Ukraine and the rest of the world as we sit by Europe sits by and watches this country and all of its civilians get wiped out shame on NATO for doing nothing because they don’t want to get involved unless something or some damage is inflicted on them such an embarrassment to live on this planet sometimes it’s just not worth bringing a child into the world knowing that there future will be dependent on government and their shitty decisions
My heart goes out for Ukraine. Unfortunately, it's Biblical. Russia will conquer Ukraine because of your (Ukraine) waters in order to continue conquering the north. America, braise yourselves -  you have forgotten God in the name of peoples 
Just gonna leave this here and ask who will answer for all of this ?1950-1953 Korean War1960-1975 Vietnam War1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion1983 Grenada1989 Invasion of Panama1990-1991 Perisan Gulf War1995-1996 Interventions in BiH1999 Kosovo War2001-???

Of course Russia still sucks as a country. We should’ve never helped supply them in ww2. Should’ve Let Germany and Russia destroy themselves and then had the rest of the allies conquer both Germany and Russia
We don't need a World war 3 after a pandemic, God have mercy on us🙏
You are a foreign state broadcasting within the united kingdom. Payment for using the united kingdoms airways is a long time over due! Bunch of criminals and psychotic liars! The people of east ukraine have been persecuted for near a decade since the unelected gang you support murdered protestors, burned police officers and publicly executed elected representatives of the ukranian people backed by the wests fiscal cartel.You refused to give venezuela their gold, and let the oil barons devastate the largest exporter of oil's economy! You want russia to stop exporting oil so you have a monopoly over a commodity that has higher supply then demand!You are terrorists!
Denazify????   Listen, Vlad, the Great Patriotic War ended on May 9, 1945.  Last century.  Grow up

You know how it goes small ego man commanding large armies not giving a fukc about common folks
Honestly it's just so sad, we will destroy the world that we live in slowly..
Because Russians had no spine to protest or take down Putin from power.
 @Pluviophile  people won’t risk their livelihoods to protest
 @Pluviophile  Uh do you know what happens to people who do?
It's more than political, it's an attempt to conquer valuable land
Except for China😭
I hope you're right that 
speak for yourself. those who truly understand the genocide committed by the Ukrainian government fully support the actions of Russia. We will always weep for the innocent lives lost in any war. But where are the tears for the thousands of Eastern Ukrainian women and children slaughtered by the Ukrainian government.
 @daft nord  is Ukraine on oil?
 @daft nord  Not exactly of conquer. If Ukraine joins NATO, the US will set up a Military Base and further a threat to Russia. They did warn many times, a couple of months now. But Ukraine just continued with that approach of joining. Now there is no turning back, this can turn ugly as Putin did hint at a nuclear war.
It's not bc of 
 @S AV  Everyobe knows they weren't getting let into NATO, but that should have been expressed. Kept letting flirtatious of it and that gave Putin some pretext.
 @Riley Wilson  in Russia what do they do to protesters?
 @Mike MikeN  Also, the EU, US and UK were locking them with Sanctions. This is a country with over 18,000 nuclear warheads. Let's just hope they don't shoot that towards the EU or the UK.
The rest of the world is here commenting
Ppl in power make money off war at the expense of the ppl.  To me it means a new era is on the horizon something has to end for something else to begin.   And hopefully its not going to be some sinister plan.
What is 
Ukraine needs help and sadly prayers and thoughts don’t matter in this day and agr
At this ”day and age” Yemen have been blown to nothingness by US and Saudi. children starved, blown to bits, a whole independent country raped and turned to dust and you said what?!…”Just another day for you and me in paradise”
I honestly don't think it's just political issues pushing Putin and Russia to do this . There's always more to it than political issues..... As push the levy goes.
 @Seth Riggio  The UN estimates 14,200-14,400 people were killed in eastern Ukraine between 14 April 2014, when the conflict started, and 21 February 2022, including:rrat least 3,407 civiliansr4,400 Ukrainian forces personnelr6,500 members of armed groupsgenocide? you dumb?
If you have anyone is Ukraine get into contact with me and we can evacuate them to poland
It's not a political issue. Russian agitators in the east of the Ukraine started this. If they didn't like the Ukraine, why didn't they just go back to Russia?
 @S AV  no way nukes are getting launched. You think russia is the only country with a stockpile not even Putin is that stupid
 @Kurt M.  I think because Russias real agenda is disguised by those personality types trained to do that learned behaviors . It's senseless and rude to kill just as it is selfish to stand in the way  of another's primal survival as the empowered they want to reject  .  I also think it's more of a matter of earth and Russia becoming more uninhabitable a bit more unbearable since nuclear manufacturing and disaster escalated with new viruses too.  The expense of sickening treatment and no one going along with his agenda to help him and his UFO budget because we go through similarities and emergency somewhat the same things only differently.. It's deep . Let's hope our men and people escape death, hell aka war and the grave for a time . I have to to tell ya this magnetic shift they are wanting to survive it. It has alot of push ,power to make them take it out on the Ukraine. To Putin what's Wasting Kremlin lives .
Is Pluto for real! What possible threat could Ukraine be to Russia? I know one thing the president of the United States Joe Biden the man I voted for better act decisively and I'm not talkin with sanctions! I want him to put an aircraft carrier right into that mix of that. Those people did nothing to provoke this! That Russians czar wants to fight the European Union and the United States is ready to meet him at the door.
Be strong Ukraine💪💪💪💪💪💪I pray for you 🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲🤲
Don't lay down your guns freedom or die.
W.O.K.E.R.Y.
I’m Russian and I hate Putin 🤡👈
Neither the USA nor NATO will help, they provoked it and now it's out of the way.
Russia: 
So the baltic bully has attacked the Ukraine hiding behind his nuclear armament. My thoughts and prayers go to all in Ukraine and especially my dear friend Luda whose family are there. Can the West now just sit back and let the Ukrainians face their new Chernobyl? Putin has let down Russians, Ukrainians and all those throughout the world who still strive for peace.
im here for Russia...... let's go... it's a war against former faschists and muricas sucking balls doll and NATO's... just destroy the whole military stronghold... nothing else. Greetings from Serbia.... and take care .I. and you england I forgot.... imperialists shit.. your end is near, believe me
We did it joe
The only war similar to this is Korean war. USA did horrible thing to dividing the country based on the separatist capitalist. Russia is doing same to Ukraine using separatist communists. If Korea was justified so is this
If damage by a small accident nothing loss, if damage by storm  something loss but if damage in war everything is loss. They have  no idea Where is their way. Digesting these situation  is so hard.We all pray God for  as possible  as early solve the problem  and  get back  in their own lives .
Pe gyi Putin de dil ch thandak.
Clearly  Putin is the aggressor....so sad people at large  are the sufferer!!!
Ironic how putin talks about de-nazifying Ukraine when both the prime minister and president of Ukraine are Jewish
How many Africans do you Brits still continue to slaughter ,to allow you to loot them of their natural resources.BBC ,is just a flaming turd of a mouth piece for imperialist just like CNN
Lets wipe out china usa snd Russia and live in peace
Crazy basterds.
Ukraine would go to civil war anyway... so i guess beeing invaded and transformed in a puppet its just another alternative to a long lasting war.

I think this pretty much safe to say almost every country has conducted these operations regardless of what side you're on.
 @William Renwei  sad but true...
Hope we would not do devastation like western peace and democracy-keeping operations caused millions of human lives in Afgan, Syria, Iraq, and Libya. Finally no chemical weapons...bombed all the buildings and bridges in the whole country. Those were the real fake humanitarian operations in recent history. When Russia does the same it is called INVASION... :))
america want to instill democracy bombs iraq afghanistan syria libya syria so on and so forth...there are no good sides here ..just your false belief that there is which is caused by ....propaganda which also is on both sides everywhere ... always notice how people either on one side or the other ? ..the trick is to not be pulled to one side or other for there are no good or bad sides ..there's just peoples beliefs mostly manufactured for them with out realizing it by media propaganda
 @Anton Fernando  It's an 'INVASION' because that's what it is. There is no other way to put it, Russia are doing this to expand their territory. More whataboutism...

Totally unbelievable, it’s a shame, we are still fighting Covid and now these poor ppl have to worry about losing everything. May god Bless the people of Ukraine 🇺🇦 ❤️🙏🙏🙏
Now you know what Iraqis and Afghans went through.
Congratulations to a brutal Russian, weak grovelling western leaders, western and Russian media, and the military-industrial complex. This would have never happened if Orange Man Bad with the mean tweets was still in the White House.
Putting is new Gitler. Way smarter tho
So Russia manufactured pretexts to invade another nation, decapitate it's government and set up a puppet regime loyal to itself. How is that different from what we did in Iraq and Afghanistan? 🤔

Not a good place for a reporter when Putin shows up
where was the world media when Palestine, Syria, Libya, Yemen, Bosnia get attacked?
Putin is mentally ill. Where are russian people now? When they are wake up?
WW3 has begun, Now China Will attack Taiwan.
Meanwhile in America Biden is taking his third nap of the morning

Sad for all the people i hope this doesnt turn global with perhaps 100s of millions dead and injured and entire countries obliterated
stop putin??? bbc should the stop fake news
Never make Putin mad
America fuck yea
I want to de-nazify Ukraine said Hitler MK II
This is just Russia's version of the Cuban Missile Crisis and Bay of Pigs lol
Putin fellowed Trump's orders!
Nothing compared to what America did in Iraq and Afghanistan
I hope people of Ukraine ask their leader to surrender. I don't want them to suffer in this horrible way. My heart goes out to the people of Ukraine.
As this joker declares war, he's probably happily sitting  drinking vodka while all of his puppets are dying and killing innocent  people, all just for the sake of gaining power and lands  for their own interest. None of these corrupted governments give a care for civilians or the military; they only care about money 💰 and power while we kill each other, obeying their narcissist rules and commands, making them feel powerful   their nothing without us if we were smart enough to say no to their fulish commands sadly and unfortunately we don't have the knowledge that takes to understand that and we're too blind to see it

This is what west does. Uses proxy to press forward their agenda and Russia uses the sledgehammer. 🤦
Accept Ukraine into NATO now and send troops to take back the lost lands and hold a discussion with putin to fight or to continue.
So, NATO are just going to standby and let Russia do whatever they want?
Lets hope the next russian president will be better. Stay strong ukraine we all support you 💙💛 Much love I am praying for you from czechia 🇨🇿❤️🇺🇦
Ukrenian fighter jets helped Sri Lanka for money when there was genocide taken place on Tamils in 2009. Now pay back to Ukraine
Horrible people!
Putin stop killing children
It makes my stomach sick to watch this happen. 75+ years of peace and stability in the West will be brought down by this Russian pariah. Putin will drag NATO into this, no doubt about it. Either that or we submit to his brand of authoritarianism. And we get incredibly powerful statements from former US presidents but one. Can you guess which one??? And what will become of us in the West should that person win the next U.S. presidential election? We'll be just like Russia, whom he fan boys all over. God help Ukraine and God help us all. Things are about to get really ugly.
de-nazification? sounds like Putin is planning to reclaim all of WW2 German occupied European nations with that language.. time to hit back.. seize Kaliningrad and hold it hostage just as Putin has Ukraine..
Putin is a lying Mad man. Freedom for Ukraine 🇺🇦
Let's go to war.
ukraine is a fool for trusting the west, they have not learned from georgias war with russia. NATO allies are cowards, they only gang up countries that are weak like libya and syria. What they can only do is bark while their tails are tucked in their assess. they knees are shaking right now and pissing their pants too afraid of the russian bear. poor ukraine, this is a lesson for all to NEVER TRUST THE WEST.
Europe better wake up now. Prepare for Chengiz Khan of the modern time with more deadly weapons and decisive plans fully executed like video games. Europe has been totally unprepared. Arming and militarily preparing has no substitutes. Get over your complacency. Be prepared.
All country needs to boycott russia and its product . A country who cant maintain peace should not be supported .

Joe is not an legitimate Presidency from a fake elections his biggest task and the only reason he is in office is to stop donald trump he's not going to help with Ukraine or anyone else in the world so after this Taiwan will be next this is what we get for electing a career politician and a career Mason who lost Afghanistan and who already let the Russians take Crimea in 2014 he is not in the presidency to work on foreign relations he is in there to control the rest of America
they better live under russian goverment, they would have better salaries, benefits, Ukraine is the poor corrupted country, the descendants of the ukranian nazi, who welcomed Hitler in kiev with bread /salt, who wanted the collapse of the soviet union and after the collapse, they took power in their own hands, people are poor , but russians are discriminated, forced to speak Ukrainian language and pretend they are Ukrainians, by wearing national Ukrainian cloth
If Ukraine is 
Putin must be taken down now
All those pretty Ukrainian girls running around and scared. Sad.
Time to start the engines of our over priced 80 million dollar each!!! F15.
صلي على النبي
What a horrible horrible day for Ukraine 🇺🇦 😢😢😢😢😢😢
And world leaders will stand by and watch while wagging a finger and talking about 
why lmao
Eventually, NATO WILL have to step in. The question is will it be on our terms or the Russian’s.
What is sad is that the EU sold the dream of Democracy to Ukraine, they fought and fought against Putin's criminal behavior and now that he has no choice but to ILLIGALLY invade a country where is everyone? That is Democracy for you, words and wishes but no help. Its a damn Shame!
If Putin is trying to reform a Soviet Union, does he really think this will ever be unifying?
Bravo Putin. Western media is giving half informations, he said he will not invade, not attack. You are witnessing the great power of Russia. Nato domination is over.Zivela Rusija, zivela Srbija!
This is world war 3.
Not just putin even NATO and European union is responsible for this conflict.
As a British I think America and England stirred it all up and now they watching from the sidelines
Putin calling the Ukraine a Nazi regime 🤣😂😅 In the meantime, he's acting like a modern day Hitler. So laughable! 🥲🤣😂😅😆🥲
I trust puttin is right, the BBC and all the other media platforms are trying make Russia look bad like they’ve always done to most great African leaders
My homeworks stress me out, now this shi--
All thanks to Biden and nato going against the agreement
I can't believe this happened and I can't believe the world is going crazy just because of Russia, are you serious people? The citizens of Russia do not want war at all. That would be so stupid, wouldn't it? And they also suffer from the regime of the president. You think it's easy to change something, pffff, well, no - it's not! They even try to help refugees, but no one noticed it...🙄It's not about nationalities, it's about our future and future of our planet as well!All adequate people want to live normally and in peace. Do you know how many people from Ukraine live in Russia, work there, have families and friends? Millions of people!!! And they're not going anywhere, because this is already their home and we're all the same. We are all families! But only Russian citizens will always be ashamed of their government and other people in the world...No one wants war except the governments of big countries...why don't you understand this, people? It's not the Russian's fault...I wouldn't believe all the news you can see on the internet because someone is doing it on purpose...all this is done for their big goals and all people suffer from it. The world makes my heart break... 🇺🇦🇷🇺
Stay strong ukrain!! f@ck putin in his communist bunda <3
Where is UN now?
Is Putin happy with what he is doing to innocent people?
Putin has a micropenis
Putin is a liar!. Putin will hold the Ukraine war criminal!.
Where is NATO 🤣🔥🇷🇺
This is great, Zelensky met his reckoning and Ukraines desire to embrace NATO…this is the result. Putin did a Boss Move!
Don't believe anything that the BBC reports, remember these are the same people that lied to you about a pandemic that never happened.
Sad news wish peace for world. Everyone think about Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya and Palestine how Americans killed them and keep bombing on them and please raise voice for them to.
OH SHUT UP STOOPID PRESIDENT!! 😠 😡 👿
If i'm the president of ukraine i would surrender in front of putin to show what kind of threat we posses and how useless NATO is.
I'm heartbroken
Moral of the story : we all are on our own in this world 🥲
But it can't be a Russian missile!Putin categorically denied any intention to invade or attack Ukraine...and we believe every word he says don't we?🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lets go Brandon. He’s sitting on his hands and allowing the murder of innocent civilians. What if Russia came after USA? Thank God for 2A.

UN wtf u guys are doing??? you guys are dogshit just watching while history is repeating.There will be so many casualities .
Putin has become a madman, he needs to be stopped. He is trying to create chaos every where in the world. the world must stand  with the people of Ukraine.
Why do they love war.. innocent people are being involved in this
Go Vladimir...Bomb this uk/US puppet regime in kyiv back to the stone age .These cowards have been murdering civilians in donetsk and donbass for 8 years.NOT ANY MORE .the spetsnaz will tear these tyrants a new arse  hole .
Men should not be our own global leaders ...
Ukraine citizen must not believe on any other country for help, they must fight on their own and give a tough fight to defend their motherland - god be with u.
Western leaders planned it, so of course they know how it will go. Who knows the Ukrainian president is involved. Most past US presidents and their president's men have always known what disaster was to hilt their nation, armed forces abroad, and unwanted statesmen.It's time people start looking at reality. Stop listening to mainstream news.
I'm sure Sleepy has it under control!
My God! Lord please bring Peace for this 2 country 🙏 its a pity for all innocent people especially childrens. What kind of leader of this  2 country they don't think people lives🙏. Stop fighting because of your misundersting! Let's us pray all over the World for Peace, love, forgiveness, stop that War 🙏
False flag operation?
So sad but NATO bears a lot of responsibility for this outcome
My prayers with Ukraine.
Why people don't learn from our past mistakes? History said it all. Wars offer nothing but devastation. Why ?!
Ukraine needs to defend itself and kill as many Russian troops as possible. 💀
Russia is already a big country . Why is it being so greedy when ukraine doesnot want to be part of it .
The Great Question is?Will US & Nato dare to fight Russia after preparing for this for over 40 years now by surrounding the Russian borders for decades?Or do they only attack poor weak countries who hardly have new hi tech equipments, like pirates.
There should be peacetalk...
What a joke, look I love the Russian people, but their leadership needs to be put behind bars. What a pathetic excuse of a way to go about 'keeping the peace'. Absolute bunch of 5 year olds with nuclear capabilities.
Humanity* bears a lot of responsibility. Us as a species never learn. We always do the same shit, on both sides. Always.
No
Not possible
Im sorry Russians but you should feel ashamed for voting for another Hitler to be your president!
This world is mess when u realise it hurts
Russian cyber attack against a NATO country is attack against them all. They should help Ukraine with military force.
This is horrible,May God end the war and keep the people safe
madness
Neither of the countries people even want this war really, and there’s no justification for the future potential(and past) mass death and destruction  on Putins end besides “Ukraine dangerous, they nazi’s, we good guys” but of course NATO will play their morals game, watch Ukraine be brutalized, then probably try to negotiate Russia’s oil in return for keeping Ukraine-with ‘moral’ stipulations of course. The only way to stop Putin is for the people of Russia to decide if they truly wanna be free, radicalize among themselves, organize, then rebel. Also make sure they get media attention on the movement as well. Media and propaganda is one of the most powerful tools in war now. It can inspire change, sentiment, comaderie, or loathing. So what needs to happen is NATO needs to launch their own large scale propaganda to the Russian people to inflame internal rancor against Putin. That’d probably be one of the only ways NATO would gleefully put their boots down on kremlin soil. Putin is a feral dog and he needs to be put down. But NATO is to afraid of the bite to do so. It’s shameful that we have to sit from afar and watch a burgeoning democracy brutally assaulted by a modern day tyrant. Oh but at least we’re sending our prayers right? That’ll comfort the dying I’m sure. His troops are engaging in war, bows the time and to go after putin, doubt he’s anywhere near the frontlines. NATO needs to strike now. They should’ve prepared for it sooner. Putin is only going to get more power hungry.
Putin lost his mind
This could be next afganistan if people of ukrain are ready to fight. If not Russia will walk through.
every thing they have built by USSR they forget their position and their history of existence now they have to pay for their crime
god  bless  ukraine country..
Nazies? Really? Is Putin smoking the same stuff as Biden or his son? Wow. I guess he has caught retardation from Biden.
It is not putn 's fault.  It is your fault zelenski. Had u stay neutral, thiswo t happen!!!!!
Russia will regret this.
This makes me want to sign up for the military and help. Well if WW3 starts then a draft might be coming. Praying for Ukraine 🇺🇦 Biden I hope you don’t fuck this up
Horrible...very sad... poor peopleSyrian : noobsIraqi : amateurPalestinian : first time
Very bad
Missiles are hitting residential buildings. Calling it self defense is just a flat out lie.
I hope you guys gtfo of there.  Putin is full of shit.
I genuinely hope Russia stops, this won't be a war anyone wants. If 2 major powers collide that's a huge no no for the entire world.
Putin must face the music.

Every news channel is biased to there own governments agenda, so unfortunately we can't believe anything we hear nothings as it seems

West is shit 💩 when they break international law and took Kosovo from Serbia that was ok now Luhansk and Donetsk is problem? West can not pick from table whatever they want and to expect that other will just watch
It's not even the Kremlin's war, it's Putin's war. Of course he wants to 
We need peace but not war and is my prayer that God grants us peace. The war is really bleeding.

The sad thing is it will be the poor people that suffer not the wealthy
The un needs to send soldiers in to help Ukraine 🇺🇦 this is not right and you can’t let evil win
4:31 I don't why my I got water in my eyes👀 🥺
All the information about the situation comes through distorted lenses. The west has been running a divide and conquer scheme here as they did in former Yugoslavia, with the purpose simple piracy, create crisis and then exploit opportunity. Ukraine has ZERO integral connection to the 'North Atlantic'. Great deals of moneys will need to be borrowed by states and great number of lucrative contracts signed. Distortions in the stock markets and the oil price can provide vast speculative profits. The world can be edged into a period of worry and concern. The clever will make handsome profits. Then the whole thing will disappear TOTALLY down the memory hole, like the for-mentioned Yugoslavia. The grand scam again, as always.
Blame the US for this
That lady said Ukraine should lay down their arms, she must be related to Putin smh
Western intelligence did amazingly well. Ukraine should of been welcomed into nato a long long time ago.
Not again🤦🏻‍♂️
Only thing I see here are running escaping
BBC = British Bullshit Corporation......Zalenski = American puppet.
May god protect the civillians
That mess up
What  Europe is  facing  today ,is the  result  of   that   war  crimes   which they conducted  in Muslims  countries, Iraq,Afghanistan, Syria, Pakistan, Palestine, and  criminal silence on Killing  of  kashmiris.
How would merica feel if Russia had plans to put shirt range tactical nukes in Mexico ? Remember the stable genuis pulled out the nuke treaty with Russia. Big american oil does not want russia to sell gas to europe , gotta keep the shekelsteins rich .
Yeah post the hiding spots of all the scared people so the Russians will find them... good job...

World would feel Russia is wrong, though no one really knows the facts.
You licemers remember what are you do in 1999 when you bomb my SERBIA and MONTENEGRO and ocupaid my hollyland Kosovo and MetohiyaThis is nothing like when you bomb hospitals,factures,trains and rest civilian targetBurn in Hell  UK
Putin seems determined just as the US and NATO were determined to have Ukraine in their sphere of influence. So who started it first?
Ukraine has fallen the trap of America. They should be announced to leave the NATO.
Sanctions can’t and won’t stop this
Russia must protect his territory from terrorist organisation NATO
Russia finnaly have balls too get ukraine asses 👍
Mother 🇷🇺 Russia
How can Putin even claim they are threatened by a country they claimed for so long “they poised no threat to us and we are just conducting military exercises”. Now Putin’s claiming protection from Natzi ‘s ! All he wants is a new Soviet Union!

What ever you have to do to legitimately earn money and save it right now I'd start to but don't save it in a bank.
It's totally shit!The biggest murder is communist Party of Vladimir Putin!

Corruption is on the rise there. When they separated from the USSR in 91 ... they were the second economy in Europe, and now they are the poorest country in Europe. Draw your own conclusions.
Putin's a modern hitler.
This is the bad situation of the world .
The beginning of the end
Check out TikTok to see what the civilians are going through
Ukraine Try to learn to be friendly with neighbors rather than unseen mirage the USA.You believed the USA and NATO that they would help but they can't help you right away.
The Pentagon The Russian forces have not yet moved towards the regions of western Ukraine, waiting for them, or are you running your shame and disappointment?!!!!!!!!!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
NATO have enough popcorn to sit and relax! 🤝
Ukranian military non existant 🤦🏻‍♂️
Fight of unequals. But, preparation from Russia were very evident, then why it was not taken seriously to be averted or faced out by Ukraine and other nations, promising to help. I am too worried for worries, life, economy, facilities and more so, the real life of people involved. Prayers for well being and proper mind set for all.
Prayers to Ukraine.  Putin is attacking them bc he only wants power and to control everyone.  Putin attacked out of cold blood , Ukraine isn't a threat to Russia. Ukrane was trying and still trying to defend their country
Yall dumb ass prayers anit gonna do shit. Be fucken realistic! If yall really want to do something get rid of these greedy selfish governments!

Ukrain might be having WMD like Iraq. Look into this angle too BBC
its sad considering ukraine isnt part of nato but only showed interest in which nato cant really do much to aid their military support. they definitely wont stand a chance on russia sadly
Russians will pay!!!
International community should support Ukrainian people with army
lets see.. putin keep saying.. guys.. come on dont bring ukraine to nato .. keep a bit of distance .. nato ignore it like .
This is terrifying, the poor people of Ukraine deserve better than this.
Ukraine civilians:nato, please help usNATO:hold my prayers
Buy only Electric Cars so that Putin has less oil and gas money to fund his war against Ukraine!
Zio-Globalism means peace
Accept Minsk agreement there Ukraine president forgot about pressure from outside powers
To think this shit could happen in the 21st century. Love goes out to the people of Ukraine from down under 🇦🇺🇺🇦
May God’s keeping everyone safe🙏🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️
well if u are a Ukrainian prepare its time to bug out
Western leaders know all about this America and dollar are planned to fall after this all part of Claus schwabs agenda 2030 next all new global citizens will be chipped and tracked and only survivors will move into new digital technocracy not conspiracy anymore the world economic forum have terrible things planned for all of us do your research
All of your thoughts and prayers are fake and meaningless
Putin said to his people that he's only protecting his country.... Wtf🥲
NATO is an organisation of shameless cowards.
the two countries should stop the fighting and be at peace
I understand Russia don’t want Ucrania NATO in his bolder but an Russia invasion to Ucrania is really bad decision.
Kill them all !!!!!
Ukraine and Russian are brothers and EU and NATO try to separate them they remove Yanukovych who was connected with Russia  they removed him with weapon and instal EU and NATO government in Ukraine against Russia,  they want to put Ukraine in NATO in case of war  between NATO and Russia, Ukraine need to fight against Russia that will be stupid all  history they was together or same country… People are stupid  and easy to make them to fight against each other same in Jugoslavija everybody think Milosevic is bad but nobady knows that Izetbegovic and Tudjman was in prison during Tito and the reason is because they was dangerous for Jugoslavija they was fanatics who want to separate and after Tito died USA support this people become president and destroy Jugoslavija. It is easy to see on example when Izetbegovic agree to stop the war and after meeting with USA ambassador day after he take decision back and continue war….  Same things is going everywhere Putin know even more and he will not let them to do things, he will react and put back government in Ukraine who is in brother relationship with Russia not with NATO…but NATO already win with making brothers to fight against each other fully win if Ukraine put in NATO…On 18 March 1992, all three sides signed the agreement; Alija Izetbegović for the Bosniaks, Radovan Karadžić for the Bosnian Serbs and Mate Boban for the Bosnian Croats. On 28 March 1992, after a meeting with US ambassador to Yugoslavia Warren Zimmermann in Sarajevo, Izetbegović withdrew his signature and declared his opposition to any division of Bosnia. What was said and by whom remains unclear. Warren Zimmermann denied that he told Izetbegović that if he withdrew his signature, the United States would grant recognition to Bosnia as an independent state. What is indisputable is that on the same day Izetbegović withdrew his signature and renounced the agreement.Do you believe that USA is so good to give money 5 billion for nothing return no they invest to make problems money and sending weapons NATO want blood between brothers they want to make weak Russia after fail in Syria..they want to make problems at Russia home and then they can  be free to joke in world like with Yugoslavia,Libia…https://youtu.be/rPVs5VuI8XI
Typical BBC outing bloody people at risk by getting Russian citizen’s to say it’s bad
It’s the globalist’s agenda
NATO is an organisation of shameless cowards.
The absolute harsh and sad reality of warThe rest of Europe will say - “this is terrible and awful and we stand with ukraine” What European leaders will do “absolutely f*ck all” Result “ a full invasion” Ukraine, don’t waste your time appealing to other nations for help, they’re all wiling to give you words but simply won’t help, defend yourselves and fight with everything you got, the world’s a cruel place.
NATO should have negotiated with Vladimir Putin but instead Sleepy Joe Biden and NATO marched to the wrong tune and brought all this tragedy to the Ukrainian people. Now NATO will have to put up or shut up. Is it worth a nuclear exchange? I don't think so.
Scary Images, My heart Sinks
??? The US and other NATO countries have been at war in the middle East for every year of the 21st century except for the first one.
God help Ukraine at this time.
Pls spread my message to Russians: https://youtu.be/abRb__ThP1Q
Russia's actions are unacceptablefrom Japan
Still bunch of idiots saying its usa and nato fault.......
I wish nato could indirectly assist Ukraine.
European union is a joke. You can't defend the union then don't call it a union.
🇷🇺 = 💩🇷🇺 = 💩🇷🇺 = 💩

Don't forget Ukrainian have been bombed civilians in Donbass almost 8 years
So begins the battle for the 
I hope the world wipes Russia off the map..
What an absolute cruel ballbag. All because Putin is paranoid about the west and needs to annex another country to protect him from NATO.
Death to america
As a Romanian this is horrible because of they win they will be next to us.
🙄🙄🙄🙄
God bless Ukraine!!!
What does Ukraine lose under a Russian ruler?
we have just been through a pandemic and now we gunna have to fight a full on war ... wtf!
I see everyone’s heart going out to Ukraine… nice but means nothing. Help is what needed not nice words. The impotent European politicians and Biden who has bed soars and not capable to do anything, they need to do something. But nobody will do anything and Putin knows that
All the E.U can do is 
That would require a 3rd world war.
 @Dave  doesnt seem worth dying over
Once I seen that little boy my heart broke the poor families and Ukrainian people this is devastating where is N.A.T.O time to cut the head of the snake 🐍
NOW USA WILL GET IN , BIG MISTAKE MR PUTIN This could has been resolve into a different way .
Beware the Ides of March.
F*CK RUSSIA
Year 2022 dictators still live and freely can make genocide with the countries like UK, US who upholds democracy are doing nothing, we may wake up 5 years from now the rest of the world are under dictators even on this democratic countries. The future fate of mankind where dictators will live until their death causing countless death and agony to the rest of the world. Hitler on Russion boots to invade the rest of Europe then Chinese boots to invade the rest of Asia too?
NORD Atlantic CRIMINAL Organization= NATO.
I feel sorry to Ukraine family,may God have mercy over them, much love from Kenya Africa
in my next life, i will make this people suffer 10x to what they've done today, most of them are leader and wealthy person in every country. i wish them suffer painfully in there next life.
FAKE NEWS MADE BY USA
This is the inevitable result of NATO expansionism and US hegemony. Too bad

If the west, especially US and it's Mistresses(UK, Western Europe/Australia), had listened to Russian demands on indivisible security and a proposed new security architecture for Europe, none of this could have spiral out of control. But, US & UK are hell bent on maintaining their hegemony in Europe, they ignored Russia's genuine concerns and provoked it to act this way, and now, blame them as trouble makers. The US and UK are also fully responsible for what's going right now, not just Putin or Russia. It is war that US and UK wanted against Russia, not the other way around.☮from 🇮🇳.
러시아가 왜 그래?
Where is the might 🇺🇸
It was enough a simple 
We lived through this in Georgia in 2008. Love  and support to our Ukrainian friends 🇬🇪🤝🇺🇦❤️. F..k Putin
Sorry but I'm happy Putin is doing this..that President had over 2 years to get in Nato because he's a dictator. Locking up walking up political adversaries cutting off electricity and water to historically Russian parts of Ukraine. He doesn't deserve to be a president of anywhere they didn't let him because he's a dictator not a democracy. plus he had every opportunity and he had a duty to investigate any claims your suspicions of corruption going on in his country. There was a treaty from 1999 that was signed by Bill Clinton the president of Ukraine of time they said they would investigate corruption on both sides. Just hearing Joe Biden say that they were not going to get the loan guarantees unless they fired the prosecutor the same one that was investigating burisma Holdings the company that his son was on the board for and it wasn't just his son John Kerry's son was on the board too. That President knew everything that was going on I'm sure you knew exactly what Hunter Biden dead and what John Kerry song did and what Joe Biden did and had he done investigation and came out with the truth sleepy Joe would not have been able to run for president with all of the corruption that would have come out. Nancy Pelosi's daughter Adam Schiff his son was over there and Ukraine Mitt Romney has a son who was over there and Ukraine. That's why Mitt Romney had to vote with the Democrats on impeachment because they had that's hard to play they could have come out inside the bad stuff his son was doing over there. That president in Ukraine had every opportunity to make sure is that the truth came out Joe Biden even said himself it was recorded on video that if they didn't fire the prosecutor by the time he left in six hours they weren't getting the money. That's a quid-pro-quo he admitted to a reporter that he told them to fire the prosecutor. Had all that come out imagine how many of these politicians would have been impeached for corruption at least Joe Biden would not have been able to run for president because of all the corruption he was involved in while he was vice president and maybe Nancy Pelosi and some of those fire up Democrats would have been in trouble too. And maybe we wouldn't be in the financial economic horrible disaster we are now. We wouldn't have borders wide open so fentanyl can come over the border and kill people who are expecting to be doing fentanyl they expect to be doing cocaine or even marijuana and it's mixed Fentanyl. The president of Ukraine could have stop Joe Biden being able to run for president. But he kept his mouth shut and did absolutely nothing. He's locked up political adversaries he shut down three new stations and locked up the guy that ran against him for president. He's had two and a half years to get into NATO and they won't let him because he's not a democracy they know that we know how corrupt Ukraine is. And that why did absolutely nothing when it came to looking into corruption he let Trump get impeached and said nothing about the corruption the Biden family had been doing. I hope when he realizes that you'll by noon the Democrats put soldiers into actually fight Russia and start World War 3 just so that he can stay president and Ukraine doesn't get teaching over he's going to realize that they're abandoning him and hopefully he sends information to one of the new station that will be more than enough to get these corrupt politicians out-of-office hopefully there's enough info if he does have it to get Hunter Biden locked up and impeach sleepy Joe and then they can impeach Harris for dereliction of Duty because she's letting the Border stay wide open. I honestly hope that she will sing like a canary with you realize this to you I said everybody else isn't going to fight Russia on his behalf. He wanted surface air Nestle's and the United States and other foreign countries would not give can the missiles that he was asking for. He was getting mad at Kamala Harris because the US was not studying sanctions on Russia before they went in to Ukraine. He thought they should put sanctions on Putin and Russia before they even did anything which would make it more likely that he would do something because if you're getting in trouble for something you didn't do you might as well go and do it. Hopefully he saw how they really are how they're not going to defend him and start World War 3 hopefully he see that and will somehow be able to get info to a good news outlet and it contains enough actual proof to impeach them and we can get those idiots out of office!  I don't like that President but I want him to sing like a canary and take down the politicians and elites by getting them impeached and out! He could have made it so Biden and Harris didn't even get a chance to run but $$ and power. He could have investigated the corruption like the treaty said but nope he didn't he could have saved us from this horrible administration. I hope putin takes him to a labor camp and puts in someone good to run the country! He's like Hitler cutting water and electricity off to historically Russian parts of the country he should be overthrown I'm soo happy Putin did this.i hope no innocent people are hurt I know that's far fetched bc war brings death but I'm still happy putin is finally going to take that President out of office! Good job Mr President Putin!
Where is NATO to help us!?NATO only attack small and weak countries and without UN resolution and approval of Security council, like Russia did now.Double standards brought us here, not Russia.Open your eyes and stop sending stupid messages like 
So do you flee or do you fight or your country, your freedom, and your belongings?What is home?Do you give that up and run or simply let the Russians take over as the Taliban did in Afghanistan?I hope those in Ukraine stand up and fight. The Russians rely upon trucks for supplies. They are simply trucks.Hurt them where it hurts the most. They are attacking you. Make them pay for that attack.Putin wants all the port cities in your country at the very least. Complete military take over is a real option for him. Belarus has sided with Putin and should be under sanctions as well.Belarus has chosen sides and is supporting the invasion of Ukraine.Belarus has made themselves an agressor by allowing Russia to attack the Ukraine from within their country.Stand tall. Be proud. Fight for your future.
I’m in the us & I need to get my family to Africa
Ooh yes plz you are welcome in Africa, God loves us
BBC is not usa channel
 @The Cosmos Channel  Yes but they broadcast US fake news
Trumpanzee lol
 @R  at leat Trump knew how to run a country.. 40-year inflation High 13 American Service members killed in Afghanistan billions of dollars worth equipment. Shutting down the Keystone XL pipeline the country is more divided than ever I won't stop with this covid-19 mandate garbage that they want everybody to go by Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have done absolutely nothing good for our country China is no longer paying their fair share should. Someone Trump was an office to Joe Biden getting an office We are definitely in a worst place in our country that we were when Trump was in at least Trump kept Russia in its place as soon as Trump got in Boonton got out of Ukraine within six months we were the largest exporter of oil in the entire world we had energy Independence We finally had oil and reserves gas was around 2 bucks a gallon what was Black unemployment lowest unemployment for Hispanics and Asians. I'm Puerto Rican and yes I support Trump but I voted for Hillary when Hillary ran and I was a registered democrat from the time I was 18 years old until the last election. I didn't agree with everything Donald Trump was doing It was okay for hunter biting to try to take 120 million dollars out of China from a company that has US sanctions against it that's okay right it's okay for Joe Biden's brother and son to take money out of Romania period It was okay for Hillary to spy on Donald Trump's campaign everything's coming out now they were the ones that expired with people in Russia to find out stuff about Donald Trump they spy on his servers while he was president at the White House. You liberals and Democrats are so out of your mind you don't like someone because of who that person voted for instead of looking at how the economy and life is right now to how the economy in life was when Trump was in office. But you're probably white and liberal you probably don't have to worry about how you're going to feed your kids how you're going to put gas in your car if you have to take one car off the road because you can no longer afford gas and insurance on it and food on your table and to get your kids clothes you probably don't have to worry about that right? You don't have to worry like I do with my son walking home in a bad neighborhood because they decided to defund the police and I have to worry about my son having his cellphone stolen his wallet stolen and getting punched in the face and kicked while he was on the ground and there's no police patrolling where they used to. And I don't have a vehicle anymore to be able to drive him to his friends house under Donald Trump I had an extra vehicle where I could make sure I could drive my son to his friends and with gas and  everything else going up I can't afford the insurance gas to keep our 2nd car.. have to say something about me liking Donald Trump or not liking the Democrats because I liked being able to have a second car and not have to worry about my son getting jumped on his way home from school. Like I said you're probably white and don't have to deal with that kind of stuff am I right? And if you're not white you shouldn't like Joe Biden he walked black and brown people and for-profit prisons with mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug affectionate his 1994 crime bill that he spearheaded nicknamed the Biden crime bill was passed during the early 90s when ceack was ravaging minority communities. . Joe Biden took away funding that Donald Trump gave to historical black colleges and universities Joe Biden get away with that his first day in office to kill the Keystone XL pipeline like I said tons of jobs now we're not energy independent and have to pay for oil from other countries. You don't have to have an IQ above 55 to see the Joe Biden has ruined this country! But you got to put something in there how I like Trump right. Do you like paying extra money for gas at least with Donald Trump gas was two bucks a gallon it's gonna be at least five dollars a gallon everywhere else in the country and it's supposed to get up to seven dollars a gallon in California let's hate Donald Trump and hate anyone that even like some of his policies Because Donald Trump sends mean tweets. .u liberals are a joke
 @Sara Brant  1 million deaths from Covid on trump's watch
Ukraine needs to start lobbing 🚀 back at Russia wtf
Love to the Russian people always, but Putin is losing it. Dumb moves being made in the kremlin.Edit: and ofc love to the Ukrainian people as well. I sincerely hope this blows over quickly and things can once again stabilize.
My heart goes out to the people of Ukraine and the democratic countries
Stay strong ukraine, i hope you wont fall to the nazi dictatorship of russiafrom your western neighbors 🇸🇰❤️🇺🇦
BBC should post news from Myanmar too randi ko chori muji . Garib desh ko ta baal nai gardaina. Meaning : lots of love ❤️
It's lucky to have a smart leader seeing the Ukraine comedy president
As someone who had to flee a country dominated by Russian tyranny (Venezuela). Words can not express how much I hate Putin, socialism, and the political left! This invasion was so obvious due to the decadency of the USA and the weakness of center-left European governments. China and Russia are eating our lunch and the first world is distracted by stupid marxist ideas and Tick Tock in the meantime...
Thanks for objective journalism, BBC.
This horrible war is due to the western push of ukraine to NATO.
:(
Ukraine I pray for your innocent. Lord Jesus Christ have mercy for the innocent and spare no fire for the wicked.
I'm so sorry that the whole world abandoned Ukraine like this. Praying will not help..they will again wait until the last moment..
They literally promised a troop pullback and then launched an invasion. Fuck Ivan.
International community fueled the war, the issues can be settled bilaterally
Never consider USA and GB as your friend and be dependent on them for security...
Prayers don't stop missiles
Make them pay for every kilometer, every meter, every cm of land. The best defence is a good offense..hit the Russian oil refineries. Send a message...we can hurt you.
В Донбассе, Украина, 8 лет мирных людей бомбит и никто из вас не возмущался. 2800 дней и ночей, идёт уничтожение инфраструктуры, жилья, но этого, сытый Запад не видит. Мерзкое двуличие и ложь, главные ваши инструменты пропаганды.
I feel like Ukraine had enough time to get ready for this in the past but they didn't, now look how Russia is coming
Didnt another guy want to eliminate another group of people in the fall of 1939 ?? Now putin wants to de nazi Ukrainian's ...this is not good

i feel bad for ukraine. i hope that russia does not use the same tactics as the US and the west used in irak
We all need to pick up arms against Russia, to hell with putin's threats.
❤I love this video at large but starting the YEAR with a GREAT INVESTMENT should be the wisest thing every individual should do.  I will advice everybody who is into crypto to stick with ETH and BTC as much as you can guys.If everyone sells when it starts to fall, which at one point it will, the dream maybe lost because of it being too volatile for companies to get behind.
Putin said he will attack any country that gets in his way. let's take care of business and show PUTTIN  he can't bully people around we all need to help  Ukraine  NATO is the beast and powerful they would wipe Russia out. No one wants war and on the other hand no one wants to live in a communist world  freedom  freedom  freedom
US has been saying for weeks this was coming.  Putin saying this is all in self defense? How?  Nobody attacked you or wants your shithole country. Nazis? Ok this guy has lost his mind, he's a danger to his own people.
The world is facing two problem one of religious extremist (terrorism)  another is idea of expansion by snatching from weak. May god save everyone from this.. My heart prays for every children who is facing this 😣
And the world will just watch.
Is this what Biden and Putin negotiated?

Putin is a sick man. Insects live in his brain they cause a mental illness.
This shouldn't be happening in 2022,how can you justify attacking a country that had no issues with Russia.. Putin has become unhinged and it's time for him to disappear.!
Shut the fuck up you. Putin, worry about you people poor Russians are suffering while their dictators is playing games
The problem with Putin is one thing he just wants more power he so this is not surprising
NATO  silent mode .....
I've always wandered why the soliders keep fighting for a tyrant, all of them should just stop
I wonder what those who claimed this wouldn't happen have to say now.
Putin does with Ukraine the same Hitler did with URSS in 1941. Betrayal and cruelty. Bombs against civilians; bombs against civil airport. He's just a butcher.
Ukraine should hand out firearms to anyone willing to stay
What's sad is the screws are going to be put to the Russian people and not so much their government, their money will be worthless and investments have already been cut in half in the last few days. Prices will rise drastically. I don't understand why Putin would bother trying to BS the world that Ukraine is somehow a threat to Russia, he's truly delusional. And I don't see Ukraine giving up either, they remember being starved to death by the Soviet Union and being used as cannon fodder against Finland in the winter war.
Hy god pl save people's from this hell
A small nation should not take sides , neutrality is key to peace. Ukraine is paying for taking sides with US
I think they already surrendered.
It's extremely heartbreaking my thoughts and prayers go out to them. It's really nice to see that they're willing to fight and die for their country unlike the cowards in the middle East that expect everyone else to float their bill and solve their problems
I am Ukrainian and infuriated. I told everyone before that Putin is a modern day Hitler, but people laughed it off. To Russians who supported him and his imperialistic rhetoric - you ALL have blood on your hands.

senseless
They are handpicked based on their willingness to obey… The ones with morals and values are weeded out… These are armies of psychopaths…
my thoughts and prayers go out to the Ukrainian people from the UK.
Please Father God protect people of Ukraine specially the children.
Check mate....! It's the end of NATO, UN, and EU..... times have changed... It's President Putin's  war...  China will pop the lolly as well with North Korea Hitting Taiwan.... And America will be Out until Trupm comes in.... The rest is obvious.... God have Mercy on All of us....🙏
Putin is a criminal
4:34 I'm male but it's heartbreaking 😭
Well at least this cements Putins legacy to the world as the evil warmonger he is. Good.
Support Russia from here @india.....
China would do the same shit to Taiwan and boom WW3
pray for the civilians and those who love the world to be a great place to live
The perpetual sex  and the city is over western girls.Conchita Wurtz. and Greta the green psycho are crying .Curse the Pope the Ukrainian Nazi's instigator.
So sad that the west force Putin to took this action.
Weak side always gets condolences ,so i stand with Ukraine .
This is Putin's war. Nobody else wants it. If noone is gunna fight back then hurt them hard in the pocket.
BBC, what about Serbia? Libya? Syria? Iraq? Afghanistan? BBC - Fake news
Im in moldova in chisinau and i heard the explosions at 6 am and it was scary
Go Putin we love you and Russia is number 1. Ukraine today USA tomorrow
NATO is garbage. The alliance is weak and they won’t even stand up for each other.
Ukraine just a training exercise for putin for the rest USSR territories and maybe Europe. You have been warned.
BBC is pro democracy 😂
Wow, an unprovoked attack
What has being male got to do with it
Lmao we found a sympathizer
Good job you and your russian cOmRaDeS are now the real new Nazis
 @skate and create  The Real Nazi's are you the British who annex the greek Cyprus and offered it to Turkey .You have buried Irak for its oil (and now you pretend the green energy lovers),Palestine,Afganistan ,India,East Africa, Argentina's Malvidas  etc. .kiev is the Ancient capital of Holy Russia but you  the British the real Inspiers of Race superiority and therefore great  successful  paradigm for Nazi's regime.Russia's troops overcomes whermaht and breaks the backbone of Hitler's regime while you have fight  Rommel's inferior (by numbers) troops in a desert war..Be haste and Change your mind before in a blink of your eyes you may have seen London buried in its  nuclear ashes.(stop watching James Bond with bad Russians and have an enjoyed covid free sex and the city jurney
Conveniently leaves out what the west did to force putin Lmao of course! Don’t explain yourself nahhhh
America would annihilate you
America destroyed This world
All the lies !! Propoganda all the way!! For months !! I understand putin now . NAVO should back off and usa aswell !!
Typical of world leaders and their craving for power and control. If it's not leaders controlling against the people with vaccines etc, they do it with the violence of war. The Bible mentions all of this will happen in the last days, believers...get ready for Jesus to rescue us from this messed up world soon.
Oh tai naki
As a American I can truly say I love Vladimir Putin anyone that stands with this corrupt American System need to go down and I can truly say I speak for about at least a million black so-called African American when I say if it came down to it in America got into it with Russia we will probably stand with Putin against this corrupt system 👍 keep up the good work against these terrorists Putin
My heart go for for people and Ukraine and  🇺🇦 😞Bless USA And Nato 🇺🇸🇺🇸❤️🗽🇺🇸
40 Ukrainian soldiers are dead omg ..🙏..stop russia
They have no hope. The west has pretended to help Ukraine by sending over pitiful aid and equipment and hitting Russia with very soft sanctions. The truth is that NATO won’t get involved unless Russians touch NATO land. Sorry Ukraine but yous will be under Russias rule.
Mad man haha
USA and uk and Nato What’s resins Target 🎯 Iraq and Libya and Syria and Afghanistan 🇦🇫 explain to Iraq people and Syria peoples and Libya peoples and Afghanistan peoples 🤔🤔🤔
All because of one guy with a big ego.....let him know Hitler and the rest followed the same route but now they are long gone! War and military power is no solution to any conflict. My prayers for Ukrainians especially the children.
Praise the Lord, and pass the ammunition. Live free or die
It is sad that we are in 2022 and there is still pain suffering death and fighting like we are caveman....and for what is all this suffering? What is the purpose of all this??
praying for all innocent civilians, dogs and cats...
This is the prelude to WW3. We saw when hitler wasn’t opposed in his conquest of Europe. We are nearing the point of no return. ACTION MUST HAPPEN NOW. COMMIT FORCES BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE. APPEASEMENT HAS NEVER WORKED!
Russia needs to be destroyed
The DOW took another disastrous hit this morning it's just going to continue taking however there was some good news for me during a rotten time in that I won't be homeless yet.
Ukrain is in trouble...!😭
School was cancelled…. Yeah you would hope considering they are getting invaded
Ukraine abandon by US, NATO and their allies, they are first to runaway and let Ukrainians to defend themselves, what a shame.

America should nuke China, NK, and Russia at the same time
Meanwhile American troops are in Ukraine actively helping de-escalation. Shut up.
 @skate and create  Don’t listen and read fake news from American media, Americans are few of the earliest ppl to get packed and leave. But still letting few Americans troops to die so America can interfere everywhere they want, doesn’t mean anything. Prior to this, America did the same in Afghanistan, abandon and left Afghans to defend themselves, leave some American troops there but few get killed by suicide bomber, when US want to stop ?
Please God save many lives in Ukraine,why that's happening in our world? Please God 🙏
Blame biden for this not Putin
Why you wanna be a bad nasty neighbor to PUTIN? You think he will accept a 4 minute missile to Moscow to be put in Ukraine!Well Ukraine will be deviled to 3 countries.
I don’t  understand why their stupid soldiers follow his orders.
Fight against the Russian troop
Where is super power America ?
Wish we would’ve helped them
Putin's a serial killer
SAVE THE Queen, that the only change not start the War in pacific area.
reckless  destabilizing  of the world! Like we don't have enough problems!!! COP ?
Blame the US 🇺🇸 and NATO for the constant provocation.
Only Belarus and  China would have sided with Russia
I don't get why the Ukrainian leaders insist on joining NATO so bad when we all knew that this was the end result?
Ukranian peoples mind changes every 10 second. Why. They do not know whos fault it is. Is it NATO and America. Is it Zelenskys Nazi regime. Is it Luganks and Donetsk. Why is it that nobody accepted and signed the agreement. Is it because there is so many people around Europe and the USA involved to sign a stupid document. Why should Europe and USA must sign something which is not their territory. Is Luganks and Donetsk in europe or amerika. Where is it situated. Which countries should debate about its future. USA ofcourse not, as well as Europe. Who is the on Who must decide over their future.
Again it's governments making decisions of normal everyday people
This is not our fight, and our elitist owned MSM needs to stop trying to convince us otherwise.  We’re wise to your scare tactics, and we no longer believe anything you report.
This is nothing but the the agreed massacre of Ukrainian nationalists. The West and Russia are in on it together at the behest of their Khazari overlords. Fuck this planet, you all deserve the flood.
Ah shit, smells like World War 3 to me
Ok where's the Ukrainian army at
Ok Trump boy
 @skate and create   just happened in biden's presidency, PUTIN is defending his country, that's all
BIG SUPPORT FOR RUSSIAN BROTHERS! FINALLY SOMEONE TO STAND AGAINST SA7ANISM OF NATO AND THEIR LEADER --VATICAN. Hopefully Ukrain people will learn lesson this time and rejoin Russia because thats the only way to avoid burring their children. I hope they will stop supporting terroristic organisation called NATO who brutally occupied Afganistan Pakistan Yugoslavia and murdered thousands of innocent children!
The time for talk is over. NATO has the ability to destroy the Russian forces in Ukraine and should immediately begin airstrikes and deployment of heavy weapons in support of the Ukrainian government. What are we waiting for?
well what did Nato think would happen if they armed Ukraine.
Ok Now let’s see how Europe and rest of the world going to respond to this Russians killings innocent people.
I have just been to clubhouse and i was shocked. Nobody cares about the ukraine, they just talk about how its related to africa, bitcoin, rockefellers and biden and about war they say; thats how war is. No talk about putin and his agenda at all. No concern about the ukraine at all.
DE-NACZIFIET!!!
Hope one day kind people lead the world who pick out peace instead of war.😔😔😔😔
Hope everyone is safe. Such a difficult moment .Feel so bad for Ukrainian people . please  God protect them🙏🏻🙏🏻
Америка. Не будите спящего льва.
If you people had more than “thoughts and prayers”, this wouldn’t have happened. I hope we have more than thoughts and prayers when Putin comes for us.
god be with you Ukraine, Putin is an evil worthless piece of shit
The drum beats
Weak Diaper Load Biden and the democrats have caused all of this.
We wait decisions of UN and NATO to stop that war, to stop effectively Putin act of war..
Anything what touches USA ends up with the war and death. You invade in countries, take all the resources and destroy them at the end. And it’s never enough for great USA, out of greed you want more and more. And the rest of the world are just keeping quite, the poor has no choice to resist or to say smith against the great USA, they will be liquidated, they don’t want to end up like Iran and Irak and many more countries that USA destroyed. USA has the history of slavery, taking everything they want, telling big lies and at the end they always manage to come out as heroes, wow .. that’s a talent, let me admit that.
De nazification of the Ukraine ? The leader is Jewish.
The united states of America was busy over the last thirty years destroying all rules of international relations between countries by waging unnecessary wars against defenseless nation's and now it seems that the think that the Ginny can easily be put back into the bottle no way other countries have seen what the rules are and the rules is for the strong and powerful so when the united States blockade Cuba, sanction and threaten Venezuela with war it is normal well because somehow Venezuela is a socialist country and America has the right to democratize them well sorry this is simply not true it's an attack on their sovereignty but somehow some people will like to convince you otherwise or maybe take the invasion of Iraq or Libya or even the occupation of Syria maybe let's go back further into history Vietnam how many people died well of course it's for democracy come on people it's time to call a spade a spade Israel Is constantly bombarding Syria and what are they so called international community doing about it nothing no sanctions no actions nothing so you want us to condemn Russia well we will but only if you sanction Israel or Saudi Arabia UAE for waging a war in Yemen and Syria respectively so with all this I have to say that the united States of America has failed as a global leader and therefore the world needs to turn a page in human history they might not like or want it but that is exactly what will happen sooner rather than later.
If US stay passive about this, its allies will be forced to go with only option which is to go nukes.
Russia🤢🤮🤮
Please don't hate average Russian citizens, we are against the war too. Putin is a new Stalin

Why hasn't anyone just thought of taking out putin? He's one man it ain't difficult
People with money exploiting their power shame on you Russia
May god help and save Ukrainian people , you got big support from Bulgaria. No more brothers war...
Human life is one of the cheapest thing i have ever seen
Putin the new Hitler. The world should condemn his demonic action. Pray for Ukraine.
This world is all about give and take.  Conflict arise if you can't do one or two
5:05 He is Not Ukranian.!!!
If President Trump were still in office, this wouldn’t be happening. #FJB
The only reason people care is because this is happening in a European Country. If this was happening in a Brown or Black County then no one would give a crap.
I give love to 🇺🇦 from the United States
He's an evil man.  May his soul suffer
All this has been planned by the powers of darkness with vatican, western heads of states and Russian and Chinese top leaders. The reason is another secret accomplishment in the US agenda against her citizens. Ukraine is a decoy, a smokescreen, just like were 9/11, ISIS, and UB Laden before then, the titanic, WWI, WWII, Vietnam, and many other wars and national upheavals. All involve loss of lives to make the deception look true.Vatican, US, Russian, European, Japanese, Chinese, heads of states have been at this game for centuries. Who wins? the vatican and the leaders of western nations. They get richer and richer, and more powerful by the minute in wicked rulership.Follow this series that started part 1 in 2017. It is since 2020 on part 31. The secret, dark, deceptive moves of the vatican, the US and western heads of states against all humanity, but themselves.https://youtu.be/eqKSEbjJSus?list=PLIetHcViVLfgaF_V7zgAa-YSWfGMVRnnZ
America Cooking all this mess this is Exactly how they destroy my country
The People from both sides don't want the war.
this is a distraction to stop global protests
Lets see if white Christian countries are going to help Ukraine. Especially USA!! She has been involved numerous times all over Africa. Also the United nations!!! Let's hope they will send troops at the border of Ukraine and Russia.
Cry more loser
no one cared about chechnya or afganistan, lmao sure. poor black/brown (lol) people so unfair
Where is America and nato
People who are saying war is bad, i would like ask them where were thay when us was attacking other countries
He needs to be stopped before lives are lost
It's not 1940 right now. I can't understand Russia's inhumane pressure in 2022.I hope the nightmare in Ukraine ends as soon as possible.I hope there are no more sacrifices.
Wo sind die Corona Mund Schutz.? Sind die Wahnsinn in der EU zu kommen ohne Maske. Wo sama den?😂😂😂😂
What about the famine in India BBC and how millions of people died and it was you British fault
God be with Ukraine!
In the name of power do not destroy the human life guys.
America and  Briton have power to shows war through channel, if you have backbone support Ukraine with your military power.
It’s remind me Iraq, Afghanistan,Syria,libiya
it reminds me of how the policy of appeasement worked. it didn't. I agree with the opinions of the people, that if this dosent stop, it will escalate to the third world war, like the annexation of Czechoslovakia in the 1930s', like Poland in 39.
the world has gone  mad
Damn
we all should have to pray to our GODs .for ukrain .anyone can do. even belongs to any religion.show your kindness guys.do your good deed .
United States president Joe Biden die before Russia president Vladimir Putin military attack Ukraine
My heart goes out to the opressed Russians in nazi Ukraine.
Do not trust BBC as used to be lying on Ethiopia recently.
This is terrifying. How can this happen in 2022? How many people are going to die? And for what? This is just unbelievable.
Adolf Putin showing his true intentions
this is the consequence of a comedy actor taking charge of a country
He says it's a war against the 
Is US going to send in troops?
Only Donald Trump could have stood up to this Tyrant , Biden is a mouse
Vladimir is a proud and arrogant man,buut his prestige and prudness wiill make him kneel down whe he aged coz his back will arc  and he's proud no more!
Why don't we just sort out Britain's borders first... Every day myLittle town gets invaded by boats of them... I don't see the BBCBBC presenters and camera men all over our beachesWatching this invasionThey invaded Ukraine before when OBAMA WAS PRESIDENT NOW THEY DO IT AGAIN UNDER MR MAGOO BIDENTHEY DIDN'T DO IT UNDER TRUMP .... MmmmmmmFUNNY THAT 💯🇬🇧
Not supporting military action of Russia . But the west is very very hypocritical. The British can sell diago Garcia to the US and displace the indigenous people and refuse their right to claim back their home island. But Russia cannot claim back Ukraine?
🙏🇺🇦❤️
Peace will never come as long as Ukraine join NATO FORCE .How would USA feel if Russia starts to join forces with USA Neighbours ???I don't understand why USA/NATO had to build defensive forces on Russia Neighbouring Countries .Face the consequence now 🤦
similar to 1999 when NATO bombs killed Serbs. Then there were no sanctions against NATO countries. Fuck of CNN
Stop fighting. Russia will take good care of you. You have my word.
❗Russia has waited 8 years for Ukraine to implement signed Minsk Agreement & stop shelling and killing a population of 2 million people in eastern parts of Ukraine, the Donbass region, with 14,000 dead so far in Donetsk and Lughansk areas. Then Putin waited 3 days to see if the shelling would stop after both were recognized by Russia. But it didn't. 8 years of patience is more than long enough. (West would have acted much earlier & called it some Hollywood name like 
фак Н А Т О !!!!
USSR(RUSSIA) Putin# brainless president on planet earth.
Pray for Iraqi and Syria first.
This is so terrible.

Putin calling Ukrainians Nazis? What? Putin is the one acting like an insane dictator
What now Biden, what now NATO??? this is like Afghanistan 2.0 we just put more useless sanctions.
THE WAR ONGOING ON EARTH RIGHT NOW IS A PROPHECY THAT WAS GIVEN BY ELIJAH THE ANCIENT MIGHTIEST PROPHET OF ISRAEL IN THIS GENERATION.It is amazing that majority of Humanity are totally unaware of what is happening on Earth right now.The war that is ongoing is a prophecy given long ago by ELIJAH THE ANCIENT MIGHTIEST PROPHET OF ISRAEL(The only true Prophet of God on earth right now).In that prophecy that has a  registered 100% accuracy,He said that A HISTORIC WAR was coming to the earth and with all the finner details,and He added that the war will be propagated by the apocalyptic horsemen of Revelation 11.This are the events written in the Bible on the countdown towards the Glorious Coming of the Messiah.Immedially ELIJAH THE ANCIENT GREATEST PROPHET OF ISRAEL re-entered the earth we knew life would never be the same again,nowonder He even knew Coronavirus was coming 4years before it happened.Watch the prophecy of the ongoing war on YouTube via this link as given by THE TWO MIGHTIEST PROPHETS OF REVELATION CHAPTER 11 long ago👇https://youtu.be/tMjFMHc_o5sThe other prophecy👇https://youtu.be/mu_PdJNJaI0
Welp
Welp god is dead and so is Ukraine 🇺🇦 future 😔
Beckons self defense but has had ukraine in his mind for over a decade. Imperialist scum.
We want Ukraine as a Russian land
This is in the military part of the airport
Good job Russian army
I just have the feeling, since trump have good relationship with Putin, and planning to be president again, who is going to be blamed later on == Biden, according to a few records, trump talk to Putin about taking Ukraine while ago....
What a horrible way to achieve something if things don't go according to you. Such a shameful act as a human .
The USA abandoned them. Just like how they did Afganistán. Lessened learned here, don’t roll with the USA. You’ll probably be safer under russia.
Putin, what a prick. He says they are invading in self-defense and preservation for Russias future. Ukraine knows they're outnumbered, that's why they've been asking for help from the UN. Russia is only threatened by Ukraine because they want to join the West and Russia wants nothing more than complete power. Russia invading is not self-defense, it is a declaration of war and a want to dissolve Ukraine into new western Russia territory
Ukraine, just please join the NATO for more support
Putin is evil. Russians should kick him out of office!
This is the result of friendship with the United States and NATO.  All the world's problems are rooted in the selfishness of America's oppressive policies against other countries.  I am very sad for the Ukrainian people. 💚
Russia, UK, US, Ukraine, and the leaders of all other nations are on one team : The Jay Bankers. The ends are being played against the middl. The destruction of white, unmixed, Anglo-Saxon, Keltic, Germanic, Scandinavian and kindered people is the goal.Repent of your sins and return to Yahweh your God, who came to us in the flesh as Jesus Christ. You, white people, are the children of Israel. The no-neck, squat demons in the little beanies, are imposters who were and have always been the enemy of our God and our people. Time is short. Repent.
🤣🤣🤣

This is murder. Such a nightmare!
The Ukrainian puppet regime cowards have been murdering civilians in donetsk and donbass for 8 years .Now let's see how they do against the spetsnaz .
THIS IS INSANE
Ukraine is Russia
Like Corona it appeared and I thought just a little disease it will go away. But we are in Lockdown now and russia conflict seemed surreal too and now they're BOMBING Ukraina.
Oh stop that idiot propaganda.I get reports from people on the ground that1) Russia already has air superiority (within hours). Of course you attack all over the place against those installations, to save human lives. What else did you think would happen?2) Putin promised Ukrain military full amnesty if they do not fight. Many are surrendering. Which again saves human lives.3) Many on the streets in Mariopol, Charkov, etc welcoming the Russian peacekeeper force. That will be less more towards the west.4) Russia is attacking military installations / fighting soldiers only. Not civilians or cities. I question your short piece of video with wrecked apartment buildings. Give us a source so we can verify where this is and who may have wrecked it. Otherwise i consider it sheer propaganda. It is very easy to find some old, abandoned apartment buildings ready for desctruction and create some smoke and fire , then state it was bombed. Weve seen more such propaganda fro MSM, which later turned out to be all false and even instigated as a false flag to blame the other party. (
Stay strong Ukranian people. Jesus is our strength and refuge
What can we do? Why can't we just fly over and fight with Ukraine!!!!
To some extent Biden wants this war just as bad as Putin, so the EU cannot buy oil and gas from Russia, guess who will then be the largest exporter of oil and gas to EU.
So what are other countries doing about it? Will they wait until all the innocent civilians are dead?
if putin is stopped with millitary means will definately  start ww3. you dont need to be smart to know that.there is only one way, to solve it through deplomatic means, and both sides need to get bit flexible for sake of all humanity.
So it has begun
This actor and joker can't handle Ukraine crisis
Next Target Is Poland
Bible prophecies of one world order, nation rising against nation, one world religion are unfolding before our eyes. Soon rapture and tribulation. that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.
Why the western media says putin does putin wants why they dont say russia wants russia does.
A hole of the year award goes to… Putin
Dear BBC hypocrites. Where were you when NATO did the same to Yugoslavia?
Can Putin sympathizers finally admit he is a conniving, deceitful, untrustworthy piece of shit?
Ukraine needs to go to learn the lesson in Afghanistan Iraq Syria Lybia Vietnam and Laos 🇱🇦 Enough is enough stop being Dogs for outside Devil 😈 and bring your country to war. Now the Devil are hungry they are not just playing in Ukraine but they are playing around the world and now they are playing in Myanma too look.
didnt even watched past the first bit. but just peeked through here and there.This is sheer propaganda.Shame on you bbc
It's like a movie, unbelievable
Somebody needs to keep an eye on China as well Putin may have them up his sleeve...😠😠
Putin looks really angry
This happen the bible profacy Jesus Christ is comin soon
Such a difficult moment to ukraine people 👍🇺🇦👍
Long live Putin The Great
As the guy said in 6:43 min this is the beginning of the 3thrd world wars 🥲
I’m so worried for Ukrainians. I’m sending prayers for peace and safety 🇺🇦
We're is nato
De-militarisation? More like de-population...
War between USA and russia but sadly USA used to choose as battlefiled ukrain. Ukranians must understand USA's dirty conspiracy behind it.
BBC the imperial mouthpiece
Russia is very clearly committing some of the exact same war crimes for which Nazis were tried in Nuremberg, starting with the initiation of this war.
Well they can come to America our borders are wide open🇺🇸1s😎
в отличии от армии сша стрельба не велась по школам, детским садам, жилым кварталам...а на съемках какое то нежилое здание... для фейка жилого не нашлось? или жильцы побили когда вы сунулись с предложением поджечь их дом
Best outcome would Ukraine to lay down wepons.
dear Putin.  come to germany to free us for the second time
Putin looks like Hitler.   It must be time to help the Ukrainian people with massive military force of allies against the Russian government.   I think it's time to help defend Ukraine.
insallah putin the great allah

If Putin Swallow Ukraine he will swallow More of European countries and he will become emperor again 🧐Then Russia up 🔼  USA and Europe  down ⬇️ ,😑,
This could rapidly escalate and get out of control for all of Europe. The EU and NATO should be concerned and preparing for WW III
Isn't it a war crime to hit civilian target
Stand with Ukraine
Thank you BBC for educating people that Russian people have nothing to do with this and neither support that.
Why didn’t western countries try and talk them out of wanting to join NATO. The US, Canada and the others have helped to start a war that they have no intention of fighting. Just like with Crimea. The Ukraine will not win against Russia. All that will happen is that Russia will defeat it and most likely install a leader that will be pro Russian.
Russian sympathizers real quiet in the comments rn
This is BS. BBC adding words to what Putin said.  I would be happy if UK & US would have the balls to send their troops into Donetsk & Lugansk.
Donald Trump wasn't there to stop Russia , BLM is to blame for US stolen election and US weakness
Putin is a man I would never underestimate.
You can’t believe anything that the media or the news tells you especially during times of war, all propaganda. All these things are far more complex than what we think and your preconditioning prepares you and primes you to receive their lies and react in just the way they would want you to for their end result
Putin:  'I didn't want to kick the cute puppy but he was threatening me!'
World War is imminent
Putin has gone crazy..
The BBC will tell you what to believe
Nov 6, 1943...... the Soviet Red Army entered Kviv, liberating the city from the nazis, after very ferocious combatsFeb 23, 2022..... the Red Armed Forces attack Kviv, bombardment of some 
No one wants conflict but there are people that don't care that you don't want conflict. Stand up and fight back.
I blame America and nato for this
Nothing is Nobody's...Everything is somebody elses'...GodThe sudden War plan is also His plan...The Harvest is ripe and lo He comes soon....Get Ready...after this One World Order, One world religion and Economy
We can only hope this doesn't spark a world war. My thoughts and hopes are for the safety and well being of the people everywhere. We're the ones that'll suffer because of Putin. Even the wealthy will feel the crunch and it may hit them the hardest, they're not use to being poor living on next to nothing.

I think president Putin is full of s***
so deep..
 @Macho  and so true.
I wanna see blud
You were not so humane when NATO criminals bombed my country in 1999 huh?? Western Hypocrites ... 🙄
Good! Russia is  showing the leadership where the US and EU fail. Go Russia GO.
At least Putin has a ton of crackpot arguments to back this invasion up and he knows his people is gullible enough to cheer for him while he fills their ears and minds with unrefined horseshit
Putin is the new Hitler.
All my thoughts go to the Ukrainian people both rebel and civilian, it's horrible to see Putin essentially lie about not attacking and then claiming the Ukraine have orchestrated a genocide vs the Russian people! I'm not sure if this is true or not but i keep hearing it's a plain lie, Putin needs to be dealt with, attacking civilian airports and homes is disgraceful. Surely Western armies need to step up and provide humanitarian aid before it's too late like what happened in WWII.
Lock n load them AR’s boys
Wow when we were told elections have consequences who’d have thought Biden’s election after barely a year would lead to this ? His weakness and appalling misjudgements have led to this tragedy . Dictators love weak and incompetent leaders they have a beauty in Biden.
Who knows if they're showing you footage from recently or have tons stored up to pass off as new from when Biden was Vice President and the Neo-Nazis took over Ukraine?
We must stand together as humankind who love freedom, justice and peace. My thoughts with Ukraine people from Hong Kong.
This is insane my heart goes out to Ukraine!
우크라이나 국민 여러분 힘내세요모두가 안전하길 기원합니다
Stay safe. Lots of love from Sweden to Ukraine❤️❤️
This guy just told there was no wars in between 1939 and 2022 xD yes, no Vietnam war as well
war is terible
Meanwhile middle eastern countries that plead for peace and dont want to get liberated by NATO doesn’t get half this coverage or concern and gets absolutely fucked beyond words
The one man is right ww3 if he's not stopped
US better prepare for war. I think in our spare time every able bodied man between 18 and 40 should get mandatory firearm practice funded by the us on their off days. I believe we all need to be prepared for a worse case scenario and its better to train now than to send in people unprepared.

This is so that you have nothing else to attack Donetsk and Lugansk, Ukrainian Nazis!
We in Russia have uncles and grandmothers in Ukraine, it's very hard to us.
Why did Obama and Trump force multiply and fund Nazis in Ukraine? ...is that an ok thing to do now?
Let's see what Grandpa Biden has to say... That'll show how important Ukraine actually is for the West
It’s quite possible to financially break Russia until it’s own people finally get rid of Putin once and for all.
Sad day indeed......
How can't you understand that Russia bombs only military infrastructure. Russia don't touch civilians. Did american news say that Ukraine killed over 13000 civilians in LPR and DPR? that Russia took thousands civilians from Luhansk and Donetsk? that most of guns that Ukraine was bombing Republics are form NATO? USA said that Russia said that LPR and DPR are independent and Russia can't do that. Why Russia can't? USA said Kosovo is independent. So USA can, Russia can't? People from West! Please! Don't believe to lie that your news say to you! You need to know the truth! You also don't know the truth about Georgia, Abhasia, South Osetia! Search truth! It is a lot paths, but truth only one!
Tzars answer to no one, and just like Nicholas II when the seacret police do theTzars bidding there is zero democrecy!!!! People just disapear never to be heard from again!!! Welcome from one despot to another!!!!
Google the term 'Holodor' and you'll see the Soviets have mass murdered Ukrainians before.  Holodor occurred in 1932-33.  Holodomor translated to 
US and NATO fuc*ed Ukraine will false promises.
And what the hell is Biden going to do?Nothing I bet.
If you want to help Ukr. we have only one way as Europeans. All the Ru. people you see attack them in the streets, that's the only way they will be determined by the fear of being attacked by their acquaintances and civilian friends in Europe to go on the streets and take little Pu from power. Only the Russians can stop him! And the Russians will react only to the fear of being the Europe citizen target and excluded!
It would be great if there was a reward in crypto for putins demise
Wouldn’t this video help Russia maybe see where all the people at and make them throw a bomb ?
1:55 
What happen to US, UN, EU and NATO, fight with RUSSIA
Just wait China CCP will invade Taiwan, Putin and Xi know they will get away with it and given the territory as appeasement and the war will escalate.   See how Putin uses the same words to describe them as Canada's 
This senseless violence needs to stop. It’s the people at the top that drag us into these wars, while the only ones suffering are the innocent people. Most of us have compassion and respect for those no matter there culture or nationality and it’s sad that we can be convinced to kill for the interests of the few… my heart goes out to all the innocent victims of this, and all the conflicts around the globe ✌🏽
I looked up to Putin as I grew up. But I'm ashamed of myself for liking him my foot. I hope you met the same fate one day
u volunteer and fight on the front if ur so hard brother
Nuke  russia
Th.e casualties will be innocent people. How are the elderly and the children going to cope....Prayers are for them to be safe .
WW3 its going to happen, just end them.
Sincere condolences to Ukraine and deep regret will come to putin and it will be remorseful. 🇺🇦 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
NATO (No Action Talk Only)
So sad and my heart is with Ukraine people
Where is Superman Iron man & Thor to help Ukraine
Mans says “Yeahhh we don’t feel safe with a country in NATO next door, so this is in self defense” I can’t wait to see how far that self defense gets you when everyone in NATO comes for Russias throat
Ukraine refugees inbound.
I see a lot of praying for Ukraine and my heart breaks for Ukraine comments but very few condemning Russia's thug tyrannical leader. What a piece of human garbage he is!
I THINK BETTER WORTHY MYSELF THAN FAKE PRESENCE DESPITE I AM BEING A VAGUE ONE,
🇺🇦
what I hear from russian people: Ukrainians must surrender, because war is SO HORRIBLE! do they even hear themselves 🤦‍♀
Scene: the end of term school prom. Dylan’s Masters of War provides the soundtrack.Putin to Zelensky: “Remember when we were so good together?”Zelensky to NATO: “Just think how good we could be together?”NATO to the USA: “We’ve always been so good together.” USA to Russia: “We’ve had our moments but it’s time to go our separate ways forever.  😳
You do realise this is a retaliation, Ukrainian killed some Russians…. Obviously it sucks for the innocent people but it’s fair game, this isn’t an unprovoked attacked
India should learn something from Russia
Middle east had suffer more than this. This is normal
Belarus should be boycotted and sanctioned
It's been written....end of mankind...saying no more...

Let Russians keep burning money PUTINS rage towards Ukraine will economically drown Russia.
If u s and the nato can’t help Ukraine than the world would not believe u s and nato any more. China will do the same thing
Watch the Russian will find the dirt in Biden n Hunter.
Shame on you Russian Government… killing innocent Ukrainian people for no reason.. we American 🇺🇸 stand with innocent nations. America will give them back hardly..
Esos son los países civilizados.
Putin is a thieving liar.
Disgusting!! People deserve to live without war
Nato leaders must recall how many war crimes they had committed in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and Libya. Where are Bush, Blair and Sarkozy?. Who will try them for henious war crimes and killing of millions of Innocent people worldwide.
WW3 ABOUT TO START .
First china spread covid ,now russiais killing ppl,these countries & their leaders are against humanity.God save humanity from these monsters.
Ukrane should adopt the guarilla war fare ,never should they fight directly
For Britain to take the high moral ground is simply ridiculous! For BBC pretending unbiased broadcasting is even more ridiculous! Compare to when Britain + Americans were bombing Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and elsewhere.
FUCK NATO
The bear has fallen into Biden's trap. He has stuck his paw in the honey pot, and unless he unclenches his paw, and lets go, he won't be able to pull it back out. But he won't do that, instead he will fight to keep the honey, and wear himself out. Then the hunter will come when he is weak from struggling, and with a single tap on the head with a big stick it will be bear steaks, and bear grease for all. Biden will get a bear skin rug for the white house, and the adoration of the world for stopping the bear from terrorizing everyone. Europe, and Asia will get the oil, and Putin will get dragged into the street, and shot by his own people. I'll never understand how a person's ego gets so big that no amount of money, or power will satisfy it. How they think it's ok to kill others to feed their lust. He shall reap what he sows.
especially in Iraq and Siria and Afghanistan right ?
and before... Vietnam... Iraq,, Afghanistan... Siria... who's next?
 @jim dilian   Afganistan was made first playground by russia, later u.s after 9/11, vietnam was U.S, iraq was uk & u.s, india's many states by russia,  all greedy corporates are minsters & ordinary ppl who are huge in number are mere experimental subjects against them, as ordinary human are zero in understanding politics.

end of the day Ukraine/Ukrainian will pay off for all these damages not EU or USA. #stopwar
This is what is happening in Kyiv right now: FISHING show 2022: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCNWygfhqcQ
Three protesters and BBC calls 
Wait, i though the war doesnt involve civilian . Why they bombed civilian ???? Is this not abwar crime ????
youtube... THIS IS THE REASON WHY WE NEED DISLIKE BUTTON! BRING BACK DISLIKE BUTTON
All Thanks to NATO ¡ Bravo to the WEST ¡
Open your eyes people. 8 millions peoples in East Ukraine. And  Ukraine nacy army want to kill them.  Europe did nothing to stop killing. RUSSIA did.
It's all happening BCS of NATO.... Russia never allow NATO base near it's border and ....what NATO did in middle East and Libya .. Putin know !
Total blockade of Russia for 100 years.
Luganks and Donetsk are now sovereign countries.
RIP ukraine, i say we nuke the mfer
Blame US, NATO, UK and allies for provocations and intimidations against Russia, Ukraine make wrong decision end up as punching bag of great powers.
The West have to intervene. This is an unwarranted attack on a sovereign nation. It could be the start of world war 3. We should all be fearful of this escalating. Severe economic sanctions aren't enough. Military support is needed to support the people of Ukraine.
NATO only attacks countries that are 3rd world nations, weak militaries, weak governments and disorganised establishments!  NATO dies not want to take on Russia or Put in who clearly is a better leader then all the leaders in the West put together!
God help the people of Ukraine
Have you forgotten the aggression and bombing in 1999 of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, today's Serbia? Hypocrites Western, You have violated all international rights, seized part of our historical territory, destroyed, blackmailed, targeted civilians, hospitals and all key points of a state, all to the detriment of the Serbian people? Shame on you, unseen hypocrisy
THIS MAN HAS LOST HIS MIND ... OBSESSED WITH CONQURING THE WORLD NOW !!!ITS SAID HE HAS BEEN ISOLATED FOR YEARS AND NO ONE CAN ADVISE HIM ON ANYTHING OR WILL BE JAILED OR KILLED... YES THIS REFLECTS ON THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE ALSO !!RUSSIAN MUST RISE UP AND STOP THIS INSANITY !!
Why does it feel like we're not being told something or that a key piece of information is missing from these 
What is the real reason to destroy lives so freely ? Distraction from the Westerns ? Could it be  ?
Thoughts and prayers from the whole world are with innocent Ukrainians at this critical moment. Stay safe and stay strong. 🇸🇬🇺🇦
The rest of the Free World needs to stop this immediately
The west feels still no need to match the Russian threat? Russia is capable of marching all the way to Paris or Berlin unchecked
🙏 praying for Ukraine
I am praying that the Ukrainian is ok and no one is ded pray for them 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢 sadd I feel bad for Ukrainian hopefully everything and everyone is alright there is dangerous I am scared and shocked 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱🤯💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
Das sind die Jesuiten, Knights of Malta, the Agents of Chaos they want to play us against each other.
Zelensky you are just a bitter horror movie actor who managed to bury Ukraine!  Did you forget how much Ukraine gained through the transit of Russian gas on its territory or how much Russia helped you in 1991 !?  You have managed to bring Ukraine to the brink of collapse through your exacerbated nationalism!  You see, the Romanians don't love you too much either, because the Northern Bukovina that the Russians took from us belongs to Ukraine, but I see that it hurts your ass against the Romanian minority in your country !, I hope you break your throat!
Putin and his gang needs to be put down, but by his own people, that is likely the easiest way.
You never trust what Russian Govt says. Not even the Russians do
One reason for all this... NATO and UN.
Why Americans not helping ☮️
Anyone who condones WAR is a Bloody fool,  there are no winners in war only tragedy and grief.
Its called russian propaganda
where have your hearts been for the past 8 years while western backed fourth reich gangs attacked east ukranians? The BBC are a state funded terrorist cartel!
Z world. :D TV War....distractions from 5th session of the Grand Jury Proceedings.
The whole world apart from the Russians, Chinese and probably North korea
Donbas was under Kiiv bombs for 8 years! So many people were killed by Kiiv troops! So many houses destroyed. Now we feel free, as this mess is over. Zelensky shall answer for all deaths he caused.
@Craig Scott  fourth reich gangs, got to give it to you, your a master at talking shite
 @Craig Scott  mkk
Russia is a nuclear power. They may be the sick man of Europe. But they also have nukes.

I pray that the Armed Forces of Russia secured a swift and decisive victory over these Nazi! Sent them back to the stone age.
It’s deeper then what you think . Ukraine politicians and leaders have made very corrupt deals money laundering and so on Biden family has very bad deals with them eventually giving the corrupt leaders more authoritarian power . Putin is cleaning house it’s now or never . It’s very sad for the innocent either way I pray protection of all family’s with young and old

 @Craig Scott  You are the exact idiot we think you are.
 @Ho Lee Fuk  What do republicans have to do with this?
USA UE stop arming idiots as Bin Laden and Neo-nazis as Azov Battalion
If Putin Swallow Ukraine he will swallow More of European countries and he will become emperor again 🧐Then Russia up 🔼  USA and Europe  down ⬇️ ,😑,
Sea south China?
Adolfimir Putler has to be stopped.Russia disappointed Italy as well.
 @Craig Scott  Spoken like a Putin puppet.
 @Switch Statement  а нас разочаровал ваш мусолини
 @George Cher  are you actually listening to yourself? There shouldn't be any emperors or corrupt leaders. All the people of the world should be FREE and not under control
prayers are not gonna do it.  only force will make this russian hitler think twice!
 @Craig Scott  Ukraine will be nuclear ground of NATO if Ukraine join NATOAlso Ukraine is Part of Russia our mother landPutin have good move to Russian and Ukraine people United in one countyKnow the history first before comment hard here

 @Gerald Thethird  And putin doesn't have does to Russian mafia lol!!!
Where are you in the West, when it comes to the Eastern Mediterranean, you are in the middle when it comes to Syria. Where are you for Ukraine, cowards?
 @Kendra  It isn't a part of Russia. The Russian Empire conquered it. The Ukrainians don't want to get conquered by Russia again.
Speak for yourself, no prayers from me ! The reason...
 @Craig Scott  fake fake fake  These same comments everywhere like fake factory
Poland will be next
NATO put those people in danger by insisting that Ukraine should join NATO.
It’s not their fight, but they did help financially
 @Colin  so why they invaded Afghanistan
 @G Khan  ultimately to hunt down Osama, but I’m sure there were other reasons, good or bad
 @G Khan  I think from a moral standpoint the American should fight beside Ukraine, but unfortunately they have no reason to interfere
 @Colin I think Bush had bad dream for Iraq Libya etc
 @G Khan  you’re not wrong
lets go brandon
If one morning the sun rise at west- it means that Putin's patience reached its limits. :):):)
Why would Putin do this
BEHOLD A PALE HORSE
Harkiev is in the Russian area of the Ukraine! The Russians are hardly bombing their own people! Its probably the Ukrainians bombing them because they want to escalate this war and bring the west into it to help them rid their country of Russians!
vladimir you murderer
my heart breaks for Ukrainemy condolences to the people who lose their livesduring this terrible war
Calling all MERCENARIES around the world to fight with Ukraine.. this evil war freak Hitler in the making PUTIN must be stopped at all cost... ATTENTION ALL MERCENARIES, MILITIAS - - fight this devil PUTIN
If any cute Ukrainian women refugees need somewhere to stay, I've got a pretty nice twin mattress in my mother's basement.
US and NATO cannot be found when you need them the most
thought it would be WW3 with the issues with North Korea, then with Iran, now with Ukrainian.      No difference between us humans and animals always bloody fighting for one reason or another.
Awwwww
USA + UK + France Attack  IRAQ, Afghanistan + Siria ................?? ,,,
As usual, civilians end up paying the price of inflated egos. It is heartbreaking to witness all this and not be able to do anything other than watch. Ukraine, Romania stands with you! If you need to run, do it. Our borders are open to you!
So Russia just bombed what looked like an apartment building?? I’m not saying this is fake but I will say don’t believe everything you see on tv or the Internet. There are forces that actually want a war.
DESTROY USA UN NATO EU 🏴
This has nothing to do with Biden you numbskull

Damn that doesnt relate to the comment I made, I care about life in Ukraine and I said your lying because everyone says the comment like you bombed middle east and you call me terriosts imagine if that happened to you
Your heart is fine, stop lying. You felt sad for like 2 seconds.
https://youtu.be/L0G9WRRWIuM<
There is something you can do, you just don't give that much of a fuck
 @dev stuff  my guy, do something yourself, lazy piece of shit
NATO could send troops, because NATO didn’t mind going to Libya
 @dzimidrol  I'm not educated on the Libya war. Did they have nuclear warheads?
 @dev stuff  I had forgotten that random people on the internet know best. Thank you for reminding me.
The aftermath videos of shelling with children dead in the streets is absolutely heart breaking. Russia will have to pay a heavy price for this.
And to think Nato would help? Keep listening to the USA.
Putin is losing his mind!
Their heart goes out of their body
I blame western leaders for being unable to find the obvious diplomatic solution; Ukrainian neutrality. They should have agreed to Russian terms on Ukraine not joining NATO; none of this would have happened.
The BBC has never told how the armed forces of Ukraine are shelling civilian buildings and civilian infrastructure facilities of cities in Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Why doesn't the BBC tell how Ukrainian ultranationalists attack civilians inside the country? How oligarchs and officials in the Ukrainian government steal millions of dollars allocated to restore the economy and improve the standard of living of citizens of Ukraine. The BBC is silent about this.
This is terrible. I'm praying for the Ukrainian people. 😔
Putin will be next like Saddam
Bush and UK Tony Blair and other Coaliion aimed to disarm Iraq of weapons of Mass destruction in 2003. UN inspection team had already declared it had found absolutely no evidence of them. That's why i'm laughing at the Rhetoric they saying Putin is doing, smh, lol! Oh i forgot about them U.S aiding anti-Gaddafi rebels with air strikes in 2011 with Libya, but OH, that was different!
Ms. Rainsford was expelled from Russia a few months ago, wasn't she? For reporting propaganda.
Daaaaaaaaaaaaaamn I can't believe this is happening 😢 I wonder if they're 
PUTIN is supporting FREEDOM AND THE INDEPENDENCE of Eastern Ukraine.You guys shamelessly support separatists in Taiwan and yet whining about what Putin is doing in the Ukraine. Pathetic.
doesn't matter what they feel.. it's about what's really happening..
This would not have happed had NaTo kept their noses out of Ukraine.Now that it has happened, what is NaTo going to do to help?Was this all planned decades ago? Just like Covid-19? NATO are cowards.Never trust a politician.
Selfish politicians forcing uninvolved civilians to suffer for there own dumb agenda. Fuck putin.
Trumps hero
Who is inheritance of this world?War is not the solution💯remember you are killing your brothes and sisters. Ifelt sad for children who don't know what going on there. Children's are not a solution for the country's problem. They have to live peacefully and everyone should also. Jst stop this!!!
Love bbc propaganda !!!! Let's just ignore the fact that around 4 thousand civilians in Ukraine died at the hands of Ukrainian government these past few years
Where is nato and allied forces? If nato and allied forces no response at all... putin is correct no one can defend ukraine only russia once hold the land
where is the resistance? why aren't anyone fighting back?
The dub during Putin's speech was not correct btw
American people that are commenting here should know that their goverment is directly responsible for this.
😭😌😏😢😥☹️
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
This is worse than covid!
Excuse me, where are NATO and US soldiers? Can anyone see them when their friend being invaded? I quite doubt whether NATO can defend itself.
Go Russia! No NATO expansion! No expansion of American Imperialism and Neo-Liberal world order.
Pls, stop this war ....just pray for Ukraine civilians. 🙏🙏🙏
the ukrainian government bought this on themselves!! i feel bad for the civilians tho
please dont war
🇧🇪❤️🇺🇦
Peace love from India 🇮🇳 🇮🇳 🇮🇳
❤❤❤🇺🇦
Now watch as China invades Taiwan.
All I can say to the Ukrainians is: *LEAVE*, as fast as you can, because within a few weeks this country is a parking lot.
You were warned,
UN ( and US) is like a big bully, they threaten anyone who dares to stand against them with sanctions. What would have US done if Russia armed missiles near its borders.
The U.S. could've stopped this by just not letting ukraine in the nato... And nato isn't even helping...Also anyone remember iraq? Yeah... The U.S. declared war on iraq for now justified reason and many civilians were killed including children... When russians declare war on a country they're the bad guys but when the U.S. does it they're the heroes...
Russians need to stand up and fight the THUGS that control them
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏. Je plais de tout mon coeur le peuple ukrainien. Poutine est un second  Hitler ,un Staline .....😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I think Ukraine is not part of NATO THAT'S WHY
American imperialism? Are you joking?
 @Colin  We have either  invaded or used covert action action against several dozens of countries. We have even went to war under the guise if sending in peacekeepers.
 @Jsledge85  the only imperialist action going on here is Russian imperialism. NATO is only here to provide support to other NATO affiliated countries, granted they’re not doing a very good job
 @Colin  We promised Russia in 1991  that we would never expand membership to ex-communist nations if it would agree to withdrawal its armies and nuclear weapons from bases in Eastern Europe, without exception we broke out word time and time again. Now we have threatened to encircle Russia by granting membership to Ukraine and Georgia, two ex-Soviet republics. Putin does not want NATO troops and nuclear weapons on his front door step. Russians have paid a heavy price from foreign invasions in the twentieth and nineteenth centuries, they are right to not trust NATO’s intentions.
Furthermore, Ukraine has designs to recapture Crimea and Donbas, does it make sense to give  membership to a country that is going to drag you into a major world conflict (over pieces of land that have no importance to average Americans)? No, Russia is doing us a favor…
How did they bring it on themselves?
Dude how about ukraine economy..   don't let the economy stagnate
Yeah where is Nato still talking?
Good time for North Korea to nuke the US. Unfortunately some other countries now will want the US involved. Pray for humanity to overcome 🙏🏻🙏🏻
Hey BBC, would you please interview the Ukrainians who want to be Russian and feel they are being liberated instead of invaded.  I would like to hear the whole story.  Thank you.
Putin is nuts.  Heart goes out to those in Ukraine.  Self defence, who is he kidding.
Where is Nato? Well....... US doesn't support its allies. Blessing to the people there!
Things will get dirty to entire world once NATO and America intefere, as usual.
Np I get Azs on Putin if needed just Shout man
Let world war 3 begin
I can't imagine what it feels like to be part of this. I just hope that somehow, as slim as the chance might be, we could unite and fight it back. The darkest night has fallen upon us. The aggression will never stop unless we act. In some part of the world, people are actually supporting this war. So it is up to the rest of us to find a way to stand with Ukraine, through words, vote or any other form.
where is nato usa  to help us。。。i guess china could help
I wish we would do much more, even full embargo on Russia. I'm personally willing to suffer the price for it. If it comes to that, we can house a family fleeing from the war, with us, we have room for that.It's and Independence day for my country Estonia. And now also the day Ukrainians are in open war, by same rotting little man we were afraid of
That as the warning to US n West millitry to leave Ukraine immediately. Ukraine will be in a long war.... Not save.. Just leave or die or step Down the NATO puppet that lead a country..
Im down 2 go help
Omg💔🙏🏾
The Bible does not lie
Lord protect all people 😭 Stop this war...
I know my words doesn't matter, but I want to put it here that we, all the people of the world, don't want another war. How long will it take for the leaders to learn from history? I, my little country Bangladesh🇧🇩, and all the humanitarian people over the world are strongly against killing people like insects. But again, how much my words matter?!
Come on Ukraine kick Putnin's Ass!!! Fight!! Everyone Fight !!! This is your country!!!
No NATO country dare to involve,  they afraid of being nukes by Russia.
Why don't they just move into Russia then? The same can be said about anyone who despises the country they are in. Lmfao.
https://youtu.be/thADhg3M3yIhttps://youtu.be/thADhg3M3yI
Leave Ukraine asap Putin Dont GAF who he strikes
drop a bom on the kremlin
Dw, nato won’t help you. Best of luck
Where are the US troops that they promised would help ukraine when russia attacks?
I really Admire BBC's way of reporting  , kudos to the reporters on ground zero in Ukraine 🇺🇦 👏  .
What the hell did Putin and Russia have to fear from the Ukraine? They can't even defend themselves from the Russian attack on their own soil let alone attack Russia.
What countries are on the UKS and the American side
Weak americans and mayo dude bullshit
I'm praying for Ukraine God bless 🙏🏽
It’s always the civilians that suffer
It's called being provoked. Ukraine send send tanks passed the Russian border which lead to Russia to launch missiles and Russia began to launch missiles. Ukraine want a war they asked for it. Thank Gorbachev for the years of dispute he gave away Crimeria and donbass to the Ukrainians and this angered the Russians. Look up history of the Soviet collapse and it's post armed conflicts that still occur today.
Anyone that thinks it's a Vladimir and Ukraine war is an ignorant! It's plainly a NATO against Russia, China and North Korea war. This can lead to a WWIII at anytime. Russia has learn from the History. They know they were used fight the Ottoman Empire, and when the Ottoman was defeated, the US, France and England were the one splitting the Muslim Countries among themselves and Russia got a 
Why wont just putin just go on a 1v1 with the president of ukraine. A million people will die at the cost of one man's ambition
As a history YouTuber, this is devastating. People are repeating the same mistakes as history. I hope we can reach a diplomatic solution as fast as possible
PEACE NOT WAR ☮️❤️
This is Ukraine’s problem not ours. We didn’t ask to get involved in this conflict?. It stinks
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾 this is horrible. Praying for both centuries. This is pure evil.
Ukrainian President may surrender now
If you’re in Ukraine take everything valuable and leave
I’m a Russian and I horrified by what Russia is doing and what is happening with the pandemic it’s just so unfair,I’m scared for Ukraine lucky I don’t live in Russia anymore

I remember saying that Russia was full of crazy people five years before any of this happened, and some jackass was like, why would Russia invade any country in Europe? I would love to talk to that jackass right now and say I told you so.
Fuck BBC anyway
F#CK EACH AND EVERY LEADER OF EACH AND EVERY NATION AND GOVERNMENT ON THIS PLANET. THE WORLD IS A SHIT SHOW AND THE LEADERS OF THE WORLD AND THEIR FOLLOWERS ARE RESPONSIBLE.
Bullshit.
The world hates you Putin!!!! Everything u did to Ukrain will return to you very soon!!! GTH!!
Vladimir Hitler. Sergey Göring
It's no good telling them to stay strong, be safe and so on and on. This has been building up since WW2. If it doesn't get stopped now, it never will ‼️
Messed up world we live in
If only original Covid 19 met Putin this world would be a better place and no one helped him.
putin's a bit dumb isn;t he.   i don't think he understands that the world doesn't care if russia exists anymore really due to this.  self defence.  what a joke.  it's like the the uk invading ireland claiming self defence. it makes no sense.  russia is a massive wasteland.       what a pathetic excuse for a human being.  looking forward to watching his hanging video in a few years time.
why the hell is the journalist wearing a bulletproof vest? It's all theatre,but people are going to suffer to cover the end of the plan-demic
Bbc full of shit
Can we trust the BBC's reporting on this? After their blatant Covid and toxic vaccine propaganda for the last 2 years. What's the actual reality of the situation??
Respeck Ukraine
I got scared to the Alarm, sound of the explosions and Birds are desperately flying away, its like there is something bad will happen and yet there it is
Th AngloSaxon world isn't finish yet with the profitloss analysis if it's worth 
This is all “WEAK BRANDON’S FAULT”
The BBC is about as reliable as you can get.
Russia says the attacks are self defense. Who believes that!
Ukraine can end all this just by surrendering!!
Unbelievable that this is happening in 2022.
wtf is wrong with Putin?
This has GONE FAR ENOUGH. The US and EU need to STEP IN NOW. Go to hell pocket-putin.
I always thought Russians have balls of steel but how can anyone who claims to have balls be in the hands of a dictator??? no more respect for these little people. STOP THE WAR. GATHER IN THE STREET AND STOP YOUR DICTATOR
BBC always has agenda
FWYB
World wars 3 rusian chinese korea VS us nato. Who is powerfull in the world?
Hey guys, did you tear up too when the sirens were heard in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and all other middle eastern countries that were invaded by American / Nato forces? Or does this empathy only exists for the west?
All Malaysians stand with Ukraine 🇲🇾
Bless the Ukrainians. My heart is with them. This is upsetting.
A close friend of mine lives in Nikolaev. This is absolutely horrifying to watch.
Fuck Putin
At least the Ukariane nation isn't fleeing like those coward Afghanistan citizens SMH
So  sad 😞
Non sense he is doing what he said why so much doubt, if you sanction him threaten him with missiles at his border. He will simply roll over you. NATO has threatened him enough. Enough is enough and let him settle the score
I’m pretty sure that I’ve seen enough news in the last many years, but I’ve never heard anything about Ukraine being a threat to Russia. What a complete bunch of bullshit. Alllllll of NATO should be aimed directly at Putin.
Stay strong Ukraine soldiers to fight back Russia's troops. Let them to be defeated at last! Victory will be belonged to brave Ukraine soldiers!
Many felt that the statements of the European Union confirm that the goal of Russia's progress is to occupy Ukraine and threaten the rest, and if this is truerWhy don't the Russians kill civilians and destroy only military facilities, and why at this time and not before?rWhat I see analysis is that Russia was insisting on its position that Ukraine did not join, and that it believed when it attacked civilians, and that its demand was clear and clear, which is to protect its land from the presence of NATO in UkrainerOn the other hand, allegations, denial of facts, and unacceptable escalation may be made to be an opportunity for a global war instead of acknowledging the demands, which from everyone’s point of view are normal, and then everything ends and the world lives in peace instead of a war that destroys everyone.rWhere is the diplomacy that always precedes and ends before wars?
Well, you did probably believe that LDNR were under russian occupation and there were russian troops. And there were no shouting from the ukrainian side for 8 years. And no, I don't support Russian or Ukrainian state.
Tamilian

Why Ukraine  need to fight  they already  what is,the best  things to do why they are listening  to U.S
On the one hand Putin insist he's defending his country Russia. On the other, Ukrainians feel attacked and have not declared war on Russia. The West and the U.S. have warned Putin will attack, while Putin said he will not, yet spent time 
Mr. President of Ukraine you didn't listen.
STOP HITLER - STOP PUTIN - STOP EVIL
1:28. In what deluded and deranged world is this defence? This mf just invaded its neighbour who wasn’t even a member of NATO.
Yeah. Thanks for another primitive propaganda, but I have watched russian state television too much not to see so primitive manipulation.  And now, watching russian and american media about this war, I damn tired.7:56 Except this. This is true words of our people.
Putin needs to go straight to hell
We can all thank the US and NATO for this conflict. They wanted Ukraine in NATO, where are the nato soldiers protecting them?
Pray for Ukraine 🇺🇦 🙏🏼
Go Russia 🇷🇺 🐐👁ww3
It show who's have a bad intension,,hey Putin don't forget the bad karma
No more war
So what's wrong with everybody?  Why didn't the politicians guarantee Russia that NATO will not be in Ukraine?  Now there is war and still no NATO in Ukraine.  So what was the point?
Why did Russia attack Ukraine?
I'm confused. Could someone honestly explain to me why Russia said this was defensive when they struck first?
Open city na Po .sa Ukraine so not to destroyed the beautiful city.
Ukrainian president: This is an attack on democracyAlso Ukrainian president: Locks up all of his political opponents and becomes dictator
https://youtu.be/thADhg3M3yIhttps://youtu.be/thADhg3M3yI
Why's Putin bringing up Nazis? That has zero to do with this invasion.
Putin and Trump should brush up on their history as all tyrants die. This is a terrible act of pure evil. Those poor innocent people don't deserve this. Prayers with them all. God speed!
Why did they not lay down explosives to get those tanks as they rolled in?
Good job stupid humans! Nuclear WW3 just started. We’re not too smart after all, the desire of power and money will cause our own extinction you Idiots.
Yes usa stared this
Oh what a pleaseant surprise in comment section... i see you people praying for Ukranian people which is okay me to, but i didnt see you guys praying for exact same reason when NATO was starting AGGRESION on Yugoslavia todays Serbia in 1999s :D NOBODY trust this propaganda no more your BBC lies are old and discovered long time ago :D
Putin was KGB and he's never let go of that; just waiting for his chance. He's trying to turn the clock back. You Must Be Stopped with an unbelievable unilateral Force now or it will be World War 3.
Putin said its self defense? Wtf is wrong with him
Ukraino obyś z tego wyszła...
A lot of lies. Just like babies being pulled out of incubators in Kuwait
Fight in the front line? Hello, there's no front line.
No! Humans can't live in harmony
putin is just another hitler and needs to be gotton rid of
Self defence yeah sure, never herd that Ukrain want's to invade Russia. Just like Hitler lies after lies and then destruktion.
And now all eyes are on Russia and Ukraine. China may launch an attack on Taiwan. Then this will definitely be the beginning of an end.
Ww3 has just begun , let this go down in history as the world or putin repeating world war , this could’ve easily been avoided just by sitting down at a table and calmly discussing matters instead of war or nuclear war!      Putin is the next hitler!
Putin made a fool out of Marcon , he made a fool out of everyone . What will France do , Nothing. He spit on the World and it's leaders and institutions and body's . He made fools out of them . What will Mr. Big Man Marcon do about it nothing. Absolutely nothing.
While the whole world reacts to this tragedy, China is suspiciously taking notes in the background. I swear if they start a war with Taiwan then it's full house. Fucked up world we're living in these days
Where the f is NATO
Kosovo is Srbia🖕

Lord of the lies Putin
Congratulations globalist pigs.
Look at all the bbc reporters there. Absolute bullshit.
I don't think there a more hated nation on Earth than Russians now.Ukrainians would be well advised to keep their eyes on Hungary. Viktor Orban is in Putin's pocket and might stab Ukraine in the back. Hungarian troops are moving to the East, they might have an incursion into Transcarpathia on their mind...
God save our souls
More context:https://youtu.be/JrMiSQAGOS4
Stay strong Ukraine, what has started can entertain many opinions,  but your actions are most important and relevant.  We can only speak.
BBC, DW and Euronews is also state television
I simply dont trust Western media
Why too many advert for serious news not fair
War is bad they are killing their brothers and sisters.  Ukrainian has fallen 😢 . It would be better if Russia would keep diplomatic outcome . Send books not bombs,  send medicine not missiles.
Now isn't Ukraine a terrorist supporting country an does attack Russia with terrorists so why I sc not this talked about
Russia, one of the world's superpowers with quite possibly the second largest military in the world, feels threatened by Ukraine's independence?? What a load of bullshit!Same things can be said about Israel's treatment of the Palestinians.
Someone needs to teach PUTIN a lesson. USA 🇺🇸 finish him!!
Putin has his way...Biden 
Exactly what the Queen wanted that’s for sure. She thinks we don’t know.
Nows the time to go toe to toe with the Russians. NATO and it’s allies should crush them now then move into China
Go to hell Putin
This is almost like what happened in Poland on 1939
Oh I use to think that india is most hated country. Afterall western and middle Eastern media create so much hatred propoganda against that कंटरी(country)
I'm not in favour of any conflict but I'll never take the BBC's word on any of this or any other mainstream outlet.
Putin is is insane he's lost his mind
Oh no. This is bad.
Ukraine was a Western overthrow ! Puppet government !
Stay strong Ukraine. I hope you all stay safe.
Ukraine should surrender to russiaWhat d you think comment ...
what to do... Who comes to Russia with the sword - will die from it. We didn't move our infrastructure towards NATO, but opposite, NATO moves toward us. This is unacceptable and now it is time to rewind back. Russian people don't feel bad about Ukraine and Ukrainians, but you paid your money for the show, so, please enjoy it.
Stay strong people of Ukraine 🇺🇦 The whole world is behind you. We won't let you down! God bless 🙏
Headlines Putin gets assassinated.The world stands up this WW3 and takes all governments down.The citizens of the world don’t hate each other we hate the governments
I  feel sorry for the poor civilians Peace for whole world🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Putin is the most viscious war crimina !!!
West didn't support as much as they did terrist Pkk that attacks Turkia
May God guide and protect everyone in Ukraine 🇺🇦
A lot of lies. Just like babies being pulled out of incubators in Kuwait
Having been in a similar position 23-24 years ago, Kosovo feels the pain of Ukraine like no other. If the west sits by and allows for this, pandoras box will be opened. China will invade Taiwan, Serbia will invade Kosovo and Bosnia, and so on. NATO intervened in Kosovo, after months/years of civilian being killed. Will they wait this long for Ukraine as well?
Trump was correct NATO is useless, countries are not serious
No worries about the email address and I will not be able to get back from work until you have been able to get back in touch again with your boys and I have a TV set for the ride at night
Like your useless prayers helps anyone hahaha, they are as useless as the whole UN and NATO,west is a bunch of hypocrites, go back to your lives and stop pretending you care

Always remember that the republicans support this
Ah, these must be the perfectly normal annual military exercises performed on civillians that we shouldn't be hysterical about...
I remember the horror when 27 NATO countries bombed Serbia in 78 days

Even if they Find Putin and Arrest him, it's still gonna be the view of the Russian politicians.An impression they all have.We have to be careful of the direction and the path way we gonna set.To hurt Russia means hatred will build up in the Russian people for decades to come.Thus we have to be careful of the path we set.Nevertheless, Vladimir Putin shud not continue to be a bully, and kill innocent civilians for no Tangible reason.He can not bully the world.The world has no problem with Putin however.What I want yo see personally, is people living happy and free.The politics between Russia and Ukrainian governments shud not deprive the people of happyness.Thus, Vladimir Putin who has Ukrainian families in Ukraine, shud seek to minimize civilian casualties as best as he can.No agression against any Ukrainian people whilst in Ukraine.Still try to hold some level of dignity.At the very least ....Because we don't understand the language of politics ... We as the international community can only ask for safety & security till things work itself out.SO, TAKE YOUR TIME VLADIMIR.DONT HURT UKRAINIANSAnd That's not what we want.
the 'West'. this will also include those on NATO
First to be taken out is command and control. Then air defense, then navy.  Finally, go after the airports and cut off the leadership at the head.  This will be over in 48 hours.
Leave Ukraine alone please 🙏🏾
How can we believe western medias on war?
Yeah now its self defense and its on mf
You know what else didn’t help the instigating of sending Ukraine weapons & money to fight Russia! This seems like it was pushed to happen!
שה׳ ישמור עליהם.
I also feel bad for those Russians civilians that don’t want war have to go through this
I disagree  with the EU,and AMERICANS,reactions  to this invasion, they are making the same mistakes  that was made in 1939,with HITLERS  invasion  of Poland, Putin  is a dictator, he along makes Russias decisions, he will not be satisfied  with small amounts  of the Ukraine  state,if where to bring sanctions  against Russia than those sanctions  must be meaningful, and not the token sanctions already on the table,ONLY FULL SANCTIONS  WILL DO,A FULL  EMBARGO ON ALL RUSSIANS  IMPORTS WILL DO,its complete economy  should  be strangled,WHY,history  shows us that a poor Russia  is a safe Europe, this will insure that Russia  will not be able to maintain a large military  budget,nor utilize  its military aggressively, additionally, this will insure  that insurgents will have a strong and popular  argument  for the removal and imprisonment  of Putin,just as the German people  where held responsible  for Hitler, the Russians  must be held responsible  for Putin, please remember  China  is analyzing  this situation, it to has land interest aboard, Even without provocation  the means for extreme sanctions  against  China  should  be drawn  up now,History  has taught us that dictators are always hungry for additional  power,and must always be removed via blood.Additionally it must be understood  that sanctions must be brought against  any government  who oppose sanctions  against Russia  or China, and in all cases those sanctions  should  be (STARVATION  SANCTIONS).
It’s sad these people don’t know the country was taken while they slept! They didn’t even put up a fight. Once you loose the air over your country it’s over!
Putin is a war criminal killing innocent people should be held responsible and punished by the NATO.
Ukraine gonna become Syria 🙂🙂💔
Putin what a prat just like Hitler
Praying for Russia to defend there territories  against Americans on their doors
Putin is right but civilized world will not give him security grantees instead they will continue the bullies and support of war criminal Israel. Civilized. This civilized world kill over one million innocent only in Iraq by so called sanctions, Sanctions should be consider as a war crime.
Where is nato are they abandoning the people they may not be dependable in time of war
I think What Russia did, was a pre-emptive attack.Same as sionist Israel and imperialist usa.
Thank you Putin for cleansing Ukraine of the Great Satan!
War sucks..,
This is horrible. A war has started now.
It’s a shame!!Putin believed in the times when there was USSR and it was feared and he is trying to go back and crest the same country; he believes Russia can be the most feared country in the world. He is a bully and a dictator and the b..s that he is feeding the world is unbelievable. People like trump love his kind and that what trump was striving for which is to be just like him.
I’m just here to watch the world burn
I support the Ukraine 🇺🇦 🇺🇸
This is 12 hours old, where is the latest?
Que pena! La locura de un hombre traerá muerte destrucción y sufrimiento! Que horror!
NO SUCH THING AS ATTACKS ON CIVILIAN ..!!!
That's response for sanctions.
What a bunch of propaganda. Disgusting.
Putin. Civillians died. Happy now?
Putin should pull back his troops and end this attack before Nato is forced to use military force. If it gets to that then Russia’s millitary will be obliterated and Putin will be removed for the war crimes that he has commited. The best thing he can do to save his military and himself is to leave Ukraine and end the assault.
Is the whole civilized world really so scared and will do nothing in response?
May God help Ukraine and the people..Christ have mercy!
What is Next??
You can tell stupid ppl by reading their comments. They hav no clue whats really goin on
https://youtu.be/LON2Yf7FH_4
These are videos of Donetsk after Ukrainian shelling LOL
Fear is at its' peak, don't let irrational thoughts and/or fears determine your next move. Ever. No matter the situation or circumstance. You all know how the media works... their goal is to instill fear and they've been incredibly effective. Yes, the situation is bad, but there is  always a solution. The media is working against you, not for you. No matter what side of the political spectrum you're on.
The Ukrainian president had to say no US and EU weapons in my country facing and threatening Moscow. Look now, where is the US and EU? They will and cannot help Ukraine. Ukraine should grow up and don’t stay like a sad kid who don’t want nothing . Grow up Ukraine and make your own choices. But you might be a little late for that now. Because I learned if you don’t make your own choices somebody will make ‘en for you!
USA: We guarantee your security.Ukraine gets invaded.USA: Thoughts and prayers...
Well,its not long till we are back to the stone age..
Where is Ukrainian Army? Have they abandoned their ships like the Afghan Army?
No one wants to be planted in a Communist's mass grave!
No, Putin, you have the choice but you like to be Hilter to invade Ukraine unlawfully. You will pay for what you have done to Ukraine!
Sad.. Innocents sacrificed to a geopolitical game. God save the innocent 🙏🏿
We did it joe
Russians lie I’m shocked
Fake News
Ukraine ain't got no talibans😆😆😆😆
It's funny how he's said that Ukraine was going to attack them
Prayers from Indonesia, my heart aches to watch this. My heart goes to all the Ukranians 😭🇮🇩🇺🇦 Let's not create another Palestine please..
This reminds me of NATO bombing Serbia not long ago, invading Iraq, Syria, Libya....
We have been watching Western 
remember Serbia.fuck NATO
It’s time to purge the communists….
Praying for Ukraine 🥺🥺😭#shame  on you Russia :this is terrorism
Let's go Rússia
If NATO will do nothing in april-mai or in October (the sea gives good condition to invade) more likely China will Attack Taiwan...
No talk about palastine children attacked by israel rocket
Многим в России это кажется каким-то кошмаром. Уже хватали демонстрантов, которые вышли на протестные акции за мир и отмену этой позорной войны.To many in Russia, this seems like some kind of nightmare. Already enough demonstrators who came out to protest for peace and the abolition of this shameful war.
President Biden was 💯 correct on his assessment and told this guy for weeks to be prepare and that the Russian are going to invade. All he did was denied. Now it may be too late.
Only the comman people and and soldiers suffer from both side in wars...
Ukraine President What Are You Doing !!!!
it doesn't sound honest bbc
Three Russian submarines literally sitting off the U.K. coast and the Eastern U.S. !
Blame the US and UK for wanting to surround Russia with NATO supported missiles!   When we have idiots like Joe and Boris in power it's no surprise!
My God!!! No!!! no!!! no!!! Unbelievable!!! War???!!! In this day and age???!!! Boże!!!
War Is Hell.Bless all the casualties.Rest In Peace Sister's and Brother's.
Oh please if they ppl were under attack just the power Russia has it would’ve been wiped out already! Stop the nonsense! We need to rid our world of the war mongers! The EVIL!
Noo

NATO and the European Union are crying in their headquarters at how hopeless they are. They are freaking scared of Russia.Vladamir Putin is the strongest and most powerful leader in the whole world.
If you voted for our current dictator be happy! This is what you voted for...will be a perfect diffusion on what's going in our country.
My heart goes out to Palestinian people who bbc don’t report on
Wait for China to INVADE Taiwan whilst the west is distracted by Russia invading Ukraine....
Bbc fake news...
1:12 let's take a moment to salute and honor the men and women working to put out fires and stop harm instead of enlisting in the military and continuing this cycle of violence like the Russian soldiers invading. They are real heroes. 
Putin needs to calm down. This was totally unnecessary. I hope the sanctions go much further and defensive assistance is provided by all NATO countries. An increasingly expansionist power on the border of Poland is never going to be a good thing - we all know what happened a few years ago…
Gogo Russia! Stay down usa
It’s a good job that Russia are there on a “peacekeeping” mission otherwise who knows what devastation they could unleash.
Study who funds the war machine thats the gollum clan,always busy arent they
Zelenski is americas marionette
Why west playing dirty games to kill people most horrible uk
They should put Putin and Volodymyr in a ring and let them fight like men. Guns kill people. Fight like real men. Dic.khe.ads
Putin is a liar, looked the Nazis going into Poland . well nato, what now ?
War is useless 😪stop please
Hey Biden where are u at?
It’s very sad, but the truth is there’s absolutely nothing anyone can do! If you start throwing bombs at Russia you will start a nuclear war! It’s no different if bombs are thrown at United States or China, the outcome would be the same! The only thing you can do is pray for peace and hope that lives will be spared!
NATO. NATO. NATO.. is nothing and only welcoming human conflicts...killing people...killing humanity...
fears for his job? your a moron for saying that...he's worried and fears for his people...be mind  full with your words
A coup sponsored by usa where legitimate gov was overthrown and pro western puppet installed, which has started all this? Yeah we all know
 @Анатолий К.  what legitimate government? The Soviet Union dissolved and the Ukrainian people overthrew their dictators an democratically voted in their leaders without western influence. The Cold War had ended.

Peace is important ,but european mislead ukrain president
Russia have a right to defend  their country from terrorism. BBC propaganda.
Putin must be jailed
JOE BIDEN IS NOTHING BUT A TWO FACE MONSTER. NO GOOD FOR THE U.S., NO GOOD FOR THE WORLD, LIAR, DECEIVER.
And ppl still saying it is fake
So just propaganda. Showing us practice alarms. We all know what war looks like, eemember iraq and Afghanistan? We fn do. This is pure propoganda by the cowards in a coutry of stolen land from surroundingcountries. Bye bye Banderas 👋 🖕
The whole nations is under chaos because of a few people.. if they want war.. let the leaders face to each other and perform duel.. dont let the normal people suffer..Guys we dont need a leader.. without a political leader peace and harmony is available
05:20 he believe in Ukrainian army... poor jerk living in a broken country full of corruption
Didn’t Joe Biden say he was gonna be tough on Putin unlike trump but he’s only putting economic pressure what a loser
I don't know who is right or wrong but by killing people is not a from human mind. He  who inspire yo kill are demon possess.
F for the Ukraine
People are praying for Ukraine but were not praying for Afghanistan,Iraq,Libya and the rest who were bombed by America and nato for false allegations so maybe Russias concerns are genuine,and the west is lying as usual.
This is sad. The West should have listened to russias concerns on nato membership of former Soviet states. Just imagine the destruction.
Where is NATO and EU?...Ukraine is left to defend by itself....
meanwhile illegals flood into the usa.
World War III is now imminent and this does not look good for the world. Plan to make reparations with family members that you no longer talk to, forgive.
This isn’t self defence this force if was that scared he should of just put up defences not invade a country very sad
Didn't we do this to ghadafi and broadcast on national television?
We human race is the worst creation of the Almighty !
Right so Putin has said that they were under attack by Ukraine. Well my question is why has it taken u this long (8 years) to decide an excuse to attack Ukraine. And the reason they are using jets more than troops is because he is a coward and Ukrainian troops would thump them. My heart goes to Ukraine ,🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇺🇦
Go russia  im with you
May the wisdom overcome  the  destruction ...before the powerconsumemankind .. 🕉️🕉️🕉️
Don't you guys worry the gilf lover Macron will sort this one out. lol EU making fun and ignoring US will soon come to a stop ... at a price of course. 🤫

anti Russian anti putin
So unnecessary. So archaic. So sad and disappointing. It breaks my heart.
Fight back
World is crying for ukrarinan people but they had not protested when Americans were bombing civilian in iraq Afghanistan and Syria because they were Muslims shame on UNO and Americans allies which are puppet of America
Where are the so called Americana
I hope the rest of the world gets involved. Putin needs ending. Bang out of order. Scumbag.
The World said there will never be another 
This is what you get when you permit mentally ill people to rule the world. Get rid of those psychopaths and peace will reign, simple as that.
This news is so heartbreaking.
Ukraine should have kept its mouth shut following the collapse of the Soviet Union and remained neutral. Intimidating the tiger next door is no way to go.
Where full speech of Putin. Why it's happened? Just tell True! Don't Lie!
Will we ever stop killing each other for trivial reasons? The people dont want this and this is why the people should control their govenments.
Evil empire
Wtf did Ukraine ever do to Russia ? Tf
Oh you are arab

What a disgusting man Putin is. May he reap what he sow.
Well done  Putin💪🏻 It's enough American imperialism
Even Russian civilians don’t want this! This event will heavily affect Putin’s control negatively
TAKE PUTIN DOWN. This is devastating 😭
You can see that in the concentration camp.rPalestinian kindergartens are on fire!
Nato antagonized russia and got what it wanted. This was the plan LOL
Hit first hit fast & hit hard! Russia 🇷🇺 🪆 🇷🇺
Shows you that EU and NATO is nothing, they will take Ukraine and nobody will intervene. Every country is on their own, don't be fooled thinking they will help or protect you.
Reminds me of the American attack on Iraqi

Obama & Biden are responsible for this.They went in to Ukraine an placed an illegal government in 2014.Let's not forget the truth.
THROW MOLTAV BOMBS on those MFrs   F Russia
Why do the powerful attack powerless? Do we become hero when we attack and suppress the poor? Let peace reign... It will affects the civilians and soldiers and the leaders who stay warm and cozy inside the house feasting and celebrating.
This is a barbaric act
Why don't the Ukrainians stop whinging and just concentrate on helping Boris Johnson avoid any ongoing investigation into his ethics and honesty. I'm sure we all agree his career is more important.
Ukraine thought USA will come in support..
They better DeNazify Russia well before they tackle Ukraine.    Unfortunately,  the world faces the greatest global totalitarian communist threat since the rise of Hitler !!!   😡 😡 😡
They are helping ukraine like america helped iraq and....
This media is horrible
I think if NATO dosnt engage Russia, many people from other countries will come and fight for ukrainian army
Damm as I go through the video I can hear Im heart beating louder and louder in every passing second even though Im more than a thousand kilometres away I can still feel the fear inside my chest. I was not expecting this from Russia I thought it was just show of force but now Im witnessing biggest reason for starting WWIII😢
I wonder about the resolve of the Russian soldiers if resistance is lasting.
Forget covid
If recent history is anything to go by, don't believe the narrative BCC are peddling. They are just as complacent as Putin. Including many other western media outlets!
IS THIS ENTERTAINING ENOUGH FOR YOU ALL !!!
Congratulations to russia. They worned usa but they kept on confroting russia by adding soviet territory to Nato
1. While there had been tensions between Russia and Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, for a long time, the situation began getting out of control in early 2021. In January last year, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged US President Joe Biden to let Ukraine join NATO.2. This angered Russia, which started sending troops near its Ukraine border for 
Welp I guess Ukraine is going down
all these years of progress and 
those who stays calm and stay..... won't be able to leave
I don't like how they hitting broke people.their not even hitting gov. Smh i hate this kind of leaders my blood boils
War never solved any problem, war created problems and continues to do so! Do not fight ,talk and find a solution.
Not necessarily. The next decisions by NATO and the U.S will be really important. For now everyone needs to make moves cautiously and Ukraine may have to fight. I pray for all the innocents involved in this madness
It's mostly correct. Only the NATO membership for Ukraine and Georgia was decided on the NATO conference in Bukarest in 2008. Russia immediately expressed its objections and the membership was stalled. In 2013 Ukraine was lured by the EU with an EU association treaty that the Ukrainian president wouldn't sign. That was the reason why the pro-Western part of the population toppled the government with Western support in February 2014, while an uprising of those opposed to the new government was quenched by armed forces. Russia accepted Crimea's application to join Russia after a referendum was held there. There also was a similar referendum for independence in Donbas. Russia did not recognize the independence of Donbas until last week but all the time since 2014 Donbas has been fending off the Ukrainian army, possibly with some indirect military support from Russia and possibly also helped directly on a number of occasions. Last week the Donbas republics officially applied for military help from Russia against the Ukrainian army who would not stop hostilities even in view of the new agreements between Donbas and Russia.
It’s precisely the ‘progress’ that is the problem. The West was busy gazing at its navel, worrying about things like black representation and pronouns. Poootin saw his moment.
oil and natural gas, what else
What a mind job, first uncle sam builds military installation close to Russian border then the same uncle sam offers military assistance, you could not make this up what did the world expected, you poke the bear with all the military bases then make it out it is all Mr Putins fault, not in my book the real threat is our buddies across the pond whom no doubt our Government will stand shoulder to shoulder.
i hate that most of the bulgarians are for russia i am bulgarian too but i think the nato is better i dont find it good people to like the guy who wnat to make war for one country that want to be in nato i just hope most of the bulgarian finaly listen and to learn that just because some one was kind to them in the past dosent mean the same for the future
Entitlement mentality issues 🤍🗽💎🛶🤡🌬🎭💎🌪
Every country amarica & UK Put hand getting destroyed 🥲
Ukraine provocation Russia since like 8 years,now is pay time come!
NATO should have stopped at the Eastern Bloc. By expanding into a buffer state such as Ukraine is, by all criteria, an insult. There should be no wars between Western and Eastern states. And the only reason we have been living in peace so far is due to the existence of these buffer neutral states. When you have two opposite, highly polarised countries sharing their borders, it's not a matter of if but a matter of when before we face another world war. And to prevent that, we should prevent Ukraine from joining NATO. It's nor fair, I know. But it's the only way should we seek to live in peace for long.
So I guess we're just gonna watch it unfold what's the point of having NATO if they just gonna watch a helpless country Ukraine doesn't have a big enough army to defend itself against Russia
Your country is done. Best get out while you can.
Look at man under the influence of evil. Repentance is needed or you will be condemned of sin.
It's funny how we don't see usa anywhere now.
This is 1% of what happened to middle east people and no one cares hope ukraine find a solution before is too late
If every person stood in the streets and looked at the skies, do you think he would kill innocent people in that way

NATO should be held responsible for this war.
Comment section is full of paid throlls
God bless RUSSIA!! 🙏🇷🇺 Full support for Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin!
this just breaks my heart
This ain't our problem they shoulda joined NATO, fuck em.
Why did NATO have to expand? Despite promising Russia that they would not.
Point of NATO is to join it and Ukraine still refuses to join it, so I guess their not receiving boots on the ground support till then.
Look another waste of oxygen!
Complacency and compliance are equal to complicity.
If u (Russia) have issues with the Ukrainian military,pls just attack the military base. It's so heartbreaking if u attack civilians, there are so many kids and people who shouldn't be affected by this war 😭😭
Putin is just a disgrace to humanity..
whatever the politics is, so unjust to include all these innocent civilians who couldn't give a damn what the quarrel between the governments are
The mighty Russian army will thrash and burn Ukraine to ashes and there's nothing US and NATO can do about it....long live President Putin!!!!
Down with nato
nazi ukraine is getting disciplined
what are you guys sayimg we need to fight
Like why bro some people are so behind in the evolutionary chain . This is straight up caveman behaviour
So by Putins logic of self defence if they capture Ukraine and absorbs the country, doesn't that mean any other country with the ability to launch attacks now  is likely to be attacked for simply having the ability to 
So where does NATO military and where is Ukraine military at?

There were other options than this military operation. There were Minsk agreements that Ukraine had signed. But with the help of the USA, the situation turned into war.
Ukraine is the largest country that spit from Russia during the fall of the Soviet Union. If Russia takes Ukraine...it's likely they will be able to take back any other territory they lost. Putin is now capable of reaching what he has always wanted, a Russia comparable in power to the Soviet era.
Putin: but I love you.Girl: we are from different countries, we aren't the same. Putin: okay.... *proceeds to merge her country with Russia*
Zelensky asking NATO to close the Ukrainian airspace to the Russian airforce proves how delusional he is, which is exactly what led to that invasion in the first place.
Biden, 
Two weeks of 
Acompañamos a todos nuestros hermanos Ucranianos  ante esta terrible terrible locura de un hombre ! Lo siento mucho , que horror, unidos en oración
The older these narcissistic men become the more violent.
Yall are not sorry for the Ukrainian because when the UK and the US was trying to help the country yall were saying the UK and the US are making the war worst like bruhh
russian doing a good job
This is Absolutely Terrible, I hope Everyone in Ukraine Stays Safe
The Ukrainians president listened to the west war machine, now his people are paying the price. Giving the sad, psychotic west something to feel good about
Thoughts and prayers
HIs end will probably be the same as Stalins
Russia always keeps its promise. Where is nato and usa now? Begging whole world to condemn?
Zelensky the traitor
This is a case of a tank afraid of a mousetrap.  Yet Putin says Russia is afraid for its security, that they cannot exist, living in fear of the mousetrap.  So Russia reacts as they usually do.  Notice, they are bombarding and shelling civilian infrastructure and housing as well as military targets.

Very sad, Puttin is a modern day Napoleon. He is trying to prove he is stronger than he really is. America and Nato could easily destore Russia but we are better than that. No one wins in War!
War is really childish it's leaders playing reality computer games they all need to grow the fuck up and get a job

FAKE
Putin is blatantly trying to justify the invasion to west. Im glad no one is buying it. It feels like hes trying to reform the soviet union.
I'm shocked to the core, this could actually be the start of ww3.I can't imagine nato and allies sitting by and watching this without some kind of troops to help
Where is NATO army hiding or was it just a farce.
As soon as Biden was elected a plan to invade started. Its not Americas war but we could have stopped it. God bless theses people.
Fxck  Putin
So evil, that Voldem*rt Putin...
Targeting key military locations
davaj davaj
This is the worst mistake Putin could have ever done. Nato will stop him and hopefully many more innocent people won’t have to lose their lives. I am very sorry for the Ukrainian people. I’m also sorry for the innocent russian people who are being dragged into this act of aggression that their leaders have commenced. Unfortunately the Russian people will lose the most out of this conflict as Russian leaders cannot hope to win in any regard. This is an act of insecurity on Putin’s part and will not work in his favor. I hope the Ukranian people cam keep safe and endure this horrible set of circumstances.
He's probably the devil .i never seen him around women u know ?
i just hope casualties don't reach even 1% of world war 2 deaths
Afghanistan, Myanmar, now this ....This sends the message that the bad guys can do whatever they want and the rest of the world can't really do anything about it...
No matter what Putin says, this is going to escalate to the degree that mothers ,sons , daughters and fathers will be killed by the Russian federation. We have sat back and watched Putin lie over and over. His government was directly responsible for blowing up a passenger airliner MH17 killing all on board. Regardless of little Hitlers lies He’s not fighting nice and he has no intention of stopping with Ukraine. After he conquers that territory he will move on to NATO territories. Regardless of Putin’s threats of nuclear war he must be engaged military and Ukraine must be given the means to kill their enemy. His country is at risk of radioactive contamination as well so we can not back down from his aggression.
Shameful

Adolf Hitler used exact same excuses in 1939 to attack Poland.  History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes.
https://youtu.be/thADhg3M3yI
Agreed. It is the same reason why UK manage to hold out against the German in ww2

Philippines here, island country is really an advantage.
Depends on the neighbours.
That’s what you might think, wait till China is on your doorstep.
Lucky you, you will probably be fine even if nuclear war breaks out...
 @oojikarasuma1  Precisely. It's honestly quite shocking when you look at the border history of European nations.
Shush, no need to remind the whole world that NZ exists. That's where I plan to retreat if things get dicey.

I don’t know what to think but I’m so worried about a war starting anytime soon. Sanctions against Russia are being set around the world and rightfully so, but this clearly isn’t enough to stop Putins invasions or successfully defend Ukraine. Ukraine is a small country and they will need a lot more help and support and imposing sanctions on Russia definitely won’t be effective enough to combat this.I think it’s only a matter of time before some countries will be so moved and feel so compelled to jump in and declare war to defend the people of Ukraine. But I really don’t want to see that. If either a European country or America declares war, more will follow through and as soon as that happens, WWIII has started.
@X X  yeah I think Russia knows full well that sanctions would follow so they won't work, unfortunately. Only troops sent in to help Ukraine would help but that's scary as shit
Putin needs chemical castration or somethingToo high testosterone or too insecure of his dick or something
Where is NATO USA
This reminds me of Iraq
why dont the rest of the world just invade russia now, all their forces are on their west side.
World should unite to stop this modern day Hitler.
Typical beast bbc coverage i feel for the Ukrainian people if the rest of the world kept their noses out they would off had a better chance joe biden and boris Johnson have just pushed us closer to ww3 why would anyone beleive the mainstream after the lies they have told over the last two yrs im very suprised the bbc have their comment section open after they shut down comments on covid 😳🙄
Putin is right. If you listen to Russian media it becomes very clear that the US are the transgressors of international terms, as usual. But western media, as usual, do a much better job in brainwashing the masses.
NATO can bomb Russia right now. Surprise attack  while all their troops are where we can smash them.
A part of me thought.. surely he wouldnt attack Ukraines mainland ..So sad...
ohhhh God These Leaders dont satisfied themselves by killing of Covid Bio Warfare???? they wants to kiiiillll more????
how can you feel bad for ukrainian people if u didnt feel for PALESTINIANS IRAQIS SYRIANS AFGHANIS LIBYANS etc .......GO RUSSIA GO SHOW THIS PUPPET NATION WHOS THE BOSS THERE
Shame on you putin, you will be written as the successor of hitler,musolini, stalin
Praying for Ukraine ❤️❤️🙏🙏🙏
Yea he said he had no plane's to invade yet we still stuck sanctions on him?
If people can remember most of US citizens were against Iraq war but yet Bush govt invaded Iraq and totally destroyed Iraq. This is a returning of the time when world power will be balance. No more US dominance and no more NATO aggression. Ukrainian govt called them democratic country but their president still sends his opposition leader to jail and shut down 3 TV station that telecasting news against Ukraine president. Yeah so much for democracy
This is disgusting. Russia is horrible for Doing this
How bout threats from USA. The white nationalist nazi movement is America.
Go on Russia....Russia's  rights to defend it self
Because no sense russia wants safety from nati

Good that you understand
Nice move, employ a Black journalist to talk about non Nazism in Ukraine.
BBC has no creditability. It's just another propaganda machine for the English government. Peace & stay safe people!
Self defense you idiot you attacked with out being provoked !!!
Ah yes self defense killing 10s of civilians just to prove his point
Russia if you need to power,not to killing others and not to destroy others.You need to build more technology like phone,car and others public needed to grow your economy and to help peoples around the world. Putin, you are wrong thinking.If you believe god,don't you try wars. You will get back badly.
All this could be prevented but western politicians chose not to
Politicians are the problem.
Sending prayers for all of the people will gonna be affected of this horrible attack.
This guy needs to be replaced militarily
NOW is the time to economically and politically isolate Russia as much as humanly possible!!! We need hit them EXTREMELY HARD economically!!!If we can get the majority of the other G8 and G20 members to commit to similar (or the same) sanctions isolating Russia politically and economically that would send a very loud message (I doubt that China would play along, but the other G8/G20 countries might) and if that works, then maybe we can work on the getting other countries in the UN General Assembly to follow suit in isolating Russian even more…Kick them out of as much international banks as possible Block ALL exports from US, EU, and NATO members to Belarus and RussiaBlock ALL imports from Belarus and Russia to US, EU, and NATO membersBlock ALL flights from Belarus and Russia to US, EU, and NATO members Block ALL flights to Belarus and Russia from US, EU, and NATO members Close ALL land borders with Belarus and Russia and NATO membersDeny Belarusian and Russian flights (and ships) from traveling through US, EU, and NATO members territorial air space (and territorial waters) Expel ALL Russian Embassy and Consulate staff and close ALL Belarusian and Russian Embassies and Consulates in the US, EU, and NATO member countriesThe ONLY way the sanctions should be lifted is AFTER they end all support for separatists in Georgia 🇬🇪 , Moldova 🇲🇩 , and Ukraine 🇺🇦 and withdraw all forces in Georgia 🇬🇪 , Moldova 🇲🇩 , Ukraine 🇺🇦 (including Crimea)In short, we should stand strong with our friends and allies 🤝 by telling Russia to go f**k🖕themselves!!!! Because, if Ukraine 🇺🇦 falls, Moldova 🇲🇩 and Georgia 🇬🇪 will be next!!!!
And when Russia warned no one give a damn Now deal with.
holy fuck
Thanks for brave journalists for reporting updated news to us. Keep alert and safe from the danger! God bless you all! Save the Ukrainians!😭😭😭
Lies lies lies, read and research widely my friends
🖕 Russia

Don’t instigate the resistance and you won’t receive blows western clowns.
Where are the defenses???
Is ukraiane really part of Russia.? 🙄
My condolences go out to any Ukrainians 🇺🇦 who have lost their lives.
In war accidents happen often
Yes they provoking russia
 @Yuri Mikhailov  Exactly, Putin gave them several opportunities to find peaceful, diplomatic solutions to all this but they refused to act.

https://youtu.be/L0G9WRRWIuM
Peace will never come as long as Ukraine join NATO FORCE .How would USA feel if Russia starts to join forces with USA Neighbours ???I don't understand why USA/NATO had to build defensive forces on Russia Neighbouring Countries .Face the consequence now 🤦
https://youtube.com/shorts/eCgMVNeko9g?feature=share🙂👆
 @zoro zoro  they are not in NATO
 @Stefan Vasilache  They were about to join NATO so Russia gave a strong response 👍
 @zoro zoro  did ukraine joins nato?
https://youtu.be/lo6ZCiUZ3Ew
 @zoro zoro  not true, stop the lies of the fake regime
 @zoro zoro  How would the USA feel if Russia joined forces with USA neighbors? ....uhhh if the USA was attacking Canada/Mexico unprovoked and Russia tried to intervene? I would think that’s a pretty justified response from Russia especially if they owed Canada/Mexico protection. The US has promised protection to Ukraine since they handed over their nuclear arsenal. The US is also the figurehead of democracy in the world so it’s their obligation to take a stand against the blatant injustice in which Russia invaded Ukraine. You don’t understand why USA/NATO helped Ukraine build defenses in case of an unprovoked attack from Russia, (an extremely dangerous country that’s been trying to retake Ukraine since 2014)? Is that not what just happened?.....
 @zoro zoro  Their strong response: BOMBING RANDOM INNOCENT PEOPLE
 @Aerth  USA has killed more innocent people in the world compared to Russia or any other countries .🤦
 @zoro zoro  doesn't make it right you dumb melon.
 @David C.  This is not about the USA.It's a situation straight out of the History books.The times of Imperialism and it's practices should have been long gone, but Putin wants to bring back all of that.Nevertheless, he also actively lied to and threatened all the others nations in case of interference of any kind.
Looks like they need some well-placed rocket launchers, where is the Ukraine army returning fire? Nobody is hitting that column of tanks?
Putin will win.  God is on his side.
Wow thats terrible.So please help them with your army,with your guns,not only with your mouth,lol
Prayers for Ukraine and rest of the world. Looks like the start of ww3 to me smh
God bless Ukraine, I hope they show Commisar Putin just how costly being an international gangster is. It hurts my heart, but I hope those Neo-Soviets get their ass stomped and are removed from their permanent Security Council position
🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
The gentlemen covering news correspondence from Ukraine is not cowering in a bunker.Everyone can see that the situation is serious in Ukraine, my heart goes out to everyone in Ukraine I hope,  it is not all out war as the western media are hyping it to be....
These are the leaders of our world people! We allow this to happen to our world? Our planet? Humanity? The world needs to stand up & remove ANY LEADERS creating war, instigating war or even speaking of it! This is OUR PLANET! We let these idiot leaders destroy it & its people! These are the Evil we are letting oppress humanity with their GARBAGE!
All we can do is pray for them from our home
DOWN WITH THE NWO!!! RID THE WORLD OF FASCISTS!
Please, help us
Stop feeling sorry for the people of Ukraine , and demand your governments to do something. Western powers have allowed this to happen, they have sat a back for decades. Sanction Russia, Putin and his minions now, and in every way possible.
Stop war
So the world 🌎 🌍 is going to sit and watch this🙄wtf….
Zelenskyy is a natzi zionist Jew. Why he wants to distroy Ukraine? It's a mistake that this guy been elected a president in a foreign country.
Bias, bias, lies, deceit and propaganda the national and international identity of BBC. #ShameBBC
The only ones who can stop putin are the people of Russia.
The greed of this man.. He started the war and he is acting the victim.. This is horrible... May God be with them💗🙏 God Save Ukraine
Wtf why we even have to fight each other again please stop 🛑
Im not religious, but pray for Ukraine. Its the most we can do.
Thanks Russia for doing this in winter. Children will freeze to death.
Lol love the narrative of the west. There is 0 talk about how America and Ukraine could’ve avoided this only if they didn’t poke at Russia by inviting Ukraine to nato and Ukraine agreeing. It’s like asking for war and now that it’s here you all act like you’re innocent. Citizens could’ve chose to protest when they found out that their leadership is trying to join Russians enemy number 1.  Instead they say there and accepted it too. They asked for this. As much right as they have, to join nato. They simply can’t! They’re sharing border with Russia and Russia doesn’t Want nato next to them. Do you think America would allow Russia to chill by their doorstep? No one talks about this though.. surprise surprise
Time for us and nato stop using ukraine as pawn.
Civilians are dying. Poetin is a war criminal. He must pay for his crimes.
The western nations need to stand up for Ukraine.
Ya cause Ukraine is so threatening they never shot once so here comes the pasty Russians. We’re coming in because we’re scared 😱
They're not telling you that Ukraine's president imprisoned his opposing party and shut off the water having people thirst to death near the border of Russia and the crops are failing
I’m from Myanmar 🇲🇲 We all are in the same condition 😭We stand with you, Ukrainian and praying to safe you all. We all want freedom and Democracy for our future 🥺
What type of bullshit question is that? 
We will fight Ruscists occupants viciously!
Where are the dead bodies?
Thanks america and west europe for this dont play the victim u clowns
We have to stop appeasing them. This is vile, the Kremlin should be ashamed of themselves and the west needs to do something united. No regard for lives, my heart breaks💔
Oh its Surgical all right
What can America do to help?
We stand with Russia 🇷🇺 Pakistan 🇵🇰 😀
Mnyanmar want democracy yet vote slutty, hypocrite, corrupt san suu kyi as president

Freedom and democracy are what led to current state in Ukraine. At times, Loki could be right. 😔.
Prayers for you and your family as well!! My best friend has family in Myanmar and they had to flee to India , I wish we just had peace for everyone🤍🤍🙏
 @ɴᴏʀᴛʜᴇʀɴ ʀɪᴠᴇʀ  you now there's genocide going on there right? Tf is wrong with you?
Democracy is dead a long time ago my friends..Wake up!
🇮🇳❤️🇷🇺
Biden....... First Afganistan now Ukraine, which country do you want to destroy next?
There is 2 ending to this all out war with russia and china or russia and china take world dominance..
USA dissolved NATO so that it could be the main fighting force. Turns out American military is good at one thing, costing tax payers trillions.
Doesn't Ukraine have an army 🤷🏾‍♂️???????????????????
As a Dane this will never be forgotten! We’re all in terrible shock. I would have wished Ukraine was allowed to join NATO. We will never respect Russia with Putin as an evil warmongering dictator!
The only reason for this war is USA and there expansion policies
You better hope this doesn't cause a chain reaction in Europe this could become what you can figure this out what is a chain reaction figure it out
Blame Putin of course, nato is 
western narative of ukrain russia war ...
Ukraine once again pls think the humanity!.. Don't listen to the so called who pretend to be alliance NaTo!.. Pls think the Ukrainian people and the whole world not a pride!.. Because this war have no direction there's no winner on this war all are loosers !...
Glory to Ukraine
S0S
where is NATO now?
Turn the hole country into Dresden  the only way theyunderstand send them home
US remember the Alamo.Russia has a similar War Cry..Remember Alaska.
This is Russian Blitzkrieg and Putin has become the new Hitler. He is now a war criminal. Rather than building a new Russian empire, he has put the Russian federation on the path to disintegration.Putin is an untrustworthy  liar, and that will not have gone unnoticed by his allies, such as China. He is losing access to western markets, thus the laws of supply and demand will cut the price Russian can ask for Russian products. He maybe banking on selling Russian gas to Asia, but it will not command the same price. By attempting to reintegrate former Soviet  satellites states into Russian  against their will is creating a power keg of resentment. Putin will find it very hard to herd these countries together.
Russia is a traitor and a threat to the world!
Clearly the guy don't care about sanctions
🇺🇦
Putin Is the man, but war is never the answer.....except if its iraq,Afghanistan or any other country the United kingdom and United States have attacked!!
Poke poke! Oh bears don't like to be poked hmm maybe we shouldn't have poked Russia for the last at least 5 years.... hoping for the best but I do think that the constant pressure from the west is at fault... peace people better make some deals...
Save ukraine....child and oldage careful
YALL THOUGHT HE WAS BLUFFING HUH
You sneak into russia and kill russian
I fill bad for Ukraine bc one of those big bomb if it hits Ukraine than that's the end for Ukraine
If none of y’all believe in god, who are you praying to?
Me watching this as a half Russia half Ukrainian 😅
Putin is not Russia. Russia is not Putin.
Putin is no joke ☠️
THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF THE END
In War no one will WIN THE BATTLEI HOPE THAT WORLD WAR III will never come NEVER
Can't the Ukrainians invite NATO soldiers into their country and allow them to stop Russia?
If only kings, fought their own wars. Leadership of a nation should never be in the hands of a single person.
Omg I can't.  I hope Putin stop. 🙏
Lol if these weren't wyt ppl what would the reaction be
We the people want this to stop. Our governaments must do something.
This is easy for the USA to stop.  Although the Democrats running the US have neither the brains nor guts to do it.&

Big excuse from putin he just wants to bring ussr back ps fuck you putin
Next is Taiwan
Kick some commie butt Ukraine! You got this!
Russians should have done something about their dictator before this if they were against him.  Putin's war should have started there.
Ok, let's put it this way... if Ukraine become a NATO member America can put it's nukes/weapons/influence  on Ukraine,  on the very doorstep of Russia that is why Russia is doing this to avoid the Cuban Missile Crisis but in reverse. The west is always using media to manipulate the ordinary citizens.  America and Europe aren't stupid they know the new treat won't be coming from the caveman in the middle east it's now from Russia and China.
Rule ,law , negotiation, and agreement never exist .its only power exist.
Pandemic still going onPoor is getting poorer Yet Russia wants to start war for what?More lives needs to be in peace !not R.I.P
Wonder if all wars Britain 🇬🇧 gave countries all over the world, were a people’s war!
The British news service succeeds in misinforming its listeners. The BBC never reflects the two sides of a crisis. Reflects only the anti-Russian point of view.
What the hell is Putin even saying?? De Nazificaton. Their president is Jewish for f sake.
Communists will always terrorized people when they don't get what they want.  My country Myanmar has suffered for so long and the worst happened in 2021 that Military Detractors killed over a thousand of innocent civilians. Since then we are in civil war.
Let’s get Putin put down
Long live putin. Do not forget the warcrimes of the USA. Do you research. remember the Cuban crisis ?
PUTIN = DEVIL OF SON
Canada has dumped millions of dollars in Ukrainian an attack on Ukrainian is an attack on Canada
hit America
This is easy for the USA to stop.  Although the Democrats running the US have neither the brains nor guts to do it.

De-Nazify? Putin forgets that Ukraines president is jewish
Typical Narcissistic behaviour Victim Blaming! Smear campaign on Ukraine. Be brave Ukraine and know that everyone all around the world is rooting for Ukraine 🇺🇦 🇮🇪
Again its the russians who's going to save us from the nazis.Love for russia❤️❤️❤️
China next
They are all Russians and they love to fight.  Stalin exterminated the population of the Ukraine and replaced them with Russians.  About six million starved to death.
Read through this thread, 7,039 posts a time of writing. NOBODY supports what Putin is doing....except Putin and a few trolls on social media. All Ukraine allies MUST do everything to help them...NOW. Weapons, food, fuel, finance, medicine.....NOW.
Russia has learned this barbarism fron UK & USA governments.
If America goes for war it goes with NATO but if russia goes for war then it goes after NATO.Here America is super power only till russia opens its wings. Once it does American army will be seen only in America.
The New World Order propaganda. Russia cleaning Ukraine from the fascists installed by the US.
there are so many hypocrites in this comment section when Americans where bombing Afghanistan iraq syria somalia yemen no one was saying a single word but now u have problem
I know this is bound to happen it's going to get worse he's going to drop more missiles around the capitol.
Dont warry. Soon Russians force to surrender ukranian army. And everyone goes home. We dont war with civilians.
It was bound to become hot at some point.
Translation of Putin's speech is not complete. Words are ripped of context
Are you for Ukraine or Russia? Why?
Save Ukraine🇺🇦
I hope I was wrong, but sadly I am not. People are suffering now. And NATO and US are not there to save them. They were quick to take nukes from them, however.There is still time for Ukrainians to surrender, they are not from a warrior race like Afghans, who can fight for 20-40 years non-stop. In this case its the same culture and religion too, so even less incentive and motivation to resist. The sooner they surrender, the better is the chance to strike a deal with Moscow which will give them some level of autonomy...
PUERTO RICO
I've lost quite a good number of coins in the current dip,I Just hope I find a way to recover from such a massive loss.
Go Putin, anschluss Ukraine into Greater Slavia.
USA provoked Russia. Its The USAs fault. America should be paying reparations to every country on earth.
De Nazification
The Ukraine and the allies should have hit the russians as soon as they crossed the border.
Freaking Putin, I knew his going to attack.  China will do the same.  Never ever trust this countries or you will pay dearly later.  Be safe Ukraine Love from South Korea.  During Korean War, China and Russia help North Korea to invade South.  This countries will not stop until suck you dry a like 1000 years old mummy.
It's good to live with your nabers with out betrayal for some  distance country I think Ukraine learn in hard way
Nazi russia !!! Anyone with a brain in their head doesn't want war!!!
Hitler also  pretended as the Messiah of the Germans.  Russia,  now  Putin is replacing Hitler.  He is not your Messiah  but an Antichrist for you. So come to your senses and  protest against his aggression.
De-nazification? WTF is this guy talking about? It is total non-sense and only an excuse to do what he has always wanted, to ANNEX Ukraine back to the USSR. That has been his obsession all along.
Bless the Ukraine.
I'm a Japanese high school student. I'm not good at writing and speaking English, so I'm using a translation app. Please understand even if the sentence is strange. I'm in Japan, Asia, and geographically very far away, but I'm heartbroken that there are victims of citizens and soldiers in both Ukraine and Russia. There's nothing to benefit from a war. There is nothing to make future generations happy at the expense. All that remains is sadness and hatred. That's obvious after repeated conflicts in human history so far. It's a beautiful thing for 
:(
The amount of times and hardwork has been put by people's of Ukraine building airport being destroyed in blink of eyes my hearty condolences to people's who lost their precious love one's🍀
My heart breaks out for army members on both side😥they have too families kids parents siblings god😭
Its horrific and sad to see all this unfolding before our eyes...just became of two egoistic leaders who won't back down.
Ukraine can't fight with Russia please don't push Ukraine people to die. please stop this war nonsense.

I know it’s a crazy thing to think about, but do you think the US gonna start drafting like WW2?
Your saying your attacking Ukraine because of self defense reasons f**k off Putin you just declared WAR on Ukraine I hope they are able to win good luck
The innocent lives lost. This is so heartbreaking. I pray for safety and strength for those innocent civilians. The children. The elderly. The women. The men willing to protect their families. Prayers for them all🥺💔
This is media at its worst.
Gg Putin. Neutralising all the biolabs.
In my eyes there must be a serious reason for him to do this. Not saying it is right just saying he must have his reasons. Russia gave their all in both world wars. Without them We were all defeated. I understand why they won't give it up so easy x
Where is so called leader of the worldOh its not Afghanistan Iraq
JESUS CHRIST LOVES YOU ALL SO MUCH
If Hitler eventually died, will another like.him and using what he accuses others e.g. Ukraine, of Nazism escape is a final question..
Welp so far the 20s has been a massive shit show we aren't making it to the 30s
I keep herein the media and politicians criticizes Russia for attacking Ukraine, yet no word on who's going to help Ukraine.

you haven't had the slightest interest in the ulkranian children being murdered by the unelected gang backed by the western fiscal cartel for the past eight years. But suddenly you are concerned now? Go on, away with you and your crocodile tears!
 @Craig Scott  unfortunately it isn’t until we’re made aware of something that we address it. Being from the US I’d be lying if I said I focused in on issues of other countries regularly. But once I know. I speak up. So fuck you for saying my emotions are not real because I didn’t know something. Prayers for Ukraine and prayers for those all around the world going through this type of situation. Unlike you I don’t know every issue on every surface of the world.
BBC is so full of shit.  How about giving both sides of the story for once?  Would the USA allow russians to build missiles systems in cuba or canada...or anywhere in the western hemisphere for that matter?  So we are surprised when a nuclear power says, 
It's saddening how quiet the Russian people are over this.  The Russian people need to take a page from the Dutch during WWII and everyone stop what they are doing and stand still.   Do not provide production and support for the military.  Evict the police from their homes.  Institute a nationwide sit in.
So ukraine don't have an air force?
What can west can do for Ukrainian?   This is crazy,  Trump is to blame 🙄

Putin is Alexander
F you putin! Liar, war monger, you’ve wanted this for years. You and China need to be wiped out
Psalms, 119:21 - You have rebuked the proud who are cursed, who wander from your commandments.   AMEN !

Putin has so much blood on his hands. From children, women, men. So many innocent lives gone because of him. Disgusting.
Just wake up already!!
God bless Ukraine and it's people.
Praying for Ukraine putin is tiranin nothing else
God bless Russia. Respect mr putin
love the gaslighting that putin is doing
REMEMBER RWANDA??? UNITED NATIONS LEFT AND ALLOWED THE GENOCIDE... UNITED WHO??? 🤔🤔🤔

War is bad, but this is history in the making!
Are the Russian people protesting? Tell your president you don't want this war
Well done to Poland in opening their borders with not the need of passports to the Ukrainians, well done tk other countries on stopping businesses with Russian companies, sponsorships, professional teams like schalke getting rid of Russian sponsor! Every country coming together to damage Russia economically and standing with Ukraine !
Do you the putin would tell the truth?
those are some sort of su series strike jets maybe su37s
The BBC propaganda is as good as any Nazi material under that regime!
All because of ukraine Wants to nato which is inacceptable the same situation was inacceptable for usa back then
Last biden putin meeting they signed a deal, that us wont stop rus from taking ukraine
That first reporter is using the Russian pronunciation of Kyiv, wtf.
The Modern War Exercise!
All President Putin is is another Adolf Hitler lying and deceiving his people and trying to deceive other people as well and trying to brainwash them to try to make himself look like he's a good guy
Fireworks. where is USA NATO 🤔new world order putin Russia
He is possessed by the devil! It’s the only explanation for his thirst for war. Praying for Ukrainians and Russians to not fight his war for him while he sits in his palace drinking tea.
Why couldnt the west work with Russia
Pandemic had already brought people down, drained finances and utilities and now attack!
Where in the world is the Ukrainian army, they are just letting this shii happen? why wont they retaliate, fck NATO or UN.. all they do is virtue signal and put sanctions which is BS
Russia is virus to the world 😡😡

please have heart, you can not killed innocent people. if you want to have war that bad, just fight between soldier or politician. not civilian please. what do they do to you to be deserve this?
This could have been stopped. Too little too late. Trust Putin to do what he promises. Russia at the border. Just sitting waiting for Putins army to strike. No forethought what so ever from the world.
they are working in tandem with china , china will take Taiwan 100%
A disaster created by the DEMOCRAts and NATO

I have to comment that it is appealing that YouTube is running commercials on these videos.
Definitely not good idea poking bear. It's Putin not Yeltsin
Wow. This Putin guy aint right in the head.
After hearing they’re targeting civilians and residential buildings?! That’s a line that shouldn’t be crossed. Death to the Russian army awaits. Ukraine 🇺🇦 x 🇺🇸
Every nation must learn to treat their minorities well. A minority in your nation might be a majority in another nuclear armed one. Fascist dominated nationalistic thought has no space in modern society.

Oh... Russia yeah they're bullies .the government will bully their own citizens in Russia .for speaking their mind and standing up for what they believe in. shame Russia !👎shame. you don't have no shame? Russia need to go sit down somewhere! and go watch whatever the f*** you do! like what the f*** are you doing Russia 🪆? Now when something happens to y'all don't ask nobody !!no Nations !!!for help. all right? when y'all start starving and it's going to be Putin's fault !and your citizens will turn on you putttin. Because you didn't take any of your citizens or civilians of  Russia concerns or opinions and to consideration! Be fore taking this drastic action's! it seem's like putin is doing this all by  his self! The Russian people don't even really want to war! And this man putin locks his own Russian citizens up for opposing his decision! and protesting against war! Shame Putin shame on you!👇 Now because of your actions when Russia begins to suffer in some sort of way it will be your fault! putin. 👇and it will be your citizens and civilians that will turn against you!! For putting them in a bad way! putin👇 and have you👇 thrown out of office for your uncompromising and uncivil behavior. I mean for real is this all really necessary? are we not smart enough I mean government leaders and officials or our egos so   big that we can't compromise? and work together?
As usual propaganda of West can be seen from the video, publishing fake interviews. For one, no one speaks fluent English in Ukraine. People of Ukraine for sure must be blaming west much more than Russia for their current state, for leaving them high and dry. They were always better off with Russia with which they have centuries old history. This entire thing is the doing of West. Brainless aggression in the form of NATO, now they are caught off guard. The puppet government from the West has no support of its own people, Ukrainians for sure identify with Russians much more than west, but it is the people of Ukraine who are suffering now.
Protesters arrested calmly un like in Canada they beat the proters! Common people never want war, it's the dictator from all sides! My hart is with the people!
Where is NATO
You could liken Putin to Hitler, and Mussolini. Putin DENIES his plan is to attack, then attacks. He created false flags to validate his actions. WE ARE NOT BLIND. This is shocking, and unprecedented in modern times, Putin has a LOT to answer to for this. I just Hope NATO is preparing (really preparing) to end his tyranny.
The president of Ukraine is risking his people, when your father is talking to you please listen 👂
This is a real war - for this you do not need to pour sand in your eyes, the evidence will wash everything away
and the russians still wonder why literally everyone hates them
Ooh we need peace, in this world 🙏🙏
Fake
Let peace prevail 🙏
I stand with Ukraine
Maybe ukraine's president need to tone down his speech. Civilian lives are at stakes.
When I saw that civilian building my heart sank, literally innocent bystanders killed :(
West is responsible for innocent lives that will be lost and will be held responsible.Nato europe must stop bullying Russians ENOUGH 😡😡😡
buy as much bitcoins as you can with ukrane money, move out of the country, sell all you bitcoins into another currency and live somewhere else?
in canada protesters get arrested to sane as Russia
America should invade Russia
Stay strong Ukraine 🇺🇦 we love you from Cambodia 🇰🇭
😱😱😱
i would have never let them get so comfy i would have hit them earlier
Putin should teach a lesson to NATO especially UK which is responsible for countless deaths around the world.
well Ukraine has been murdering their own citizens in Donietsk and Lugansk for over 7 years now. 14.000 dead up till now 3.300 citizens. Putin found the perfect excuse to assume the role of mesiah. The sad story is that the Ukrainian people have to choose between 2 dictatorships.

The Russians and Ukrainian people are 100% innocent and are the victims in all this ! The Leaders on all sides need to back off from this sheer madness !
Hope Ukraine become iraq.
The most important question has not yet been asked. Why do the people of Lugansk and Donetsk want to join Russia at all costs? Ukraine has had plenty of 30 years to prove why it is good to live in Ukraine. In 30 years, the Ukrainian leadership has made the lives of all citizens impossible. He ruined the lives of families with his idiot politics. Whoever could only try to get a job abroad so that his family would not starve. In 30 years, every working system that would have benefited the Ukrainian nation was privatized so that the swollen oligarch, would fill his pockets and get to heaven through the sweaty work of the Ukrainian people. By the way, they were the first rats to be pulled out of Ukraine to save their miserable life.
Putting is that student of history 😂😂😂
NATO is not coming to help you!
My prayer for Ukraine civilians.
Где вы были 8 лет назад? Твари, ответственные за геноцид в ЛДНР будут наказаны, Украина будет демилитаризована и будет жить мирно, без западного говна.
We must to stop Putin!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I don't know what to do
Never trust Russia or China
funny when democratic countries support russian dictatorships just because they can buy cheaper weapons.
Democrats in USA have themselves to blame no one fears Biden
I am getting death threats
As mahabharta says civilians should be spared from violence of war .
2022 unbelievable. Even Russians must believe that this is wrong.
Didn’t Israel do this to Palestine with the aid of the west? Then Russia’s media was basically saying exactly what these western media are saying 🤣🤣🤣 the world is all a joke folks
What happened to all of the javelin rockets ??
What did UK think?.. NATO on Russian borders... Not happening...once again.ukranians paying the price while british and americans sit back and watch.on.their giant tvs
We desperately need a Lee Harwey Oswald 2.0 Russian Version, to stop Putin from destroying his own and other countries. Ukraine is only the beginning. Poland could be next.
Both sides are Russian language speaking, so be with Russia.
You can just bark and yelp. The West is so impotent.
To save your country,  all you have to do is to stay away from US and NATO and kick them out of your country!
Stay strong Ukraine 🇺🇦
War is a terrible thing, that's true. But all people who are praying for Ukraine now and saying all those bad things about Russia, where were your prayers when Ukraine killed people from Donetsk and Luhansk Republics for 8 years??? Why are you not talking about that?? Russia is trying to help those people and protect its borders! There should be peace everywhere, so let's pray for peace.
We are against this war. Thoughts and prayers from Singapore to Ukraine 🇸🇬❤️🇺🇦
This is to make the world fear putin
Simula na Ng ww3
Wtf
Yea💯, 40 million Ukrainians don't want communism anymore after tasting the freedom of Capitalism.🇺🇸
If the population doesn't want their government doing what it is doing then it sounds like it's time for another revolution over there!
PIECE OF SHIT BIDEN REALLY FUCKED THIS WORLD UP
Horrible rebels fighting against the Russians why can't they just lay down their arms and stop nato pushing on Russian borders. A lot of Ukrainian people already identify as russian or at least independent of the tyranical ukrainain state. American interests in the raw materials in Ukraine are the only reason any of this is happening. Russia hasn't invaded or started a war it's peace keeping preventing a larger war further down the road
What is NATO, US, UK and Germany doing. Simplybtalking and no action.
Ukraine just fcujking join the Russian Federation And chill out
This is horrible. My heart goes to the people of Ukraine. Prayers and support from Pakistan 🇵🇰🙏🏻
People nerver learning from history.

Russia is not communist
 @Corvid  I don't buy your lie even for one second. Russia is communist.
 @Andrei S  Perhaps you missed the news, but the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Russia hasn't even claimed to be communist for decades.
 @Corvid  aparently it never collapsed and communism still is the biggest threat to US🇺🇸, if not Russia wouldn't attack Ukraine with it's 40 million population you stupid.
 @Corvid  Russia is attacking Ukraine and it's 40 million people because Russia is still communist.
 @Corvid  Ask yourself why else 40 million Ukrainians who don't want communism after tasting capitalism's freedom are now evacuating Ukraine?
 @Andrei S  1. It did collapse, otherwise countries like Ukraine wouldn't be independent. 2. Russia has a capitalist economy. 3. Why would Russia need to be communist to invade another country? How does that factor into anything at all? You know countries of other economic systems, including capitalism, go to war, right? Communists did not invent war. 4. Ukrainians are evacuating because their country is being invaded. That tends to happen during war.
 @Corvid  lmao 😂🤣🤣Do you hear yourself how stupid you sound? 40 million 
 @Corvid  Why the hell would Ukrainians 
 @Andrei S  I meant to say evacuating, apologies. Now that that's fixed, why not try responding to any of the actual points I've made?
Putin said that if someone help Ukraine they will get the worst thing in their whole history

It's too bad the billionaires are deciding when people get to live and die.
Putin...the world is disgusted.
Putin wants to invade Ukraine because he doesn’t want to be neighbours to a threat but he’s the one causing the bloodshed and damage dafuq 😂
Sociopaths
You'd think we've changed after WWII, we haven't....
Yeaayyy!! War of World part 3 will coming soon 💪💪if the third world war occurs,I hope China will be destroyed by the enemy. 😅
If this was in the middle east everyone would blame islam, as if muslims live in a perfect world with no political, security or regional issues and the root of all thier problems and conflicts is islam. Lol

Let's remove that country from the map bye bye Russia
Fuck Russia and China
I feel bad for the people there god bless the Ukrainians
Russians must pay with their blood for these despicable actions
you only know how to talk, have you forgotten about 1939?  do not be afraid Putin will come for you with China and then you will know what war is and, secondly, which of you will fight LGBT?  Gender?  now you are weak and they will take advantage of it
Prayers for the people. Europe beware this incursion will extend beyond the Ukrainian borders. God bless
we can’t even reach 100 years without a war in Europe… God damn , i hate this shitss called humans
Get a load of Putin. Denazification of Ukraine? Are you kidding me?
Putin is a Dic.
Protests end the same in Britain and Canada now to, you leftist f**k. Unless you are BLM freaks burning and killing, that is.
Emergency

God, prayers, best wishes, will do nothing
Only for money but we gone with nothing. God Createur will judge all evil mans .
Just think if the US had not meddled in Ukraine and backed up a bunch of fascist Nazis and threatened Russia's security none of this would be necessary... Piss off NATO
Self defense my as*
Fuckkkk you Russia 🇷🇺☠️☠️☠️☠️
I've seen the dead bodies of soldiers on WSHH.
George Galloway indicated support for Putin.
Send Putin a drone ☠️
You know there are nazis fighting on Russia's side too, right?
BBC . Probably fake
My heart and thought goes to the Ukrainians, stay strong! ❤ and as a German, I hope that my country will take a stronger stance against the aggressor Russia, it's overdue.
Dr Itepu on YouTube has the Permanents cure for herpes virus, visit him now and be free.

This Little Man Putin is acting like the little man Bonaparte showing off that his little stature is greater than the NATO allies????? His ego is BIGLY than his morality and {in}humanity????? He is a bully who cries because he cannot have the toys he wants?????
Hmm, a show with fake actors. Of course, every Ukrainian speaks English, it's funny.
Who profits from this? Of course always the US, they needed just to provoce another war to make themselves a little richer while people in Ukraine suffer. They are are as responsible for this war as Russia.
Only little attacks here in Canada. Same enemies tho. Gaslight attack BC Canada.. Our government systems have been compromised. The same enemies want to overthrow the Ukraine government

Like what? Another WW? Not a good position in this case, it's too late to do something with this war, because it's happening right now and Putin won't leave until he wins, no matter what, you should think about this previously, you all had 8 years to solve conflicts in Donetsk and Luhansk, but you didn't. You are all westerns are traitors and cowards, gave up Ukraine with no help, but made them against us just to make another reason to hate us. Sanctions against average Russian people only proves my words, as there are no a single sanction against Putin, it seems like western governments have no brain at all, only make suffer citizens of Eastern Europe countries and now they're killing their economics and ours. Good job west, America did earn a lot money from EU, now they will sell you the gas 3x times more expensive than Russians.

I really hope the rest of the world will stand behind Ukraine and not allow this to happen 🙏.  I fear for the entire EU if Putin is allowed to  take Ukraine..
Why hasn’t puttin been assinated surely the Russian people cant be happy with what’s happening here
Were are you bean 1999 when nato bomb Serbian civilians,?
My prayers for Ukraine people🤲❤️❤️❤️
https://youtu.be/wPe34N1UCY4
Take my words no neto or any country will stand with Ukraine. All fake. Ukraine will.be occupied by Russia in a week. I feel pity for Ukrainians.
Ukraine had a chance to join NATO but they chose to stick with Russia because of their money... now Puttin is trying to justify his invasion. Decisions people make comes to haunt them.
Love from the US ... We stand by Ukraine and the Russian people who want peace. If we are called to fight, we are ready and willing 🇺🇲🇺🇦🇷🇺✌️
My heart goes out to all of them 😒
People help us. We are attacked from three sides. From the sea, Belarus and Russia.🇺🇦😥
God bless Ukraine
It's reminding me when Palestina was attacked by Israel. Hope this world gonna be better
They are not NATO members. They should have petitioned to join NATO long ago. They were asked if they wanted membership. They were worried that membership would exclude them from trade with Russia. Yanukovych decided co-operation with NATO would be enough but membership would not be a priority. Yanukovych fled Ukraine during the Euromidan protests revolution in 2014. The Yatseniuk government came to power and stated it did not have any intention of becoming a NATO member. These are facts. My only opinion is they should have petitioned to join NATO if they wanted protection.  Membership likely would have prevented this in the first place. They should not be able to drag us into war after the fact.
The funny part is when Putin said Ukraine and Rusia are one people...good treatment if thats the case
Russians so afraid of Obama and Biden that they have to go hide in Ukraine
I am currently under attack
If this is fail to halt then in near feature  some independent smaller countries r at stake
Blame the Left for convincing Ukraine to give up it's nuclear arsenal.
The whole of Europe, not just the EU. I fear this will become another world war.

Don't respond to the  Russian biased replies, its the Kremlins Propaganda machine typing them.
 @ItsJoshlol  Just another useless waster of oxygen enjoying that their country is killing other humans for the fun of it. Disgusting I know
You were not so humane to disapprove NATO bombing of my country in 1999?? Western hypocrites... 🤢🤮
 @СРБIN Russia is alone....
https://youtu.be/thADhg3M3yIhttps://youtu.be/thADhg3M3yI
 @СРБIN  No we didn't decide that, the bullshit governments decided that. Try again sweet pea, civilians don't have a say in anything. Do me a favor and stop wasting our oxygen lmao
 @СРБIN  fuck Russia.. u bet your ass America is the land of high powered guns. Everyone in every race is strapped and will blow your face off.. and our gangstas are the worst. Russia ain’t ready for us🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸.. Real fighters here
We don't care if you're alone or not. We're ready.
 @TrillzMack713  Just try it 
 @СРБIN  what happen to Russia in Afghanistan lol
 @СРБIN  You guys couldn’t even make it past the line, your getting your asses kicked by a much smaller and less armed country, with months of prep time I might add, your soldiers are probably starving as they engage Ukrainians, Russia officially set a record of sucking at invading.
 @Overland117  First of all im not Russian and 2nd this is not invasion it's clearing a land from western nazi puppets that were put there by 4th reich amurica.
 @TrillzMack713  real talk👌🇺🇲
 @СРБIN  OmG NaZiSss soo scary!! OH no I'm shaking in my boots that America is becoming nazi Germany when us the states are getting sick and tired of our government instead of praising it. You're clearly not needed here lmao. Go cry on reddit.
 @СРБIN  Also no one gives a fuck about you or your 
 @СРБIN  That does not give The Kremlin any right to invade Ukraine. I do not approve of NATO bombing any country when it is not in self defence.
 @Trashboªt  I don't care about your opinion, stupid kid.
 @СРБIN  And none of us care about yours you waste of oxygen lol have fun going back to your cave xD
 @СРБIN  Aww did your little comment get deleted? Sounds like you are starting to understand how useless you are to the rest of the world lmao good for you
 @Trashboªt  Lol go to sleep kid of course my comments are deleted since im on western chanel 🥱😂
 @Neil Hands  Who gave the right to NATO to invade countries across the 🌍🌎?? United Snakes 🐍 of America allong with their puppets UK , Germany and FrAnce invaded countless of small countries and killed millions of civilians.
 @Neil Hands  And don't talk bullshit that it was 
 @СРБIN  No sir you go back to bed in your cave. You and your stupid country is just a waste of space. Especially you.
 @СРБIN  You be like 
 @СРБIN  Also you: 
 @Trashboªt  Who told you i won't help RUSSIA? I helped once in 2014 and i will do it again! Hopefully this time with CHINA and IRAN we will reach Washington too.
 @СРБIN  then go do it instead of being Mr keyboard warrior I'm waiting
 @СРБIN  I wanna watch America fall just like you, but ill still see you as a waste of oxygen when all you do here is complain and cry about such a scary spooky America. Lmao
 @СРБIN  That's the real hypocrisy, you're still here instead of being in Ukraine fighting. You rather cry then man up and fight. I'm wanting a nuclear winter, let them strike America because I'm sure my ignorant country is just gonna fire back till we both become a radiated cespool of lands.
 @Trashboªt  You are waste of oxygen for me too because you westerners are all cockroaches 🪳
 @СРБIN  So are you and your people, that's the difference you are too blind to see we are all parasites. Lmao go get free will for once
 @Trashboªt  Man you are just a troll with no facts plus you're mad 💢
 @СРБIN  I'm not mad friend I just find it funny you are like everyone else. Pick a useless side in a useless conflict. You sure you aren't the troll for coming into a western website and spewing captain obvious facts?
 @СРБIN  Oh and bless the bombing of 1999. One more step to getting 
 @Trashboªt  Oh don't mind me coming here on western chanel spreading truth, i want to open westerners eyes, U.S.A and it's puppet states started this war in Ukraine.
 @СРБIN  I have no idea what you are talking about, I did not support any of these wars.  You appear to be using this to justify your position on the Ukraine invasion by Putin, there is no justification for unprovoked attack on another country, whether Russian or Western.
 @СРБIN  back at it again with just pointing fingers like every other idiot. Bro I said captain obvious facts, we already know about all of that. Do we really care? No. So do you wanna keep arguing with someone who also agrees the west is shit but so is the rest of the world or do you wanna agree that we are all piles of shit that need to die off?
 @Trashboªt  I agree on your point 👉 that someone needs to die and that is warmongers from USA not the people , ordinary people are innocent just living their lives and i hope none of them will die i just hope to see Pentagon in flames 🔥 if they continue to harass free peoples of earth 🌍🌎.
 @СРБIN  No we all need to die, and your just mindlessly ignoring that statement. If it's not THE US it's someone else. It's always gonna be be why can't you admit that? There's no such thing as peace
 @СРБIN  And yes us innocent civilians are always dragged into the governments stupid games. Wanna know how to fix the world? No government
 @Neil Hands  My point is nobody condemned NATO when bombed my country 👉 🇷🇸  all of you westerners were ok with them killing innocent civilians, women and children... and now you're all of a sudden 
 @СРБIN  No we never were okay with 
 @Neil Hands  I was 9 years old when first bombs dropped on my country and siren's started for aerial assault. NATO poisoned my land with depleted uranium ☢️ that was put in bombs, my people are dying of cancer and suffering consequences of their 
 @СРБIN  And I'm sorry humanity's destruction was on your beloved country. NATO has been a disaster and I don't know why my country wanted back in. Did you know America wasn't supposed to get involved with Europe after we kicked them out of our land?
 @Trashboªt  By the way which country are you from friend?
 @СРБIN  America itself. And yes I hate my country ever since I learned how disgusting we were to turn our backs on the founding fathers warnings. Trust me, we didn't wanna be the 
 @Trashboªt  I must say that i learned your language as a kid by watching your movies, i love your way of living you are wealthy country , i love your games too currently i play 
 @СРБIN  And that's why we as Americans need to overthrow our government like our constitution states. We want the world to stop hating us for no reason? Take out the criminals in charge and give them to Europe to get torn apart. We Americana do not like violence or war, our government does because just like every other country they think they can profit off of others resources. And right there is the causality of mankind. Greed. All we Americans wanna do is create art, music , and show off talents. Not fight in another pointless European war
 @СРБIN  We really never wanted to play pretend 
 @Trashboªt  One more thing i have a brother living in Chicago he went there in 1991, we Serbs don't hate America we just hate their aggressive stance and politics towards small lands that can't defend itself.
 @СРБIN  which is our greedy government that's also hurting us. Why do you think us the people have been trashing their cities? We are tired of them and they fear us because they know they take one more step at us we will be the ones locking them up. I honestly think the hate for 
 @Trashboªt  Trump was a genius and a peacemaker, i don't understand why Americans voted senile Biden instead of him... Do you know how the world should function?? U.S.A and RUSSIA and China working together in peace ✌️ for the benefits of humanity.
 @СРБIN  That's the thing Russia will probably never work with us as we will probably won't work with them because our governments despise each other. We as a whole planet needs to drop the war acts and just live mutually. If we keep fighting we won't be able to defend ourselves from things that will threaten the human race. Aka our planet changing from our pollution to try and stabilize itself. Basically earth is gonna pump out way more natural disasters and there's nothing we can to really stop it. It's natural and the earth is always changing. We need to not be split nations and become humankind without tearing each other apart. The creation of nuclear power was a backwards plan for our survival as a species. We don't need nukes to begin with
 @Trashboªt  Which state are you currently from?
 @СРБIN  I'm from the northern east part of the country we call new England because we were the first colonies to arrive back in the days of old. Mostly Massachusetts
 @Trashboªt  Ok bro im sending you much love from Serbia 🇷🇸

 @Bully McDouble  nazi soldiers and normal soldiers are different, nazi soldiers are the ones who genuinely believe in the funny moustached man, the normal soldiers are just the ones who follow orders
So we’re going to forget about the Cuban Missile Crisis…. America has been doing this for DECADES
 @OGCinema  no they havent?
Z world. :D TV War....distractions from 5th session of the Grand Jury Proceedings.
Tell me when it goes out to them 😂
 @Chrysoar  The Russian soldiers fight for what they believe is right, just like any other soldier does. Although what soldiers believe to be right may differ a lot depending where they are from. The Russian soldiers probably do believe that what they do is the right thing to do, because that is what they have been told.This does not change the fact that what the Russian soldiers do is bad, in fact what they do is awful and unforgiveable.
When you start blaming the countries people and not government decisions you're just as bad. We're all human. Government makes the call, and troops are doing their job for their families. Both sides. They're just like you, they wake up eat breakfast and love someone.
 @Konrad Stenvall  It’s people like you that make me worry about the well being of the future of the world.
Just showing off because of verified...and i don't know if you're saying it as joke or what this is not even funny
 @Xliptical RL  I'm sorry man, but it is how it is.
 @Wadud Khan  I understand what it is you are saying, but no one is trying to blame the soldiers, the people or anyone else but Putin and his government at all. The thing is that even though the soldiers are normal people like us that doesn't mean that taking peoples lives because they believe that's the right thing to do can be excused because ''they where told to do it by someone else''.edit: I guess there are exceptions.

Welp
Russia resign from Europe please! 😡 You ain't welcome anywhere anymore
Russia 🇳🇱💪
How's it self defense? Russia invaded them.
........Ukraine going to have an East/West Germany era it would seem.    The question is - who is lined up for the contract to build the wall?
Where is fuck UN
Trump would of had boots on the ground and yes we would be at war, but Russia just needs its but kicked badly , and Putin killed … Ranger up

Putin, you can take the boy out of the KGB but you can't take the KGB out of the boy.
Bless the people of Ukraine. My heart goes to you, from America. ❤️
Okay so Putin sent troops and yet he said that its not for war? Thats like being surrounded by enemies who claim to just want peace. I feel sorry for the mums, dads, teenagers and elders. Why can't humanity coexists and live in peace and harmony as we will not live eternally. I just pray to God for the safety of the people.
yo wtf in 2022? he dun lost his mind

Putin should just be put down because he is a rapid dog. The west America and so on should all band together and take him down before it gets out of controll
Love and support to Ukrainian civilians from India.
Stay strong and fight back
OMG please help the Ukrainian people this is devastating
Yes, it is terrible when Russia does that ... And when the whole NATO alliance bombed schools, hospitals, television in the heart of Europe in 1999 in Serbia, violating international law, without the approval of the UN Security Council, supporting radical Islam terrorists, then you were silent
Dam why did the west have to poke the bear 🤦‍♂️
All the world fear putin.USA and his fellows. NaTo. God please protect Ukrainian.
America started it
https://youtube.com/shorts/eCgMVNeko9g?feature=sharehttps://youtube.com/shorts/eCgMVNeko9g?feature=share
 @Muhammad Abdullah  Why do you think America started this?
 @Muhammad Abdullah  how exactly, explain.
 @MeDuh_Shark  do your research.  People are tired of America putting puppets everywhere.  They tried in the Arab countries Afghanistan and some African countries and Ukraine.  America is trying to be the world police and there are a people who are tired . England and America is behind most evil of the world and only right minded people understand this and people see dollar signs and they except to be puppets so look what they brought on thereselves making innocent people suffer.  We should take every problem to there roots
 @Muhammad Abdullah  Thank you for explaining. I appreciate the knowledge, but I was just trying to show some sympathy for the people of Ukraine.
 @xjinit  I won't explain but use your brilliant mind to explore what has been said
 @Muhammad Abdullah  your talking complete shite fam
 @Muhammad Abdullah  yup, exactly as I thought.
 @Muhammad Abdullah  And yet Russia is still the one attacking a sovereign nation without so much as a warning. Let’s peel back the political bullshit for a second and look at this for what this is, a land grab.
 @MeDuh_Shark  this ain't got nothing to do with the people governments are tired of America and Russia wants to be the ones to show the Americans your not going to keep bullying everyone into being a puppet
That’s reliving to here because I don’t want my comment to literally be an entire political debate lol
 @Ryne Mcgriffin  what did the white American do to the Native American Indians  sir. Ummmmmm I think land grab . The problem is American puppets that putin is putting an end to. Look what happened on Syria America wanted to put a puppet Russia blocked it same in Venezuela
 @MeDuh_Shark  America has a problem with Russia taking over someone else land . I am Half black American half Native American Indian.  Who started this taking over land business the white American took over the Native American Indians land there sovereign land so please of course this is not a debate.  In reality Russia is taking its own land back they are the same people.  America took somebody else land. Who was against America trying to occupy Afghanistan ? That's not there land
 @xjinit  see I told you you have a brilliant mind continue to use those thoughts
 @Muhammad Abdullah  why are you continuing to use an American application if you hate America so much?
 @xjinit  so in other words I use no American application I am not the applicant nor the invader but check anyone else who is other then black American or Native American Indian. So please keep your brilliant mind working
 @Muhammad Abdullah  dude again you're over here bad mouthing the west as you use the west's innovation and infrastructure, what have your people contributed to modern society exactly?
 @Tom  you spelled shit wrong and that's your opinion.  Tell America if they have a problem with land grabbing get the hell off the Native American Indians land.  This is a family Fued there in Russia. Ukraine belong to Russia.  Putin has ended puppeteering.  Russia never went  and enslaved Africa or invaded the Native American Indians.  He putting his own people in check
 @Muhammad Abdullah  I think you need to go retake 2nd grade geography class, Ukraine is not Russia. Russia has no claim to Ukraine. The Russian empire started in Ukraine not the other way around. Educate yourself.
 @xjinit   when our people welcomed the western people in our land America and fed you from our hand I believe that was the biggest contribution because you use that kindness and took over and like Robin hood  you stold from the Rich and contributed to the poor.  So your modern reasons and achievements all started from the contributions of the pass. The black American built your country you bost about contributions today . What fuckin  contributions are you talking about ? You know what I think for a fool like you the best thing is silence
 @xjinit  don't matter where the Russian empire started like you said who has more contributions right idiot ? Russia has far more and they are showing it . Russia contributed the stop to puppet implanting caused by the west . God is having America get whipped by big brother Afghanistan now little brother Russia.  It's the hard truth boy. You will get over it. American people are different they are for the most part nice open hearted many have converted to Islam.  They want peace we all want peace there will be peace when dumb people like you stand up against real dictators and oppressers.
Bayraktars went into dust.
This is a time to use missiles on Putin directly at his home and bunkers...
Go on putin show the west what time it is
Ww3 is not a joke! Because big countries are greedy and bigoted
I doubted you BBC, but you weren't wrong.
My God this is horrible. Please enough .No war.
Putin’s tyranny has to be stopped! That dictator needs to be deposed!
This is the West fault for provoking Putin.Remember that anniversary recently of World War they didn't invite Putin after all the loss of lives of Russians and then this NATO BS
This is disgusting. Lost all respect for Putin.  He is an evil man to be able to kill civilians so casually.
More red flags that a Chinese opening Olympic ceremony.... Order out of chaos... They all freemason  these leaders...
What crap! Who does Putin think he is. He not God! Has no right in any way to do such things to anyone any where. No one does!  May the earth rise up and knock Putin down.
Ohh God 🙏 pls help Ukraine,fighting the devil
I think we can all agree that Putin is a modern day Hitler
Putin is a butcher killing his own  livestock
Please , Russia , bomb the buildings of BBC
Putin is attacking Ukraine because Ukraine wants to join NATO and the Ukrainian War in 2014 was because Ukraine wanted to join the  EU,  if Ukraine joins NATO it will be like keeping Nuclear weapons on Russia's doorsteps hence Putin is doing everything to stop Ukraine from joining NATO, by overthrowing this Pro US Government and establishing a Pro Russian government.. Just like the US did in Iraq, Libya,  Sudan, South Sudan, Afghanistan, Nicaragua and so on
Putin is a paranoid schizophrenic who has managed to keep the true evil he harbors at bay until now. His usual bland, bored look has been replaced with an almost Satanic snarl when he gives his recent presentations. Someone like this is a systemic threat to the safety of the world.
Look media what have u done for the world
Why don't Ukraine simply surrender to Russia? U may think I support Russia no I don't... Just think about it Russia is so damn powerful & attacking, invading & capturing Ukraine is nothing for them... So what's the point of Ukraine defending & fighting against them when they r powerful... I get that a country has all the rights to defend & fight to protect their country but still in this case it's just pure stupidity & suicidal if Ukraine defends & fights against Russia.... Ukraine shud be focused on protecting their ppl NOT their land so the best they can do to protect their ppl is to surrender to Russia....  If they don't surrender & go with their countrys EGO what's gonna happen is Russia is gonna attack  & capture their country anyways so reagrdless Ukraine will have to surrender & also theres gonna be loss of innocent lives of their ppl....
Those jets are SU.35
Prayers for Ukraine 🇺🇦
This seems unreal! I can’t process it.
Russia's ruble plunged as a result of covid, yet Russia blames this on Ukraine, and not china
All the wars are stiupid.  This one is the most stiupid of all  wars ever.  Russian have families in Ukraine and Ukraineiens have families in Russia
In 2020 came the Azerbaijan and Armenian conflict... Azerbaijan's roof grew significantly larger when it emerged victorious from a 44-day war against Armenia for control of the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave. Both Azerbaijan and Armenia are nestled in the strategically important Caucasus Mountains, a region where Russia, Turkey, and Iran meet.. Coincidence?? I think not... Ezekiel 38 is here...
Just dont ever poke the bear!
Fuck we should not bring anything that is Russian or anything related with Russia because Putin

God damn you Putin.
Russia is honestly CRAZY!!!!
From a philosophical and historical perspective, war serves its purpose. It's a tool for enlightening the masses, just as the covid lockdown was. People need to be pushed to rock bottom to awaken. Historically periods of great suffering are followed by evolutions of the human consciousness, manifested in the form of new concepts and ideas.Suffering causes evolution. The 
All the Americans sending prayers!! Send the Marines    Wwhooo Rrraaa MF'S
World war lll is almost here boys get ready!!!!
Well done putin you have ruined everything like always stay strong ukraine😔😡🇺🇦🙏

The beginning of world 3
Putin did the right thing.
I love Ukrainian people
#standwithukraine #stopputinnow
SURRENDER AND THE PROBLEM TOPS! So stubborn! G
Self defence eh? I feel absolutly sick. This is BS!
I feel sorry for Ukrainians, I don't hate Russia, I hate war.I know that my words mean nothing, but I'm sure I'm not the only one who hates war.Dear Ukrainians, be safe.
The Russian Dictator Putin must feel personally the consequences of his evil actions not juts impose sections but militarily action.
Well I guess metro 2033 will be coming earlier than I expected.
I appreciate decision of Britain in this ukraine russia conflicts
You’re on your own. Fight your own battles.
May God be with you and give us his peace!
So sorry about the new british navi base
What an irony. The same people who were once the same fighting each other because one wants to side with an outsider. Putin should not touch the civilians. Putin must understand that he's not Russia. The people dont want this war.
Putin has a tiny, tiny penis. Fact !
🙏🙏💐💐🇺🇦
Wow horrible. Hope is peace
This is so sad ... my heart is with ukraine people.
Tips for Taiwan : Don't believe usa and west, build your own weapon.
Isn't the president of Ukraine literally Jewish? What the f** he means denazifcation of Ukraine?? There are Nazis everywhere
Ukrainians must unify to join with Russia. Because their govt. officials are more corrupt (like my country Philippines) than Russia.
The big man!
Are they going for world war
I wish that all those  whoever they are, that want war would die in their sleep.
https://youtube.com/shorts/eCgMVNeko9g?feature=share🙂👆
Now Biden is going to pull out the taxpayer checkbook and pay Russia not to do what he has already done.
Yall heart goes nowhere
🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
Ukrainian, lay down arms without a fight and kick out US to save your country and your countrymen!
The problem goes to the Ukraine government. The minsk agreement should be implemented. 8 years are too long. NATO should stop expanding to Russia border. If NATO is not treatening Russia this horrific incident would not happened.Each story has two sides. I dont trust BBC.
Stop Putin the Murderer... his Mind is full of worms.... it's all a fabricated LIE!    STAY WORLD WIDE STRONG
Hail Russia...Russia will reunite all its former territory  🇷🇺
The biggest crime of the Ukrainian people is that they did not throw out the US spy Jewish comedian president who led them into this
Its punishment of US
Oh yeah just surrender.  Let them take over?
Dear Mr Putin and Zelensky. Can you just kill each other to death in 1v1. instead of using innocent people.
What a loser 😡
Why do old folks always want war and send the youth to fights? Shame on them...
god bless Ukraine
It was an American missile
Blessings everyone GREAT WATCH HERE FOR EVERYONE 
The 3rd world war has begun...
Can somebody stop Putin? He thinks that he is a God lol😂😂😂😂
Shut up and go back to your demonizing America
Let's hope so, give these democrats a real reason to cry
 @Shane  nuclear holocaust to own the libs
BBC! do you translate Putin's speech incorrectly on purpose?
Biden protects Nazis.
Prypiat calling Puting... Prypiat calling Puting.Space weather is ok. Are we green for Go?Duga is ready.
that's what happens when you elect a stupid. Ukraine is right next to Russia, and Ukraine wanted to apply for NATO+ 2020 and had a joint military exercise with NATO in 2021. sigh, my lord, what were they thinking. Don't they know that once they're a part of NATO, US would have the right to publicly place troops and missile system inside their border? Was Ukraine waiting for a congratulation card from Russia?
That's great..good job  🇺🇸 n 🇷🇺 ..
If is any problem any  blood share you cost it America and NATO why you didn't listen to him is on part i don't know what is wrong whit America why they always doing evil things? America they have done it again 😭 😭 😭 peace and love
Everyone!* The Nobel Peace Prize for 2022, it is necessary to nominate the President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky, the citizen of the World Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the Russian human rights activist Navalny!!! We are for Peace and democracy!!!🤝
BBC: It's not Russians war it's Kremlin's war.Me: BBC is fighting for NATO/Biden's propaganda
PUTIN THE MURDER OF INNOCENT WOMEN CHILDREN AND BABIES ⚘THE WORLD SHOULD ATTACK RUSSIA.
Putins name means stupid and foolish…NATO should act now
Took a chapter from Biden’s playbook.  Take the airport out of the way no one can come or go.  Now watch China!
The main reason why Russia is attacking Ukraine, is because the Ukrainian government is aligning themselves with the West.  This makes the Russian Government nervous and anxious!
So the billions or arms sent to Ukraine soon will be under Russian hands.  Are Ukrainians fighting back?
Is America next?
1.07 - Residential buildings? Derelict more like.
This mf has lost his got damn mind.
The United States is responsible on all sides because it fights between two nations and then sits comfortably...
History repeats itself again! Nazi invade but this time is from the east. NATO and US are only watching it and let it happen. Just like WWII that is not long ago. Sad!
Knowing what it means to be invaded by such superior army in numbers and equipment I'm fully with Ukrainians. Never give up, support from Bosnia and Herzegowina
https://youtube.com/shorts/eCgMVNeko9g?feature=sharehttps://youtube.com/shorts/eCgMVNeko9g?feature=share
Yh heard about that it might happen again. Stay strong and God forbid it won't happen. 🇧🇦
USA shouldn’t have invited Ukraine to nato and Ukraine shouldnt have accepted. Civillains should’ve protested that. They asked for war and now that it’s here they’re playing poor me card. As much right as Ukraine has to join nato, they simply can’t. Russia won’t let American troops share borders with them. Common sense
 @Driggy  Ukraine is now the battleground between the two bigger players in world politics.
Love your user name tho
 @Dtboss33jr   absolutely. It wouldn’t have come to this if Ukraine had respect for someone they share border with that can flatten them. You don’t see Canadians allowing Russian troops to hang out next door to America
I hope this war exacts a heavy toll on the Russian war machine. I hope Ukrainians are able to destroy as much of Russia's arsenal as possible.
 @karadan100  unfortunately it is a huge mismatch.
 @Driggy  exactly
 @Driggy  Thats because we we are all NATO, and you've gotta go Yuri
 @Driggy  what tf are you talking about? Russia has and does share an actual border with the US (Alaska), and a NATO border (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania). Keep your transparent pro-Russian brigading to yourself. All power to Ukraine, Putin is facing his doom and is trying to bring peaceful, democratic nations with him.
Peace will never come as long as Ukraine join NATO FORCE .How would USA feel if Russia starts to join forces with USA Neighbours ???I don't understand why USA/NATO had to build defensive forces on Russia Neighbouring Countries .Face the consequence now 🤦
Then you are an idiot cocaine.But the name already indicates as such.
 @Driggy  And that's an excuse for invading a country? I just hope someone will step in and help Ukraine unlike what happened here, where thousands of civilians were butchered because west failed to act. Sadly my country is irrelevant in these superpower conflicts, but I hope we'll be able to at least send supplies if needed (like many countries sent to us). Hope it won't come to that
 @zoro zoro  there already is you absolute fool:Alaskan land & sea border Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania…and no, thanks to Putin’s batshit aggression, Sweden & Finland.
 @zoro zoro  You don't understand because your country has not been occupied by Russia and you likely have not experienced what it was like being part of the Soviet occupation. It wasn't your relatives put on trains like cattle and being shipped to bolshevik concentration camps to starve and die. The former occupied countries remember very well and have given their lives to become free again. As will Ukraine
 @Driggy  screw you. Russia is a bully and will lose this war in the end
 @Driggy  stop the Russian apologising. Are you a shill?? There's is no sense in being scared of sharing a border with nato. Zero sense. There's no excuse for what is happening
 @Driggy  Ukraine was Literlly denied nato tf you talking about?
 @zoro zoro  you're a shill. Noone shares your moronic opinion
 @Driggy  Should or should not. Lol, so what you are saying is that that other countrys can dictate what they can or cant do,  i would strongly recommend not joining nato,  BUT if they want to do that, they can.
 @karadan100  восемь лет побеждали российскую армию ,а тут так жидко обосрались
Do you think putin stops at the Ukraine ? He is moving closer and not further to a NATO member 🤔
 @Driggy  simple and very clear. Unfortunately the West didn't get that point.I am sad about the innocent Ukraine people.
where have your hearts been for the past 8 years while western backed fourth reich gangs attacked east ukranians? The BBC are a state funded terrorist cartel!
 @Freedom for Ukraine  For your kind information USA has killed more people in the world compared to Russia . 🙏
 @karadan100   limited without western support, IMO.
 @Craig Scott  back in your box, “Craig”
Corrupt Europe donated in the dark, so much is our money, 17 billion euros to Ukraine, the people have not seen one. Do you really believe that Ukrainians are willing to be slaughtered for a bunch of pro-Nazi oligarchs with overflowing accounts abroad or for a puppet who came to power and immediately corrupted? Ukrainians will not fight for these corrupt, Putin knows.
You gonna pull up to Ukraine then?
 @Vincent Sheridan  going to send your terrorists impersonating constabulary to my door to extort revenue for the propaganda again? I don't negotiate with terrorists!
 @Craig Scott  lay off the bottle, dude.
 @zoro zoro  so? Irrelevant to what’s happening. If the only argument you can throw back is historical whataboutism, you don’t have a valid one. Their is no justification for Putin’s actions - and the Russian people know it. This will be Putin’s Afghan invasion - a tragic, unjust and utterly pointless loss of life on a massive scale.
 @karadan100  мне вас искренне жаль, как же запад промыл вам мозги. Украина 8 лет бомбили ДНР мы терпели, мы предупреждали, но терпение кончилось. Прошу заметить что мы не стреляем в мирных жителей, мы не бомбим города, мы бомбим по стратегическим объектам.
 @Driggy  well breaking news… Ukraine is tired of sharing a border with Russia. Maybe they should have preemptively struck Russia. Not logical. Any country has the right to NOT have a war or not be under a dictatorship if the choose. Not to be bullied by their neighbor to “Stay in line”. 🤦‍♂️
 @zoro zoro  🤣 Stalin killed more people during his regime than the USA has in its very existence. Funny guy.
 @Señor 5.7  the Native Americans say hello. They were wiped out from their continent, due to some principle of manifest destiny
I still remember that horrible conflict. I hope things will not get as gruesome as what your people had to endure....
​ @Freedom for Ukraine  Yeah, you gave you lives to be 
 @Señor 5.7  I pretty sure the US has killed far more than 20 million people in the last century during all the conflicts US has started combined. Same goes for the British empire.
 @Vincent Sheridan  Well said 👍🏻
 @Driggy  “you don’t see Canadians allowing Russian troops to hang out next door to America” Has America been under threat of invasion for decades? ...didn’t think soDoes Russia owe protection to Canada? ....didn’t think soIs Russia the figurehead of democracy in the world? ....didn’t think so
This is American in Vietnam situation this will be a super power fighting against guerrilla warfare it did not work out well for The U.S and I doubt it will work out the way Russia expects either
 @Maria Sechi  I suggest you do some actual research and not just mainstream media a lot of Ukraines are joining militia and are learning how to handle weapons and guerrilla warfare techniques this will be U.S in Vietnam all over again being a super power means nothing sometimes
 @Byttle Juice  Should've kept the treaties they signed. They broke them.
 @Why Bother  this is no US Vietnam situation my friend, the Americans and the Viet Congs are quite different culturally and linguistically, this is more of a situation of two closed relatives going at it. Eastern Ukraine is pro Russia while western Ukraine is not. Besides the Ukraine landscape is not condusive for guerilla warfare.
​ @Outlawfly  It makes sense to us. Only by having the joint forces in our country we feel safe from the small tzar. It is the leader of Russia that claims being threatened by NATO while ordering his forces to kill right this moment. You are right, THAT does not make any sense.
This is how Palestinians feel every day and have been for decades, America is funding and supporting Isreal while they do the same thing to Palestinians.
 @Abu Zaine  It is, but as Afghanistan showed everyone several times, you don't need high-tech gear to wear down the enemy.
Long Live Ukraine
Putin did not say Military operation. He said Special operation. what else are you mixing? Oh lots of things.
The best defense is a strong offence... Crush Putin at his home first... Let him feel the pain that he's caused...
Russia has already invaded the US, there are 3 millions Russians living in the USA and there are less than 20,000 Americans living in Russia.
war isnt like call of duty, you don't just die and wait to respawn. These are genuine lives being at risk. All those poor people who are and will be caught in the middle of this. I hope for your safety. Goodluck. Love Ukraine from the US <3
Self defense? They hit innocent civilians
If UK can send warships to South China Sea, why can't UK send troops to Ukraine to protect the people? Hope everyone in Ukraine is safe!
Lol shes shocked?  Really?
I was wrong. Putin has lost it! Dementia is a real problem when you get to be his age.
You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. ... 
What is wrong with Putin. They’re already helpless and he has the balls to say they feel threatened.
Calling all MERCENARIES around the world to fight with Ukraine.. this evil war freak Hitler in the making PUTIN must be stopped at all cost... ATTENTION ALL MERCENARIES, MILITIAS - - fight this devil PUTIN
Russians take to the streets of our cities! We must free Russia and Ukraine from this villain.
God protect Ukrainian and Russia. Don’t let them be bullied into a war. Show us the truth.
De 
Weapons of mass destruction the same old game .
Well i was thinking in the future that the New Russian President will over throw Vladimir Putin.The New Russian President will withdraw its troops from Ukraine. (Same as the Soviet-Afghan War) As the Ukrainian Citizens have finally survive from the Invasion.And will the New Russian President will give up Crimea to Ukraine.
Putin=Hitler👹👹👹👹👹👹
Shame shame west
Bruh
If West would truly stand by Ukraine, now there would be massive cyberattack on Russia, and AWACS planes escorted by F35s an F22s would be flying near ukrainian borders with NATO countries, at least to transfer some data to the ukrainian government in Kiev and elsewhere about movement of the russian troops in Ukraine. That's the smallest amount of help they could provide now to the people of Ukraine.
a snarling bbc, projects its lies, toward others.as bad as the so called 'news', in these United States ....
Interesting when you see comments on the RT youtube channel
Classic west propaganda , from one of the most warmongering nations ever : YOU .NATO is a total failure , EU aswell.
Where is NATO?
My heart goes to Ukrainian people. This is such a difficult moment and situation. Stay strong, safe and hopeful!
Are there any actual Ukraine people here, that could provide some insight. Especially from Donbass and  Luhans?
The comedian needs to resign. He was warned yet choose to remain in denial

Pray for the people of Ukraine, but the hypocrisy from the West is incredible.Слава Україні 🇺🇦 героям слава
Just sent thaliban 🤭
Let's go russia!
You have had since 2014 to stockpile food, arms, and training to get ready for this.    Why has Ukraine not formed civilian brigades, trained in civil defense, armed with rifles, explosives, trained in guerilla warfare ?!?!?    Your military can only do so much. It will require the will and grit off ordinary citizens to fight off Russian invaders.    Russia has proved it is NOT you brother. It wants to be your overlord. Denazification = Anyone who wants out from Russia's intimidation and looks west for a free, independent country. Anyone who will not be a puppet Russian controlled state. .
RIP humanity 😣
Hippocratic world.....You don't have any feeling for Palestinian, Syrian, Yemenis, Iraqis, Bosnian, Lebanonis, Kashmiri people but Ukrainian.USA ,UK, FRANCE..... working for arms and ammunition business but not for avoiding war. In fact NATO and USA is 95% responsible for this crisis.
What is west? An alliance formed to take over the world and in the end the west alliance would be abolished to become one leader of the world. You dont trust anyone within a group of a criminal gang.Uki leader shedding tears well people shed tears in hiroshima and nagasaki and in iraq and in afghanistan and in palestine besides you are shedding tears because of your own mistake, Russia warned. Gotta get back to playing call of duty. I need a ukrain mission now.I feel so sorry for that baby there, may he be safe. May all the kids and girls and elders be safe out there at all sides. I hate it when innocents have to suffer because of their curropt politicians.
Hold on Ukraine hold on.

Pray for Ukraine from germany 🙏
I hope I was wrong, but sadly I am not. People are suffering now. And NATO and US are not there to save them. They were quick to take nukes from them, however.There is still time for Ukrainians to surrender, they are not from a warrior race like Afghans, who can fight for 20-40 years non-stop. In this case its the same culture and religion too, so even less incentive and motivation to resist. The sooner they surrender, the better is the chance to strike a deal with Moscow which will give them some level of autonomy...
 @Rocky Khurasani  fuck that. They should fight. Fuck Russia
Dont be scard all r politics dramas
How are they supposed to say strong when they're being attacked?
Your heart doesn‘t help… just saying
https://youtu.be/tIxKmqNxThU
PUTIN is supporting FREEDOM AND THE INDEPENDENCE of Eastern Ukraine.You guys shamelessly support separatists in Taiwan and yet whining about what Putin is doing in the Ukraine. Pathetic.
 @Rocky Khurasani  when did NATO do anything anyway??
 @Kumar Ramishin  lol
You saying that on a YouTube comment means absolutely nothing.
Words don’t help. Ukraine and NATO will have to kill their way out of this.
 @Kumar Ramishin  man you sure you are Indian?see a sensible Indian after a long time
 @Rocky Khurasani  In my opinion Ukraine should fight till the last man. Russia will be hesitant to use Nukes in that area only way to stop a bully is to fight back
Peace will never come as long as Ukraine join NATO FORCE .How would USA feel if Russia starts to join forces with USA Neighbours ???I don't understand why USA/NATO had to build defensive forces on Russia Neighbouring Countries .Face the consequence now 🤦
 @Native  INDIANS are hiding under their momma's saris..They hate to offend both Putin and Biden.
Not with millions of dead innocent people of Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and Libya ?
I honestly don’t care about this war.
 @zoro zoro  bc its a tactical placement obviously...if a war happend usa can send their troops or their allied troops from a neighbouring country
Another idiot who doesnt understand a damn thing.

 @AT  Will USA be ok if Russia starts to build their forces just next door to US ???
true
 @zoro zoro  you sound stupid and like your just repeating things you saw somewhere think with your head…. NATO is a defense group them being on boarders of Russia which they already are is no threat….
 @zoro zoro  just shows Putin is a xenophobic tyrant.
My heart goes to Russian people. This is such a difficult moment and situation with the western devils starving the common people with their vile, elitist economic sanctions that does nothing but punch down on the common folk. Stay strong, safe and hopeful!
 @Rocky Khurasani  Imo Ukraine should’ve negotiated DPR and LPR but for Russia to invade further if I was Ukraine I would go to war
 @zoro zoro  ofc not...you ever heard about cuba??? Thats what they do...countries have their relations
Russian fighter jet attacks with air-to-ground missiles. Ukraine https://youtube.com/shorts/5pgp9ZYzbmk?feature=share   Ukraine
You heart also went to people on Siria and Irak right ?
 @zoro zoro  US has fairly good boarder relations so you hypothetical doesn’t work lol neighbors near America aren’t afraid of being invaded
where have your hearts been for the past 8 years while unelected western backed fourth reich gangs attacked east ukranians? The BBC are a state funded terrorist cartel!
 @AT  relations is ok . But not NATO .We Russian will never ever allow NATO forces near Russia . Its against National Security .We will make sure of it 🙏
Fuck Ukraine, love for Russia
What about kashmir .
Ukraine is fine, we need only one thing: US go home and stop interfering with us and Russia! We'll manage without NATO and US.
 @Gregg Reed  Russia will destroy any foreign forces near their borders .To protect National security will go to any extent .
Z world. :D TV War....distractions from 5th session of the Grand Jury Proceedings.
 @zoro zoro  ukraine is not even a nato member
https://youtube.com/shorts/eCgMVNeko9g?feature=share🙂👆
Prayers for the people of Russia
 @AT  Was about to Join NATO so Russia started to give warning but Ukraine already signed an agreement to join NATO and on top of that Russia was hit by heavy sanction which made Russia so angry .. now pay the consequences
 @Rocky Khurasani  So according to you Afghan Taliban are evil but you are the warrior raceWhile actually the Afghan Taliban faught for 20-40 years while you stated neutral and many even allied with the invading enemy?!
Your heart has no value
 @Rocky Khurasani  so just give in and let Russia do whatever they want? You think it’s gonna stop at Ukrain. Not a chance Putin is gonna go as far as he can and try and take what he wants. Should got rid of his ass years ago.
Putin's a world economic forum member. :D
 @Kumar Ramishin  it’s not up to Putin if this is not what Ukraine wants. I’d definitely fight until my last breath!!
No more european brother wars. This should not happen.
 @Rocky Khurasani  They should fight not give in to putin, im totally not for war butbthey have no choice.. If someone came to your house right now would you try to make a deal with them?? You want to see what they are going to offer you, maybe they will give you a bedroom in your own house..
So what about Donbass people??? They lived in war 8 years!!!
You should speak out now, make it known to whoever your supposed MP is, you do not want to be involved in a world conflict. Make no mistake, this is only just  beginning, I hope those people in the Ukraine, their hearts go out to us when the nukes start falling all around. Again make no mistake, if it's left to our current politicians the war in Ukraine will very quickly escalate to a full blown world conflict. How do I know this, because they have A) been trying to start a world conflict for over 15 years now. B) The time is now perfect, never before in history has a population been so subservient and malleable, due to a certain virus and how easily they ave away OUR rights. So try and stay safe.
 @Omar Martinez  no, usa should not intervene, if they do, ww3 will start
 @Maria Torres  And they will show resistance for some period, but then West will stop supplying weapons, and they will realise, why not sit at a table. After all they are almost same, culture religion etc.Remember they are not Afghans.Soviets last time colonised them too and  all of them surrendered except the Afghans.
And where was you hart last 8 years when Ukrainian army was shelling cities and villages of Eastern part of Ukraine, where most of Russian people are living, and how was your heart , when you were  listening about 15000 soldiers and civilians including children were killed in there?!
 @zoro zoro  what about Cuba Venezuela…???????????????????????
 @zoro zoro  they did once before you idiot…
 @Tania Benischke  ukraine deserves that,they were killing russians living in ukraine on the border for all the past years
 @Tania Benischke  Ukraine will be nuclear ground of NATO if Ukraine join NATOAlso Ukraine is Part of Russia our mother landPutin have good move to Russian and Ukraine people United in one countyKnow the history first before comment hard here
Peace 🇱🇰
Your 
It’s the west fault they want to build nuclear weapon sites on the Russian borders my heart goes out to all of humanity this could effect us all in a very very serious way with nuclear weapons heading our way
Fuck Russia
 @zoro zoro  keep believing that dream.
 @Saad Gull  kasmir belongs to India, that's it
 @Rocky Khurasani  True. Nato should just back off and let Putin have his way of governing that region. No need for  Sodom in Ukraine
https://youtu.be/VDu3w1DqGhw
 @Gayan Halangoda  you can’t have peace when a dictator with little man syndrome loves power and money and hates having a vibrant free country on his border
 @Kumar Ramishin  Taiwan isn't separatist lol. Taiwan is China on their eyes.Educate yourself please.
 @zoro zoro  Russian can't destroy foreign forces on their borders. They will never dare to atack the NATO troops on the Baltic republics nor in Poland. So you live in a fantasy.
 @zoro zoro  Ukraine wasn't about to join NATO. It was their goal, but NATO stated very clearly that would been maaany many years before that could happen.
 @Martin Mart  Our hearts was with the innocent people, as always. What makes you think differently?
 @Kendra  I'm an historian and I can tell you that history doesn't matter at all. This is just ambition of Putin, the last move of a dictator, no matter how many Russian lives are lost!
 @Kumar Ramishin  Putin ain´t supporting freedom from jackshit. Old dude is litteraly invading a free country, if he where to support easter ukraine he would have stopped at the borders from Luhansk and Donezk. Instead he came from krim, belarus, fired rockets into the whole country, he killed civilians with rockets in kyev far from those that apperantly needed his support. Obviously russian state controlled media is telling different stories but thats nothing new. Russian (still bloody soviet in mind) govermant needs to burn once and for all. Pay some chechen veteran 500k $ and he will love to kill Putin and get his own revench.
it's fun to watch fakes.)))
 @iLab Pennies  fuck off, don´t invade a country if you want to have food and money for your folks. there is something called international law, russia signed to it many years ago after soviet union fell apart. I hope russians will have a great time with their upcoming hyperinflation. Well deserved Mister Putler/Kim Jong Pu
 @Craig Scott  prorussian seperatists attacked east ukraine but whatever. go share some more fake info for beloved mother russia...
 @zoro zoro  Russia will starve to death, this war will be putins last mistake, he will be wiped of the face of this earth. I hope you have friends or relatives in the russian armed forces and some ukraine badass will muck them up real good for invading their beloved land.
What don't you understand?rUkraine got bad politicians! They want to annex Ukraine to Europe and NATO to the army !!rNobody asks anything ... it's important that politicians fill their pockets with money !!rThe people have brainwashed the roses to smell more beautiful in Europe ..rUkranie politicians provoked war! Because the rule is known that Ukraine cannot be a NATO country !! By the way, World War 3 starts ... And what ?? should that happen ???rUkraine should now capitulate ... and civilians should be saved ... and politicians should be hanged because they provoked the war !!
This is how Palestinians feel every day and have been for decades, America is funding and supporting Isreal while they do the same thing to Palestinians.
 @Lucy Ryan  Donbass has bern attacked  by  Ukraine  for nearly  eight years
 @Kumar Ramishin  westerner are double standard, Catalonia wants independence they calles them separatist, Donbas want independence they called them separatist when Taiwan and Hong Kong want independence they called them freedom fighter
Did you feel that way for the last 20 years we killed the Afghan people
 @Omar Martinez  no they should let Russia invade not fight, because there is no point
 @Kumar Ramishin  Putin is the ONE who created war in eastern Ukraine! He brought those terrorists and supports them. Do you have any Idea what means in those towns На подвал? They are torturing people in undergroundsAnd come on, tell me lies, I am Crimean, he occupied my home. He saved me from who? from my own country? wake up people
 @Kumar Ramishin  fool
 @get high  wrong! east ukranians have been crossing the russian border for days now! Not neglecting systematically attacked for decades! The unelected gang of forth reich criminals executed elected government officials in 2014. As for the state owned BBC, they sent goons to my door impersonating constabulary to extort revenue for not funding the foreign propaganda in 2010!Try your psychotic babbling with someone who hasn't read or understand 
Does your heart include the ethnic russians in Donbass (Ukraine) that have been fired at for 8 years by the ukrainian army and slowly starved to death by cutting power, water, food supplies, financial services?
 @Tania Benischke  From the country which once was ruled by Hitler?
 @Kumar Ramishin  why attack Western Ukraine and kill civilians
 @zoro zoro  America would never invade México if they teamed up with Russia. What right does Russia have the right to bomb Ukrainian soldiers
 @Craig Scott  it was the Russian sepratists backed by the Russian military that attacked the Ukrainians. That's what armed separatists do, they attack government and regimes
Because America and nato are the destroyers of this war, look at what has happened before, America is a coward who dares to attack, America is the destroyer of this world, facts, Read the history first. Ukraine used to be, what in Ukraine were mostly ethnic Russians, Russia had to protect its people from western Europeans, Mamarika and Natos
 @Wildan permana  yes Ukraine used to be a part of what was Russia. Countries often gain independence and why should the Ukrainians have to be a part of Russia.Would the British Empire have the right to invade Ireland to make it be a part of Britain again? Of course not. Same goes for Ukrainian. Western Ukrainians are not Russian but Eastern Ukrainians are I guessYou're indoctrinated while at the same time believing everything Putin's regime says. The facts are Ukraine was never a part of the Russian country apart from when the USSR occupied
NATO should NUKE russia before its too late, this is just the start of world domination
 @Forastero  Comments make me think differently. I never here and read about people cry for 8 years killing of Russians in Eastern Ukraine from shelling and terror acts from Ukrainian army and nazi battalions. And a few Ukrainian nazis to die in a few days ( no attack on civilians is conducted by Russian army and respect to Ukrainian soldiers which already give up their weapons understanding situation and reason )  to stop killing in Eastern Ukraine is making you so sad. Hundreds thousands killed and millions displaced by false justified or non justified US and NATO invasions to  different countries for years ,doesn’t bother you at all!
Stop be a puppet of western world 🌎... putin the great 🍸 from Jamaica with love ❤....
Can you please stop with the fake sympathy you’re probably out having a beer right now pretending like you care about innocent lives go do something about it !!!
 @Martin Curran  no it wasn't! It was a coup funded by the CIA. They have a long history of doing that! The biological weapon agent orange rebranded round up across 14% of north vietnam causing mutations. Radio active munitions littered across the middle east, east asia and north africa. Operation freedom in africa using child labour to mine resources for your phone and computer. Europe not paying russia $3trillion in oil revenue before the coup of the elected ukranian government. The government getting a deal with russia to supply europe at a discount before the coup.kievs illegitimate fourth reich ocupants attacking and murdering east ukranians for the past eight years after publically executing elected officials in the street, fire bombing police and shooting civilians. Not neglecting western ukraine has always been the aggressors towards the east long before that! ss 6th ukranian army committing genocide across europe mostly against their own people.u.k fraud office investigating the oil company Mr Biden Jr was ceo of three years before the coup! In the 10th c. the kievruss alliance sent 5.000 vikings to constantinople later becoming the varengian guard. charge of the light brigade, the thin red line. u.s. and british warships 12 miles from russias southern shores when 200 miles is standard maritime law. Yeah, you are repeating the same shit i have herd for the past eight/ twenty years by state owned terrorist broadcasting cartels like the BBC and toilet paper times opinion pages!
Do you even know where Ukraine is, why it happens there and what is going on really now there?!!! You make a statement like a person who loves itself for showing being kind careful.
 @Rocky Khurasani  only Pashtuns are warriors not you khorssanis
 @Who Is Him  kiev has been occupied by an illegitimate state backed militia with direct ties to the fourth reich! They publicly execute elected representatives of the ukranian people! Shot civilians and fire bombed police officers during peaceful protests when the electorate chose not to join the eu like greece.An american bank loaned greece 300 billion to join the e.u. but all they where interested in was acquiring political control over the 400k army. Then called in the debt causing the economy to go into free fall! Now syrian boy who where convinced they would be safe in europe live on the streets prostituting them selves to survive.You swore an oath to a political regime at the ballot box...you don't have an opinion! You are told what to think! How to act and what to do. But following orders will not save you from prosecution. Though the ukraine has the most secure black market in the world. If you want a nuke they can get it for you, a dirty bomb...
 @Tania Benischke  why pray? it clearly doesnt work
I'm natural sound positive energy natural video atmosphere villages I love you 🌹🍇🐔🐓🏃💪🐈🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
 @get high  USA has invaded so many, you say nothing. Don't you have a shame parading your hypocrisy?
 @IAM HARDWELL  Oh, we know them well.
 @Lena cy  CRIMEA was part of RUSSIA and given to the UKRAINE.Sorry, PUTIN just asked it back.
this is serious, and i'm not sayin' who between Russia or ukraine have right, i'm sayin that for the people that live in ukraine is horrible that, they lost thei're home and loves one, i'm wonder what's gonna happen the next days
This may be WW3 the civilian said
Im crying my Grand parents live there😭😭
President putin claims to be a man of God but as seeming like the Antichrist in the Bible it says Thou shalt not kill and that we should bring peace not war what have you done you brought nothing but chaos and War destruction and bloodshed in God's Kingdom shame on you may God have mercy on your soul
Fear for his job? A lot more than losing just his job he needs to fear
PRAY FOR UKRAINA #СлаваУкраине #Ukraini #saveukraine #изпутиниз
I hope the west won't do any appeasement this time. Last time they let a certain psychopath annex a country it didn't end well.
The Russian army is a bit occupied right now, why don’t they simply mass riot
Llana... come to South Africa - it's safe and far away from the madness.
Putin You show the true colors. What do you mean self defense? What do your mean Ukraine will attack Russia? WTF! your Paranoid! 😡
I am currently in lockdown
For now they have to agree for Russian demands
LONG LIVE RUSSIA! FUCK uk and usa!!!!!!!
If nothing is done about this then Lituania Poland and Estonia are next!
Support for Russia 🇷🇺 🇪🇹
America probably needs to do a Soleimani on Putin in Moscow in broad daylight. But if the Russians can retaliate then that probably wouldn't happen.*
Emergency
It's quite laughably disheartening to read the comments these days in most serious or important news videos on youtube! So much emotionally driven ignorance by keyboard commandos!!!!!! Yup, this world is doomed! The future looks incredibly bleak! :(
My heart goes to the Ukrainians from East Africa 🇰🇪. Clearly the Russians do not want the war. This is Putin's war.
Fuck Serbia and Russia! Nobody loves you in Balkans, Batlics, and Ukraine. Putin = Milosevic
Nazi
What's wrong with Putin, how can anyone become such a monster?
War is horrible and no body can remain untouched but Ukraine leadership has to take responsibility for this, being part of Soviet union for such a long and understanding how it work,it underestimate Russia and it's dictator (Putin),why such a hurry to be part of west and Nato(which cannot came for help),now Putin will make sure that it won't happen for another 50 years. For 30 years Russia allowed Ukraine to function as independent country(It even paid for former Soviet military equipment) but 2014 demonstration fuel distrust and westernization of Ukraine further created security concern for Russia (geniune or not it depends on perspective of different camp)and being large European country with unfriendly leadership,russian red line was cross,if you look from strategic point of view,it logical for russian to neutralize the danger (which it perceive as real) because if Ukraine would have join nato,nato would have got large country as buffer between actual major European Power and future conflict (if any) between nato and Russia would have taken place in Ukraine and eastern Europe,which would give advantage to Nato and disadvantages for Russia to reach proper Europe,since it would have required double the military and other resources and would have encountered hardened resistance(from NATO), than what it will encounter now,hence the current action
Our coward country just watching the slaughter.
Putin is such an evil
Putin is a very very short bald man with tiny feet  probably swings both ways and is now as popular as cancer. My Heart is with the Ukrainian people
In democracy you can freely say what you want.
Very love to all Ukrainian needs to be my grateful power. 🇫🇴🇮🇸🇸🇪🇫🇮🇳🇴🇩🇰🇦🇽💖🇺🇦💪
Not sure if this is how the world watched Germany invaded Poland back then.
STOP TERRORIZING UKRAINE 🇺🇦 STOP ✋️ killing innocent people 😤 SORRY FOR UKRAINE 😢
Can anyone explain why diplomacy has failed? It always take two to tango!
Putin takes Ukraine then where next ? Poland? And then from there?? Putin is a coward & a liar - a pathetic weasel who must be stopped at all costs.
Where's the full scale invasion??? 😂😂😂 Media such lying scum
Praying for all of Ukrainians from india 🇮🇳
This is truly the sequel to the year 2020
where’s is Nato  sleep ?
This manic, mass murderer, genocide, must be put down for the sake of the Ukrainian people and the rest of Europe.
So when Ukraine wants to be independent its fine, but when those regions like Dontesk do not want to be a part of Ukraine and be independent, its wrong? Ah the hypocrisy
FUCK THE UKRAINE MIND YOUR BUSINESS AND START FIXING OUR OWN BOARDER PROBLEMS NOW YOU PIECES OF DOG SHIT
Yep, he wants to destroy your country because he feels what your country is doing will destroy his country and you think it’s funny.
Well someone made a decision after 5 years
Pray for our world. The globalist poked the bear.
So all Russians are against the war, is that really what the BBC wants us to believe? On RT and CGTN is a more balance interview, with both for and against given air time.
Well, this is the consequence of your foolish actions. I hope NATO learn from this.
They destroyed Syria , Iraq , Afghanistan .Now they are destroying themselves. What an irony.
Greed for Power.
Stay strong Ukraine ✊ 
Nazi russia knows only how to steal and murder!
Horrible! Innocent lives adults children elderly the animals will all be affected by this horrible horrible man.
Ukraine didn't sign peace agreements this is what happens.... no one talking about the dead Russians
I hope all the Russian money that is in the UK is frozen.For too long they have used the UK to filter its finances through football clubs and other businesses.
Just looking through the screen it is hella depressive.Can't imagine the fear Ukrainians are living with.
Sickening
Ukr thất thủ
Why aim a rocket at innocent people, that's is what i dont get...like a gang war, that indirectly gets the job done.
Ukrainian People already admitted defeat!  That's very shameful!  Fight, take guns, defend your country, your land, house, children, parents! 💪👏 Support from 🇧🇩Bangladesh!
Bruh i wanna go back to 2021
What's our American soft serve president gonna do now?
Let there be peace ✌ 🙏 😌 Love and prayers to the both leaders to think wisely . From Nagaland

You don't understand this.
 @Tacito Zetticci  we fought against Pakistan in 1971 and we won. I can relate..
Millions of Ukranians actually want to go back to being part of Russia.Remember they got separated from it only 30 years ago, because the USSR was destroyed. The adults remember what it felt like to be part of a big powerful country, but then it was all gone.Now they're stuck with their mediocre politicians, their bad economy and public organisation, their weakness in the international stage.Millions of them hate what this new 
 @Tacito Zetticci  I don't think so majority of the ukrainian wants to be part of Russia. Otherwise they didn’t protest and brought down the russian puppet president few years back. Except some regions where Russia influence exist otherwise i can say 80% don't want to be part of any country. And want to be a democratic independent nation. Russia is not a democratic country!
when your enemy says it won't attack and it does, concede a shocked Pikachu face -Sun Tzu
What the hell is nato doing ? What the hell is UN doing ? ... Just sitting and eating away resources and our money ..  😑
Ukrainian president should drop arms and rejoin the Soviet Union
Bro wtf Fr
Ukraine for God Sake! U must make peace to Putin not in Nato coz at the end of the day u are part of Soviet union u belong to Russia not USA!.🙏
Pls pray for Ukrine  🙏🏻🙏🏻✌️🙏🏻✌️🌻💕💞💓😇🦅
The low life ukraine president is hiding in his bunker like a b!+€#
NATO did this. Ukraine is a corrupt country
He said it may be WW3
Come on Ukrainian government declare war on Russia don’t take this sitting down. If you don’t retaliate you will be bullied, if you start war western leaders will be forced to step in
Wow....nazificatio ..what a word
They’re going for the airports first to disable their measly Air Force
Stand with Ukraine 🇺🇸 🇺🇦
OMG! My heart hurts for the people of Ukraine. Unfortunately, citizens are the ones who will suffer and die for Putin's desires. Why doesn't Putin care about the Nazi's in his own country?
Do not let Biden and his idiots push you to war. Biden probably had those explosives set to start this war. Putin doesn’t appear to be afraid to say what’s what. This just doesn’t add up.
This is disgusting, Russia go to hell!
Thanks for NATO and US, thanks for all your provocations.And now, you'll do nothing
West is responsible for all the deaths stop fueling the fire
This is a day of pain. The cruel ambition of one person inflicts terror and violence on tens of millions, and pushes the whole of humanity towards disaster. We are right on the edge of the abyss. If aggression triumphs, the whole world will be engulfed by a new era of war, and we might not see the end of this era in our lifetime. The future of all of us now depends on the bravery of the Ukrainian people. It is our duty to support them.
Russia is not a country
Stfu.  It's all planed it's all scripted
Stfu this is all scripted it's all planned. They pretend to fight each other but in the end they all are involved in it.

Its bcoz of west provocation and corruption of zelensky ... people of Ukrain will feel safe now
Yo what kinda headlights are on that mustang tho ?
Putin is the biggest threat to peace.
Wheres biden? What's taking biden so long?  You mean sanctions dont work on Putin..? What..?
the US pops in then Neucler war will start
ughhhh. so frustrating. so unnecessary.
1:17 Civilian? LOL. Are you THAT stupid or just blatantly lying?
FCK the democratic world
You western peoplle,you dont know nothing,this is war you created again,yours goverments and you are just listening to their lies.This is war beetwen two Slavic people what the west really want to achive and they did.Russia is not small Yugoslavi which 19 nato countries bombed,with no permisson of UN,fuck you west scum,peace for Slavic people
It looks dramatic,  and it is. But reality is that ukranians are holding. There is no quick progress for russians and they already dying. It is a good sign,  as the cost of invasion is growing.At this moment people of Ukraine are the only force that can stop Russia.  But our countries must make sure that Russian economy gets damaged permanently. They must nor recover and become threat to anyone ever again. Stop any trade.
Old russian woman voice: not good russia not good
This is amazing to see

The Ukraine is not a democratic country.
Hate that our people of the same heritage is fighting. Being brewing for 30 years, if the US could just fckoff all would be better.
This is already said in the Bible . Matthew 24.Please repent.Jesus is coming soon 🙏🙏
Fighting for peace will cause war..
I’m so confused as to why Ukraine did not prepare for this.
I doubt Ukraine will resiliently fight it out, after all they're blood brothers. Ukraine is a former Soviet, even selling China it's first aircraft carrier and with it the technology. Why not the West leave them as it is? Is it because the US is also eager to test their latest weaponry? Good luck to the players then.
Ukraine is not a place, it's the people, and if anyone wants to 'occupy' Ukraine and make it their own, then if you don't plan to kill every single Ukranian, that's never going to happen!!Long live Ukraine people!!!!
THe only nazis here russians.
I know Russian citizens do not like the war, but how BBC reporter asked the lady to cry for the camera...😆😆WOW! Propaganda masters - BBC 😂😂
F#€k ukraine!!😂
Putin  I order you to stop this war.🤬🤬🤬🤬😡
Oh shoot white people fighting white people.
The Ukrainian army is fighting with the Russian aggressor. Russian planes and helicopters were shot down, tanks were destroyed.  Russian troops are trying to capture the Chernobyl plant in order to blow it up.We ask for sanctions against all Russian banks.I ask the EU countries and Britain Canada to take the wounded soldiers to their hospitals at your expense. Send medical supplies for the wounded!Ruh party leader Serhiy Doroshenko
America's military is at its weakest.....America's enemies will strike
Whoever is doing the thumbnails should get a pay raise😂
NATO - No Action Talk Only


De Nazification of Ukraine!??? Putin, Fascist dictator vs democratically elected Ukrainian government. If Putin wants to de-nazify Ukraine he needs to Fuck off back to Moscow. Long live Ukraine and to hell with Putin and his murderous regime. The Russian people don't want this war and they will overthrow Putin once they see their boys coming home as dog food.
Sanctions wouldn`t have stopped Hitler either, because he too was a megalomaniac.
Nato have to stop this.
Russia will pay dearly for what they have done.
People are taking shelter underground? It looks like they’re calmly walking to and fro, using the subway system per usual…

I wonder when the first atomic bomb is sent off, feels inevitable at this point. He’s considering every option.
Putin is a nut case to think Ukraine is a threat to Russia
EU no borders USA current regime no borders Why so concerned about Ukrainian borders ???Exposes their agenda of disinformation on open borders.
What will the world do about this??? Nothing but sanctions.... what a joke
Looks like western media was correct after all😏..russia was going to invade..again
God you are in control
Pandemic, WW3, i love my Generation .......
War has never done good to anyone except for horror and terror to humanity. Innocent civilians gets killed who has nothing to do with politics, all they wish is to live peacefully happy with their loved ones. May Allah safe the innocent civilians Ameen
It is real because of some politicians who don't care about regular people. U.S should mind their own business and not push this to the extreme. I don't say Putin is right, but I understand his madness.. U.S should see what they did in many places around the globe. They talk about democracy, but the fight is not taking place on their field. What will they do to stop this ? Nothing..And somehow I think the truth is being shared between all of them, behind the closed doors.Someone from Eastern Europe..
God save Ukraine
We stand  with Ukraine......
Ukraine’s sovereignty ended in 2014 when the US overthrew its democratically elected leader in an illegal coup and installed a puppet gov’tAt least 13,000 people have died in fighting since then in a war fueled by US weapons and neo Nazi militias. This war did not begin tonight
Weh them a war fah!!!sigh
LongLiveHumanity
Suddenly World Power is shifting from America, America need a president like Trump at a time like this
It’s not self defense when you march up to a countries border and start firing missiles you putz
Politicians make me sick. Start war for power and money, they have no hearts or souls by killing innocent people while they are protected.
Before the attack....US and UK....Say that Ukrainia will be protected by NATO..... So....where there are now.....😢😢😢
Horrible, horrible and there will be NO winners only the innocent will die and face hardship.
Good. I hope they flatten nazi ukraine
Haven't we learnt from the past.
Noone should be surprised by this.....of course Putin was gonna do this the writing has been on the wall for weeks and all Biden and Boris can do is Sanctions. And Nato holds talks. Putin is having a laugh  right now. So so sad.
Only warning no action from the west!!
Enough Sanctions, we need more Actions! Someone should drop a bomb on Kremlin - that would be good for a start  (actually, it should have been done some 10 years ago...). Otherwise, #WWIII is upon us. #killPutin and stop just meeting, talking, sanctioning - Putin shovels those sanctions up his ass.
We should be there helping them what good are weapons if they are all dead and cant use them NATO should be there
Jah jah good gosh man when will all this madness stop sigh
NATO's open door policy has transformed Ukrainians into refugees. Was this NATO's plan? Wicked people
Glory to Ukraine!
Finally nazis will be stopped
Solidarity with Ukraine. I would boycott Russian goods but they don't make anything of use except death
PRAYERS OF GODS HEDGE OF PROTECTION
This is very very fishy.Notice how there’s no actual footage of the Russians attacking anything.Just random explosions and claims that it’s the Russians.Hasn’t anyone got a smart phone.

Prayers to all affected from south africa
God Bless the Ukraine 🇺🇦
Please leave innocent people 🙏 😥
trump is a traitor
Someone ask : 
“This was for self defence”Begins to target civilians
Imagine being a kid and waking up to that air siren and hearing those explosions jeez.
THEM PICTURES COULD B FROM IRAC SYRIA WHO KNOWS   YEARS OLD MAYBE
Russia is just a bully
They built it and then destroy it..
This war will be over quick, Ukrainian military has been caught sleeping
Stop being Bully Vladimir
Vladimir Putin has revealed himself to be just another psychotic dictator no different than Adolf Hitler or Joseph Stalin. NATO and the USA must get involved and drive Russian forces out of Ukraine. Everything stated by Putin about this conflict is a lie. Putin provoked this conflict, stole Crimea from Ukraine, and is now fighting an unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine. Vladimir Putin and his henchmen need to be removed from power and tried for war crimes.
I am very sad to see what is happening to this world. I'm not Ukrainian but I really want to stand up and fight for you, but I really don't want war. Isn't the epidemic enough to cause us pain? I just hope that Ukraine will be safe and from now on there will be no more wars, big or small in the world.
कोई तो होगा जो इसे रोक ले
War is Neanderthal…..Prayers for everyone….
Zašto brate Putine? ZAŠTO???

Yeah i experienced exactly that when NATO criminals attacked and bombed my country 😖
 @СРБIN  I'm from Denmark and i know NATO isn't innocent.

 @Olivers Klay  lol
History reapets itself.
I DIDNT IMAGINE THAT. I LIVED THAT. with my eyes i was watching NATO missiles FLYING FROM ITALY in 1999 and hitting buildings. I was there on my roof HOPELESSLY watching terroristic missiles hitting my town and i cried. Big support for Russian brothers,i hope Ukrain people will learn lesson this time and stop suporting sa7anistic organisation called NATO.
ok now that scary

Z world. :D TV War....distractions from 5th session of the Grand Jury Proceedings.
 @Tupac Amaru Shakur  lmaooooooo
 @Tupac Amaru Shakur  im sure those residencial areas on fire contributed to disarming ukraine
I experienced it in 2003.. It was hard to fall asleep wondering if our house would get hit next. I’ll never forget the sounds.
did these people stand up for Iraq , libiya , Afghanistan when US is invading those countries , why now , go and sleep you cowards
I have been through that exact situation you described during bombing of Serbia in 1999. I was 14y old and it was absolutely surreal .
Residents of Kiev after 8 years of bombing houses Donbass were surprised to find out that this game can be played together.
Murder! No other word fits. Putin is out of his mind.
F U LADY. LIBERTY NEVER EVER SURRENDERS. YOU RUSSIANS WHO DEFEATED THE WERMACHT HAVE BECOME SHEEP AND CATTLE. LET PUTIN GO CRAZY AS LONG AS I HAVE BREAD ??  BY NEXT WINTER THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE WILL BE STARVING. JUST WATCH. HEY UKRAINE— DROP A COMMIE FOR CHRIST FOR ME. SHALOM
If NATO and USA push Russia to the brink then this is what you get. Europe for europeans! It is the media that makes it worst!
This is a hard lesson for the west and OTAN, don't wake a sleeping lion!!If you think sanctions will weaken Russia. Think again!🇷🇺
NATO has been expanding towards Russia's borders for far too long, someone like Putin definitely would take action soon enough. Still this is horrible and I feel for the citizens of Ukraine and Russia. The elites gather in their suits in comfortable rooms and send their citizens to die for dumb reasons.
Airports, power stations, weapons depot, military bases, TV / Radio stations, large freeways, etc - All the tools that could be used to fight back.Stay away from those and you'll be fine.Civilians are not Putin's targets.
The first anti-Christ was Napoleon, a small man.  The second was Hitler, also a small man.  Now Putin comes along, another small man.  Makes me wonder...
Этот черный человек слишком много разговаривает, пусть едет в свою страну, если хочет спокойно разговариватьThis black man talks too much, let him go to his country if he wants to talk calmly
If NATO doesn't help, many Ukrainians die.If NATO helps, WW3 begins.Folks, what are we going to do about this?
This is World War III ?

No one can stop Vladimir Putin only same same thing as Hiroshima.
The BBC Propaganda machine in action.
As Russian media claims 
Nato pushed too far to the east.  Provoking Russia.
Only way this world can move forward is by a major reset it has to be done regardless of it sounds bad or ugly there's no point spending all the people money on the military if we not gonna use it
Where's covid tho? All over suddenly????
क्या सैनिक भी पढ़े लिखे गवारो की बात मन लेते है
barbaric shit. killing civilians and calling it defensive.
He has nuclear missles now common these baby missles show us some real missles
Remember what Jesus said 2000 years ago...in the book of Mark13:7,8.
Ukrainian give up nuclear weapons for the world，the world didn't treat her well.
I like how this news propaganda hitting in emotions 🤣🤣🤣 where you were when Russian civilians were under the constant bombardment of Naza fractions that occupied Ukraine from the inside?  You are redicilous and really, really, really sick!
Shame on you BBC, the same Americans are doing all over the world 🌎. Feel sorry for the people of Ukraine 🇺🇦 😢
Not good russia not good
Go RUSSIA !!! SUPPORT FROM SERBIA !!!
NATO is to blame for everything. NATO also started the war in Yugoslavia. Everything would be under control if there is no NATO
Much respect for Boris Johnson finally he called correct dictators of Russia POOtin as a dictator of Russia! Stay Strong Ukraine!
Ukrainians my brothers, I pray for you and your country,  stay safe, stay strong, this insane war should be over soon. God bless you  all. Russians end this madness now please. Courage brothers.
He said she said. Lol
While theres a war going on im here stuck in school
What are they waiting to strike back?
another syria, a proxy war between 2 powers.
Why BBC not talking about that ukrainien army attacks Dontensk and Lugansk. And it was for long time past 8 years. Nobody talking about that. Why nobody talk about USA military In Irak, Livia, Afghanistan, Jugaslavia? USA army crashed every country
So Russia is just a Rogue terrorist nation now. Time to pay attention to who still works with them. NATO needs to be funneling in anti air and anti tank artillery.  When they start losing expensive equipment Russia would stop real quick. They are only attacking because they know Ukraine is technologically limited.

What a evil army to be invaded by….. poor civilians
Kremlin disinfo working its magic on you.
Not good russia not good
Americans and Europeans stop crying your leaders are the main reason for this war
what about palestine..where was the media when innocent palestenians died by israelis..every war should be condemned...i hope sanity will prevail
Rukja putinder
The new Hitler,
Regime change incoming just like Libiya Iraq and Yugoslavia
I feel NATO is just a ruse to defend America and that's it. What a joke, they courted Ukraine for years but when things get real NATO just watches.
NATO must do something to protect Ukraine 🇺🇦 not only sitting in office and said sanctions
Prayers and Spiritual support from Nepal🇳🇵🇳🇵. Hope this war will stop somehow.
Godbless the Ukrainian people and citizens and everyone on the front line
We are with Ukrainian people but not with the faking west who caused this.
So unfair how innocent people are the ones affected most by these types of things
Ужасно видеть заинтересованного чумазого чернокожего чёрта на фоне русских святынь киевской Лавры.
A little too late to evacuate.
Bomb russia
This is why you don't give up your nukes
Go Russia
This is not good
Praying for piece? Well god doesnt exist so...
The whole world just going to sit and watch this mad man destroy a whole country? Where are all the  world leaders in this?
How is this self-defense Putin?
many democracies have laws that rebel against the laws in the bible therefore people deserve to be destroyed
Why is this still a thing! Why would anyone want to kill so many people!?! These people are so damn SICK!!!!!!
Ukraine must not join nato
Defensive? Who does he think he is kidding? Once Putin finishes wiping out Ukraine, who is next on his list of countries that he believes make it impossible for Russia to 'feel safe, develop and exist' due to  the 'constant threat emanating from them'?  As for the people in Belarus who allowed Putin to use their country to invade Ukraine, the blood of innocent people is on your hands.
US is counting money flowing out of Europe into US .  Where money flow to, tell the truth.
I believe America is involved.  The Dirty democrats.  Rush wants there ports. An America wants his oil. Think about it.
God bless Ukraine and Ukrainians😢😢😢😢😢😢
Is usa afraid to stop russia after all the talk. please help Ukraine!!!
0:26 Terrifying
Nazis get what they deserve.
And here we thought humans have evolved after all those wars.
I remember how helpless the Serbian people were enduring weeks of non-stop NATO bombardment back in 1999. I had friends and family scared out of their wits hunkered in basements while NATO attacked Serbia.
Im really afraid of the outcoming of this war...its unaceptable what Putin is doing and its unaceptable that we do not help Ukraine. The problem is to fight a crazy, narcisist that doesnt have no respect for human life and its very dangerous to fight agains someone like Putin...i wish Russian people could have the willing to remove Putin.
सभी पढ़े लिखे ही लड़ रहे है
Putin doesn't want to hurt the people....he just wants to stop the possibility of Ukraine joining NATO...NATO is Corrupt.
🇱🇻🇱🇻🇱🇻🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
UK and America been killing people for last 20 years darling
https://youtube.com/shorts/eCgMVNeko9g?feature=share
Killing people or military bases?
Thanks to America putting puppets everywhere
 @Patrick Mulholland  there’s a clear difference between killing armed terrorists who attacked us first, and killing random civilians at an airport.
 @Certified Apeist  so the US invaded Iraq, Syria and Libya because they had terrorists that attacked us first?
 @Patrick Mulholland  Oh yeah? You mean against people like the Taliban? Did you see the people clambering to find any way out of that country when we stopped 
 @Patrick Mulholland  So HaS EvErY OtHeR CoUntRy. Instead of pointing fingers at useless nations, how about we all just look in the mirror sweet pea.
 @Certified Apeist  Ha. You muppet. Typical reply by someone who has never seen it. The US kills civilians all the time in drone strikes. Claiming they hit a 
 @namaan123  yes indeed- lil baby
And they rule the world, crazy isn't it?!
 @Brian Williams  the Americans funded the Taliban during the soviet afghan war
Its NATO's fault. Don't for get that
Western countries must withdraw Ukraine immediately from the list of NATO. This all could have been avoided. Putin has no choice but to react this way.
 @Brian Williams  funny how before the collapse of the USSR there wasn’t any Islamic extremism
Sick in the head
 @Brian Williams  yeah I'm deluded bro, Back to your CNN
This is bound to happen...what do you expect???? This world is fallen no matter what we do it is unfixable... climate change, wars, famine , people against people, poverty, pandemics..etc etc..
 @Brian Williams  America created the Taliban and isis. The U.S didn’t need to be in Vietnam, Iraq, or Afghanistan, but we armed their forces and labeled them terrorist so we could prophet.
 @TAGB1  This video is about russians killing ukranians, în case you haven't noticed.
@Certified Apeist whoa dude, you just crossed the line... Stop man, this ain't like this. I'm against all of this, but it's true that Irak, Afganistan and Siria wasn't the best time in the world for USA. It has also done a few other bad moves during Cold War...But same with URSS.
 @maniackyjr  well, if history is a joke to you, then keep laughing
??? So your comparing the civilian casualties that are not exactly intended by the US government (mind you in hostile territory where terrorists were known to hide as civilians only to run out and kill innocent soldiers) to the absolute bombardment of a civilian airport in Ukraine? Do you hear yourself right now? Wow it’s truly a shame people choose to be this ignorant in a world with so much information readily available at our fingertips.
 @ティムTim™  Course he doesn't have a choice. God Himself has put the attack orders on his table and told him 
 @GimmeSloppySenpi  profit*
 @Certified Apeist  
 @Patrick Mulholland  Yeah you are deluded. BTW I havent watched television for 21 years (not that we even get CNN here) so good luck with that theory. What ever significance you think it has.
 @namaan123  stop actin like a lil baby
🥺🥺🥺😭😭😭
Despicable of Putin to do this! Absolutely unprovoked!
So war ?
Why they didn't shot down the jet
ones you provoke big brother for 8 years you get what you asked for.... Ukrainian people killed Russians for years
I think Russia is saying see how it feel to have missles and Bombs by you this how Russia woulda felt if Ukraine joined nato .. Russia didn’t want Ukraine to join because it was so close to Russia ….. I mean pretty simple
This had  a different phrase when US  Invade irak and afghan
Anyone, spreading hatred and taking lives of innocent civilians for their personal interests is cursable.
Russia is playing with fire. If America and NATO forces begin counter then WW3 will begin
holy shit i got such heavy half life 2 vibes from that  beginning clip.... crazy
Where is NATO??tell me
UK is one of the country that added gas on this flame ... Instead of a solution they were sending antitank missiles to Ukraine ..... Now Russia is attacking where are all these countries
Stop the bloody war Russia... wTf are you doing man... out of your mind
Why war I don't understand...
fireball jitsu
Russian military are filled with cowards. The Generals that follow Putin are cowards. This is wrong on all levels.
Look, Ukraine had eight years to make peace with itself. But they chose to continue to shell homes in Donbass constantly. This is obviously not an invasion. The invasion narrative is nonsense. This is an intervention designed to decisively put an end to the war launched against Donbass. We will see peace soon. Russia will never occupy Ukraine.
The west needs to crush them economically
Putin will get what's coming to him
we want world peace ☮️
Your comment doesn't make ANY sense to me. How could, and why would, Ukraine 
russia ❤️
दुनिया में शिक्षा का कोई महत्व ही नही दिखाई दे रहा
Putin is war criminal time for the us to take him out
The fact that the American Millitary and government is going to do nothing about it is extremely sickening
this is only the beginning and it wont stop with ukraine cause we are heading for multi polar world and sanctions dont do shit.we might as well see china attacking taiwan too.
My heart is crying for Ukraine people who lost their families and homes😭😭😔
This is total responsibilities the USA political leader!!!
Can someone explain to me what Russia wants with Ukraine?
Even a dog won't kill another dog, only suffered knows the real pain. May God bless everyone
Russia patients ran out, look what happened,  Ukraine and the West keep poking them , now Ukraine had to bare the consequences,  Ukraine current president is most incompetent ever, a movies star become president with no politic knowledge ruins the entire nation.
Hoteli so vojno in sedaj jo imajo!
Prayers for russia
FOR THE LAST 2 OR 3 MONTHS  NEARLEY EVERY COMMENT HAD GOOD THINGS TO SAY ABOUT PUTIN  . OF COURSE THAT HAD TO BE CHANGED ?
go gerilla warfare!! buy some time and you can win!! it seems like the only solution to me....and meanwhile lets see EU and USA answers for the invasion
There are no winners in war 😢😢😢😢
No he wants thr NAZI party out.the corrupt goverment
Godbless all from CANADA
Wish you took stand with Palestine 🇵🇸 too. My best wishes for Ukrainians and Ukrain. ❤️

Let’s put Russia in her place and get this over with. He’s not stopping with Ukraine, they didn’t believe hitler would take more than Poland once upon a time
just get the bank of england to print another 2 trillion, and pay the russians off ? problem resolved.
This is bullshit what a load of crock.. This smells just like when the us staged 9/11 or blamed Iraq for weapons of mass destruction.. Mark my words in the coming months the truth will come out yet again.. And yet again you will all choose to ignore it and carry on blindly following the same narratives  over and over.. Notice how many times the words seems, may have, reported to of are used.. Nothing a out fact or certainty pure bs as usual
Puntin is as bad as hitler!! My love goes out to everyone there ❤️ De-natzifi Russia and drive towards peace ✌️ a 3rd world war is coming 😳
I know Ukraine isn't part of NATO but a lot of the countries close by are. Too bad they didn't pay their 2% GDP for defense like your supposed too. It will your fault when Russia takes your country. American money and American lives should not help until they do their part.  This is why Trump was pushing for NATO to be fair. Too many countries depend on our military.
Send Russians back to Russia.
Ukrain you better surrender your bitcha assss, we Russians don’t give a fuck. Surrender before it’s too late ….we share similarities, it’s ok
i am really saddens by this but i pray the people of Ukraine and Russia the civilians are the ones who will pay the price. my prayers are with you love from jamaica. i am crying right now.
... the NATO membership is the problem, nothing else.
NATO must intervene with air and land forcesPutin is INSANE and this invasion must be STOPPED nowNo more pointless waffleClose the gas pipelinesClose the oil pipelinesSmash the Russian militaryNuke the kremlin Stop this madness IMMEDIATELY
Tsar bomb incoming
Wonder what happens next. Do you think they'll stop after the Ukraine ??? Or will he go further
It's always the civilians who pay the price for these power hungry tyrants.  You are in our thoughts ❤
Stay strong Ukraine 🇺🇦 💙🇧🇦
Where are the rebels! M********** ain't going to fight for their houses and they homes ain't none of the residents or citizens civilian's armed? And do any of them have the balls the pop a shot at one of them Dick head's?
When you realize what is really going on in Ukraine you would be on Russia's side...
All Africa people with Russia 🇰🇪🇪🇹🇸🇴🇪🇷 ❤❤❤🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺....our prayers to our Ukrainian brothers and sisters but F NATO and the west....trying to sacrifice millions for power 🇷🇺🇷🇺Russia wining this
As all of Europe sits home and watches on their TVs.
Yea unfortunately that’s what was due to happen. US and NATO should not get involved on this, at least the US it’s not our war

Absolutely horroble
Damn, an airport
Nostradamus predict putin death... he will be assisinated...this year or next year
So sad i said to my wife a year or so ago after covid there will be a war i fear that this maybe just the beginning
This is absolutely WW3
Notice how they say this is all unverified 👁 footage it's propaganda

BIDEN AND NATO MEMBER THEY DIDNT KNOW WHATS PUTIN IN MIND. EVEN YOU GIVE THE VERY BEST SANCTION AGAINT PUTIN IT DOESNT WORK YOU DONT KNOW WHATS PUTIN IN HIS MIND. LIKE I TOLD YOU , YOU DIDNT KNOW WHATS PLAN IN HIS MIND EVEN HE DECIDE 5 YEARS CONTINOUS  WAR IN UKRAINE. BIDEN AND ALL NATO MEMBER THET REALLY DONT KNOW WHATS IN PUTIN MIND.
so putin litteraly says ''drop your weapons and go home'' but then attacks the buildings that people call home?
Im Americani just hope i dont have to get my azz drafted to fight and die in some ridiculous foreign war
The world is on the threshold of a third world war. Wars unleashed by a madman for the sake of money and the lust for power. Threats from Russia to use nuclear weapons in case of disobedience is a direct threat to all life on the planet.
Fight back Ukraine dont grab your ankles for Putin like The GQP and  Donald Trump do!!!
De nazification aka deisraelify ukraine
I hope Putin's foreign bank accounts get frozen.
So funny with the Western and Americans. You can happily invade Libya, Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria with your lies, kill their people , but will cry fowl when Russia do the same to Ukraine. May Ukraine experience what Libya and other countries went through when they invaded with their media lies and propaganda to justify their military actions.
We as NATO we need to defend Ukraine defend our democracy
Why they don't translate properly what Putin said???
this is horrible for these people... caught in the middle of a game of thrones
US acting as slow poison for Russia,  Russia is protecting their future now
Ukraine were warned that this would happen for some time and they've made no effort to protect its civilians, boarders, infrastructure or military. Instead of fleeing their land and continuously calling this all a bluff, they now ask NATO to fight their war for them. Their politicians have massively let them down and made things very easy for Putin, alongside the country leaders of NATO too. They have done nothing since 2014 to grasp this situation.
Putin you rat 🐀 you make me sick invading war on innocent people  hope you get your comeuppance 😡
This is honestly terrifying, the buildings and streets in fire and destruction, the press having to wear special highlighting vests so they aren’t targeted? this is a nightmare
Holy shit this is a real thing?!
If we ALL dieITS RUSSIA'S FAULT!!!
Denazification??
That's how it used to be! The Ukrainian leadership, which cruelly oppresses the large-mouthed, genocidal minority by state means, is finally on trial for its actions !!!! I hope the many little dicks who let NATO jobs into their country get in their mouths !! The US play at home!rI’ve seen what Western “democracy” is like, if put to the test, there’s no democracy, even people’s money is stolen by greedy leadership.
Is Ukrainian army fighting? I haven't seen any Ukrainian air defenses or missiles firing at Russians in the news.
War crimes
Mistake(US conspiracy) done by Ukraine, beneficiary will be USA ,  Europe will be suffered
Ukraine should launch missiles into Russia. Make Putin and the Russians suffer just like the Ukrainian's are. USA and Nato should furnish every weapon needed to win this war for Ukraine and freedom. If not, we will face a larger and stronger Russia just down the road .
Beautiful brave Ukrainian people.
Putin is in the 🏠 😁
Pray for Ukraine
Unbelievable Wicked West:Vladimir Putin it's second Hitler off the World:
Putin should be charged with war crimes
🙄 it's really not good  time for Ukraine
Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Russia must reign in the monster it has created.
PUTIN IS THE ONLY MAN HERE ! HE TOLD YOU TO GO THE FUK BACK FROM THE RUSSIEN BORDER YOU LOSERS
Stop    stop    stop  war  🙏
I ain't fighting for no world war only the war here in USA against the one's seeking power against us the ppl.
Go report about Palestine like this if u are good journalist
WOW i feel so bad for the citizens
Targeting the Ammunition supply, OMG!
Self defense?
love Putin...we are on your side
defence ? this guy is delusional
When will Ukraine finally start to defend itself??
US Europe NATO looks on....🤔
Things are not as they seem. They are certainly not as they are being reported. Do not trust the mainstream media.
Something straight out of a movie😦
Don't forget to do your West sponsored Maidan protest ,only thing no one will get overthrown now.
Nato sucks its a scam to get money 'they do nothing
My heart breaks for that couple with a toddler. I have a toddler myself. I can't begin to imagine how they are feeling right now. 😓
https://youtu.be/thADhg3M3yI
I felt for the innocent toddler too
Same.
Hitler #2
Be prepared NATO, u will be doomed very soon.
Zelensky needs to talk to Putin and stop the war. UN, US and West enjoying peace, we need same for Ukrainians. Unfortunately, their president, Zelensky, has open ear for outside than his people
Mayby biden  will leave our military vehicles inside  Russia  l so Russia  will have more
Where USIA thay bark alot
Even if Putin targeting personnel that was involved into killings of russian speaking Ukrainians, war is the answer. Prays for Ukrainians on both sides of Ukraine.
Unverified images ehhhh
Looking at this, it seems that the future of each country is determined by how much national defense power is required when provoking other countries and who is selected for the leader of that country. Korea faces a million soldiers in the north, and China and Russia, as well as Japan, a war criminal country, are always tense and prepared for war. That's why young people are willing to serve in the military for two years. Without defense, Korea is also a 70-year truce country where war can break out at any time. What if Korea was weak in defense, hoping for unconditional help from the United States? It's terrible to think about it. There's something I don't understand as a Korean. Even though the whole world says economy and money are important, I don't know why they only want help from the U.S. Didn't you know Russia would do that? Why? Didn't they expect Russia to war at any time if it had its own destabilizing factors, such as Georgia in 2008 and the Crimean War in 2014? Before the United States had the honor of being the world's police, they were precious sons and daughters of Korea. The United States continues to send its soldiers to war? I wonder if Europe was complacent.
Not seeing many prayers nor tears for the people, who, less than 40 years ago were regarded as Soviet citizens and through no fault of their own are now regarded as Ukrainian. Clearly some of those people were quite happy to be Soviet, something I don’t think the “other” Ukrainians are equally happy with, and haven’t been happy with for about eight years now.
Fear fear fear fear. The US and Ukraine leaves Russia no choice but to defend his sovereignty. The Media isnt showing what Ukraine is done to Russia.
The International community needs to come to the aid of the Ukraine people now. If Putin is not stopped now, he will be coming to a town close to you soon.
Sorry for people 😞 of Ukraine 🇺🇦. Life is sacred stop the war. From Somalia 🇸🇴
Ukrainians really thought Russians were just hangin out at the borders.
oh yes this is bad oh no yes yes... MF's look at Chinese Uyghurs. Chinese Govt harvesting their organs from many years and there is Palestine, almost gone... literallyr eaten by Israel. most of middle east destroyed by US for oil but nope russia bad look at russia now
It’s bad for the U.K. because this will take the attention of boris being so BAD TO THE U.K. PUBLIC! And he will start using this as a distraction you heard it here first.
Time to send in the F-35s, the Wild Weasels and A-10s... with Putin's tanks significantly suppressed/incapacitated, it will come down entirely to infantry numbers and local knowledge == the Ukrainians will have a chance... 🇺🇦 ✌😐
Mother Russia forever  🪆
This the devils work..imagine innocent people dying..I feel sorry for this 🌎
Is nato going to do anything?
Nothing, what can ukraine do russia? Why does Ukrainian sovereignty not matter?
If you could elaborate or link something to it I would appreciate it. It’s kinda hard to find the story not told by main stream media
Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life.
Hence proved .. nato is a coward alliance.. can only gangup on weaker countries.
This is the consequence of the west/NATO's provocation. Why do we have missiles and military infrastructure in every European country bordering Russia? Why have we continually lied about expanding said infrastructure and increasing the proximity between them and Russia? Imagine if the US or UK had missiles pointed at them from just over the border? Utter hypocrisy from the west.
After weeks of calm this suddenly looks like panic? I'd say wisdom. Get the hell out of danger.
Ukrainian❤️brothers you're strong💪people! So you will succeed in liberating the country from the tyrannical invader. Hope you won't have to suffer for too long. The entire world is with you ❤️
Russia has every right to defend itself against NATOs aggressive moves like one that of including Ukraine into NATO.
🇷🇺◀️👊🏿🤬
Everyone is sad about this. No one was sad about lybia,syria,iraq ect. Oh yes that was ok,that is what USA says...
80% of Ukrainian want to be with Russia smh
What kills me is the Ukraine President downplayed Russia saying it won't happen and that the 
ww3
May god be with them 😪
What country is gonna help them
It is disgusting to see how the other powerful world super power countries can shameful just sit and watch how a country is being destroyed people killed. I hope there will be some retired individual to volunteer and help. #sanctionsalonecannotsaveUkraine
🙏🏻To the Ukrainian people  and those brave Russian souls, who dare to protest against this war.
Nazi Putin, on the loose.. 🤦‍♂️
This is what happens when you elect a bunch of liberal governments and task them with the defense of Europe. NATO is paper tiger and Russia/China know that.
This is horrible. My deepest condolences go to the family’s being affected by this horrendous situation.
Why is Ukraine just letting Russia in and not fighting back?

where have your hearts been for the past 8 years while western backed fourth reich gangs attacked east ukranians? The BBC are a state funded terrorist cartel!
 @Craig Scott  oh shut up you Russian bot lmao
 @Craig Scott  Oh sorry man that we feel bad for innocent people dying and being evacuated from their homes.. we must be making a mistake.
 @AaAaAaA  you have remained silent since the coup backed by the western fiscal states murdered elected representatives in public executions! The unelected kiev fourth reich gang have bombed thousands of children for the past 8 years.Away with you and your crocodile tears!Add to that the ukraine has thousands of old soviet weapons systems. A true and correct headline would be soviet missiles...not russian! And since the ukraine was the first signatory to the soviet union, ukranian missiles! There is no way russia did that! Like the tanks crossing the border...the military industrial complex would have disseminated satellite pictures to every global news desk within minuets!
 @Craig Scott  I don't give a shit about what you write, I will feel sorry for any innocent people getting evacuated and killed, I was a little kid by then and didn't know about the war, but I have every right to say I FEEL BAD FOR INNOCENT PEOPLE DYING BECAUSE OF WARS, everytime I see it, you can go fk yourself.
 @Craig Scott  Ok I feel sorry for those children bombed in the past 8 years too.. It doesn't mean that I shouldn't feel bad for innocent people that have nothing to do with war rn. I feel bad for all innocent people.
 @AaAaAaA  A famous author wrote, 
 @Craig Scott  Mate I really have no business to do with politics, I know that it's all messed up and some people benefit from wars and some not, I'm just saying, if I see kids crying because a war that has nothing to do with them, I'm gonna feel sorry for them, I don't need a reason to feel sorry, I will feel sorry if I see people scared and dying and leaving their homes because of politics and leaders,  I'm not feeling sorry for bad people, I'm feeling sorry for an 8 year old kid that's living there right now with fear instead of playing at school, and I have every right to express my feelings
 @AaAaAaA  politi: city. Metropolitan police, big city city... You swear an oath of allegiance to the foreign fiscal state, aka... the kingdom of northern ireland and imperial great britain at the ballot box. You gave up your right to have an opinion voting for the terrorist state!The parliament of great britain doesn't represent the people of the united kingdoms interests! It only deals with financial interest. ie, the bank of england act 1694 taxed alcoholic beverage to fund the war with france. Haulage act to tax commercial goods and services using the emergency powers act illegally since 1943. You don't  need a drivers licence or insurance...the fiscal state is the insurer of last resort, that is what it claimed to be. So much of that is not the intent of parliamentary minuets prior to legislation ratified (oh, it isn't ratified under u.k. legal statutes!)Ignorance of the law is no excuse! And following orders is no justification for committing crimes against humanity! I gave you the benefit of the doubt... you clearly have no interest in understanding anything about the current state of affairs.
 @Craig Scott  I don't understand a word, what do you want from me? Do you want me to say death to civillians? Or feel sorry for them? What do you want from me?
refugees?
I want to make it clear from the outset that with what I am going to say I am not defending or justifying what Russia has done, but I wonder what legitimacy does the United Kingdom have in demanding that international laws and the territorial integrity of nations be respected when the British have 15 colonies of the 17 that exist in the world, one of them in Spain, Gibraltar, being our supposed NATO allies and they skip the UNITED NATIONS resolutions for their decolonization every year? And it doesn't help me to hold a referendum with the 30,000 Gibraltarians since they are settlers placed by the English and the true population of Gibraltar are those of LA LINEA DE CADIZ. Or the United States that bypasses the UN resolutions and supports, finances and rearms the Moroccan dictatorship in the Sahara with the support of France, Germany and the United Kingdom. Why should Spain continue to support NATO and the European Union when our so-called allies have occupied Gibraltar and every year Europe gives away billions of euros to Morocco that they use to buy weapons from the United States and, on top of that, Ceuta and Melilla would not be protected by NATO? On top of that, the United States supported Morocco when the Moroccan Islamic dictatorship sent 10,000 Moroccan citizens to attack Ceuta and Europe did not impose any sanctions on them, Europe on top of giving them billions
Do your part, boycott anything Russian
F*** puttin
So were just going to let him 😞 We needed to be tougher than mere sanctions ! I hope the Russian people  see through his lies and remove him !
Ukraine is a sovereign good country! I hate it for all of you. Putin can go to hell!
We stand with you Ukraine
Putin flexing malitary muscle,it is humanity disaster just to gain a political post. So inhumane.
Oh Ukrainian NATO never help you. You help yourselves and fight for Motherland.
Haha 😂 where is the American baby?
It's the case in every country everywhere you look everywhere you turn it's either governments or social medias turning people on people with some agenda that is not understandable filled with lies and deception of course the common man does not support in a killing of another common man unless they're lunatics I don't really think anyone once any bloodshed but the powers to be certainly doesn't mind to see a little
Where is NATO there is a war... Irak, Sirya, Afganistan, Libya, Vietnam.........now Ukraine....
NATO IS WEAK....EUROPE IS WEAK.....AND IT WILL BE LEFT BY THE USA.....THE WORLD IS CHANGING....AMERICA HAVE NO FREINDS NO/ BUT STRATEGIC RELATIONS AND SHE WILL NEVER SAND TROOPS AND ENTER IN DIRECT WAR WITH A SUPER NUCLEAR POWER AS MOTHER RUSSIA......NEVER....EVER.....EUROPE MUST FACE THE NEW GAME RULES///// NOT BRITAIN BUT.....EUROPE//// NEXT STEP THE INVASION OF TAIWAN............AND STEAL NO WW3 WAR......IT WILL BE NEVER WW3 WAR BUT......EUROPE WAR//////////

Thanks I will buy more Russian products
No
Nimogu tvoj youtube otklucitj!!! :))) tlf slamalsia
We can't send nazis to fight nazis so we're waiting for the lgbq, feminist and oppressed people to go fight them. So far none have joined the cause
The world order has changed and the west has no choice but only to accept it.
So Russia can’t develop and feel safe while Ukraine develop to feel safe?
the west betrayed the Ukraine......
For medias this is lotto now
The argument that Putin is making about wanting buffers between him and his 
LOL at everyone acting shocked that Putin lied.
Should've de-Nazified Russia first.
Didn’t Ukrainian take out mh370
Stop Putin!!!!
has NATO started their effort to help ukraine? we need the US and the UK to step in NOW
Echoes of Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, Syria, etc. Copy book regime change.
My government united state please help the Ukrainian people
I mean if you're not trying to help yourself self why should others help you
#Putin is such a little man with a damaged and swollen ego. #USA, #Europe, all democratic nations must stop #Russia now!!!!
He is a vain person and looks like a pug
Like any of you people truly care, sitting on your couches watching the black box on the wall.. “oh my heart goes out” ok Karen don’t forget your hair appointment at 4 and your 12$ Starbucks coffee.
SIC SEMPER TYRANNIS SIC SEMPER TYRANNIS STAND FOR LIBERTY AND PEACE OR LET EVIL PROSPER BECAUSE GOOD MEN AND WOMEN DO NOTHING. INNOCENT WOMEN AND CHILDREN ARE GOING TO BE SLAUGHTERED. TODAY UKRAINE TOMORROW ANYWHERE A RU$$IAN TANK CAN ROLL ??
The world knows Ukraine can;t beat Russia....  Only option is to join Russia now to stop the war.
Don't give up Ukraine. ❤️ From India. Even Russian people will support you guys. Poor innocent people are suffering.
Prayers to these poor people,may god protect you.
looks like putin wants all of Ukraine 🤮🤮
THE WORLD MUST CONDEMN THIS INVASION OF RUSSIA THROUGH THE COMMAND OF PUTIN. THE WORLD MUST ACT AND MUST NOT ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN.
This channel is a joke all western bullshit Putin tryed he's be saying stop the Ukraine army to stop attacking the Russia people they did nothing but armed the with bigger and better weapons that's not helping but the the US for you Putin had to go in it's all NATO doing .why bring troops to Poland and other countries that surrounds Ukraine if your not going to do anything .this is what they always do before making something up and attack Russia and if that happens we can all say good bye Germany France all them be first just like that madness
Remember, no russian.
I don’t support Putin. But I don’t support the west either. They (the west) have invaded so many defenceless countries that they have lost their moral high ground. Rank hypocrisy.
Sorry for the family of Ukraine I hope will be safe :) I will pray both of you
Lmao columns of Russian armour.Totally not stolen from comment saying column of tanks 6 hours ago  (one of last ones I read before slept and this one of first videos after waking up) and totally not building things up more than they are.AND ITS SH1T RHETORIC AS COLUMN  VERTICAL!F the BBCYou have been caught creating false propaganda against Russia before with Reuters!
fake informations again. west hyprocrites morons.
So where is UN now,this time every country must prepare to defend themselves because, UN AND NATO ARE USELESS WHY SHOULD UN ALLOWED THIS TO HAPPEN TO THIS INNOCENT PEOPLE WITH ALL THIS CLEAR INDICATION THAT RUSSIA WAS GOING TO ATTACK UKRAINE. MAY GOD REMEMBER UKRAINE AND SAVE THEM FROM THIS ANTICHRIST PUTIN
Where is COD: Ghosts when you need them the most? 💀
And still we are talking and more talks.
Hmm I just watched DW news, Al Jazeera, RT TV  and 2 other non western media and there news reports are different. BBC, NBC and CNN has the same report.  Now I am confused.  Someone is lying and I cant find a way to verify which news is true...
Russians can't even protest the war because they will be thrown into jail by the dictator Putin/Hitler
My heart breaks for the people of Ukraine 🇺🇦.
So good always wanted to experience war. Bring on world war 3!!!
NATO must help. The world must help. No one must stall in helping the Ukraine. If Russia gets away with this, the effects will be everywhere. Putin must be stopped!
China, russia and north korea are the new hitlers.
putin is hitler from '38
https://youtu.be/thADhg3M3yI
What do you want NATO to do? UKR. is not a member and the UN is not military capability, you smarty, It's a peacekeeping mechanism, with who do you want them to talk diplomatically with? Little Pu or the nation on ill*terates that the Rurats are?
You have no idea who the Rurats are, I'm European and I know very well what a m*b of crim*nals they are! From Scandinavia to the East, there are nx1 nations that can tell you who the Rurats are.
Today they put their veil off their faces, but still pose as victims!
They were and will be a nat*on with r*duced int*llectual ab*lities, psychot*c and cr*m*nal! Rurats!
https://youtube.com/shorts/eCgMVNeko9g?feature=share
I’m a bit upset too how could Putin do such a thing he’s attacking innocent people what has Ukraine done to Russia that is this serious? Stupid Putin I just hope we don’t have to fight against Russia
Pray for piece in Ukraine 🙏
 @NiiiiiintendoGuy51  Ill explain 30% of Ukrainians are actually ethnic  Russians who also speak Russians 2 : NATO wants to expands into Ukraine Russia said no ......😜😜😜🤣🤣🤣😝😝😝
 @NiiiiiintendoGuy51  Why don't you all try looking up the history of it. If you can read look up the articles linked to John Pilger's twitter account. He's been reporting on wars for nearly 60 years. You don't need a twitter account to read it.
PUTIN is supporting FREEDOM AND THE INDEPENDENCE of Eastern Ukraine.You guys shamelessly support separatists in Taiwan and yet whining about what Putin is doing in the Ukraine. Pathetic.
 @Kumar Ramishin  the 
Peace will never come as long as Ukraine join NATO FORCE .How would USA feel if Russia starts to join forces with USA Neighbours ???I don't understand why USA/NATO had to build defensive forces on Russia Neighbouring Countries .Face the consequence now 🤦
So you dont care about any Russians losing their lives???
 @Demicleas  We are tired of your hypocrisy because you do not support SEPARATISTS equally worldwide. It is all about hegemony and politics of divide and conquer.
NiiiiiintendoGuy51 the reason why he wants to invade Ukraine is so he can take control of them so they can’t join NATO. If Ukraine joins NATO, the U.S. and the U.K. are permitted to station nuclear missiles their with the Ukrainian’s permission, which both countries said they would do given permission. That’s just the explanation but understand that I not at all think this warrants invasion.
 @TAGB1  oh ok I will
If Putin Swallow Ukraine he will swallow More of European countries and he will become emperor again 🧐Then Russia up 🔼  USA and Europe  down ⬇️ ,😑,
thank you🤍
But Ukraine’s president heart doesn’t melt.even a bit . He is not sorry for his people . But yours is broken xd
 @Ceyla Steff HidalgoJ  are you in Ukraine as well right now?
 @StofStuiver  so you don't care about innocent lives of civilians being lost?
 @trollege  Of course i do, but i dont limit my empathy to one side, idiot.
Really, it breaks? I really don't think the people of Ukraine need your lies
 @dev stuff  Easy m8. These are all just brainwashed idiots.They dont know a thing, see a video of explosions and immediately presume chiildren are dying and break down in tears, not knowing they themselves contributed to this.
 @StofStuiver  I can fix that for you, no one gives a damn because our idiots congressional leaders are all about country first and not some pointless land mark
Простым жителям Украины ничего не угрожает
Some flashbacks from Operation Iraqi Freedom... Russian style
Good job Russia 🇷🇺 👏 👍
Hopefully Russia will clear up those nazis as soon as possible and give freedom back to Ukranian people that i admire 🙏🙏🙏
What about the Russian  infiltrated gangs arresting Ukrainians for fates we cannot imagine?
“It’s clear that they don’t want to be liberated by Vladimir Putin”
This is truly sad 😢. This murderous thug really things the World is going to believe him that he did this in self defense?!?! Putin preplanned this all along! You invade into someone else's country and yet you said it was self defense
USA get in there and take out Russia.
This is not good but That’s what happens when you trust American and western allies. Look at Libya,Iraq,Syria,Afghanistan and … People of those countries also had trust in America and its western allies and now they have nothing.
Look, no matter how you are viewed by this, whether you think it wastes your tax money, whether you think it's worthless you pray or think they should fight on their own. Lives are still gonna lost, and we are talking potential mass genocide and things are really gonna get messed up if things goes bad. Imagine this was your problem instead of theirs, the dread, the hopenessless you would fell, my country although had a kinda good history with russia during the USSR, I still think this is pretty messed up and even we don't agree with this. The ones with the powers give orders and it's the innocents who has nothing to do with it dies. Some might argue that similar things happened to some other countries and why don't we care about them and why should we care for ukraine now. Well....here's something for you to care for, would you do it now or ignore like the previous times it happened? Although it won't do anything helpful, I still pray for ukraine surviving this, Russia is a really tough one to be against.
All Ukraine citizens need to return home and fight youre country needs you..
Ukraine donated more money to the Clinton foundation than any other since 99 to 2014. Biden, Pelosi, kerry and Romney all have children working for Ukrainian gas companies. Coincidence? I think not.
Ukrain army needs to crossed border and bring this war to russia's land or else Ukrainian civilians will be in jeopardy.
I understand it's not an easy job BUT someone has to tell Putin he looks quite evil and unpleasant... Maybe CGI or a double for such appearances...
USA DID SAME THING 20 YEARS AGO TO IRAQ  .1.5 MILLION DEATHS.  THIS IS WRONG WHY IS U.S ALL OVER EUROPE ASIA AUSTRALIA WHAT DO THEY WANT .IThink they want us all fighting to sell all weapons to us head cases with nuclear bombs all over the world, it doesn't look good for humans co19 were did that come from now this , I think the aliens have to show up and tell us what to do on earth,I HOPE THIS IS OVER SOONER RATHER THAN LATER  ,BIDEN  very old man Johnston very stupid man Putin's very angry man 😞😞😞😞
Is it not a war rule to bomb civilians!?
THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE AFRAID TO SPEAK BECAUSE THERE'S CONCUNCES   IF THEY DO SO,
Putin acts like a massive murderer right now I can't find logic,  sorry
…Just remember Yugoslavia, Syria, Libya,Irak etc.. Nobody talking about Violations of International Law??… How convenient eh?? .. I hope Victoria Nuland bring them some Cookies 🍪…!!!
🛑UK AND AMERICA TO BLAME FOR ALL WARS *
The pits of hell open for you
By bombing the Ukrainian people? Oh ye nice job. Russia has just as many nazis, they just pretend not to be.
Come back when you can post an intelligent comment, fool!
Everybody saying 
It was necessary to think with your head when to make a coup d'état in Ukraine and put American people in power and then threaten NATO bases near the borders of Russia, remember the events in Cuba
This is the defining moment of the 21st century. Just like last time, just like always, this is what right-wing populism/authoritarianism, fueled by xenophobia and racism always leads to: wars of aggression and the suffering and death of innocents. How we react to Putin is the clearest litmus test possible for the terrible question facing us. And already fascists all over the world are lavishing praise and admiration on the gangster-oligarch-dictator who's trying to set the world on fire again.
Putin will age very quickly in the nearing years.
Propaganda....
Hope everyone is safe...may God bless each and every one in Ukraine... please keep all the children safe
Nuke Moscow NOW
Joe Biden encouraged Vladimir Putin to attack Ukraine to take the focus off of his horrendous residency in the White House.
criminal in kremlin, war crime
Democracies need to provide military support to Ukraine. Sanctions will not stop bullets in the short run.
That's really so hard to watch...i can't imagine how kids are feeling right now 😢💔
Hide in the Shadows;Shame Worlds in My Heart.🤨
Allah Ukrayna'ya yardım etsin. Dil, din , ırk ne olursa olsun savaş korkunç. Türkiyeden selamlar kalbimiz sizinle. Bu savaş hemen son bulur inşallah.  🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦♥️♥️
Putin bluntly threatened every other country by saying anyone who thinks of intervining will face consequences like never before. How can these other countries just stand and watch this man do that. Are we all bowing down to Putin? I really hope USA and UK can do something to help Ukraine
So this means war
NATO is a joke and they're not going to help anyone, but themselves.
Biden warned Ukraine for at least the last 2 weeks, nobody listened! :(
MY HEART GOES OUT TO THE CIVILIANS IN YEMEN WHO DONT HAVE ALL THIS MEDIA TO TALK ABOUT THE AGGRESSION OF EUROPEAN AND AMERICAN PARTNERS (SAUDI ARABIA, UAE).
Horrible stuff from Russia. Attacking and disturbing innocent people's lives is a big let down for humanity. We stand with Ukrainian brothers and sisters no matter what, may God protect them.

Thanks, BBC. Very clear and complete video. It was an important message at 8:11: this is not a conflict that russian public want. This is the Kremlin's war.
My prayers to the lost innocents! WAR SUCK!
Sadly, our sympathies can't change minds. I tear up for the children who have to witness and live through this. One thing I know for sure is, NATO can't help. They lost their voice when they kept silent of America's invasions throughout the decade. By now I think NATO as an organ are extremely calculating, like what if Russia evokes a Nuclear war post their involvement. I think they are all praying Putin conquers Ukrain before the World calls them out for their Hypocrisy. My prayers are with the affected civilians of this inhumane choice Presidents make.
Everything will be alright ❤❤
It sad to see folks of Ukraine to go through this. My thoughts and prayers to the citizens of Ukraine.
This fight is between Russia with Ukraine..Do not cross the border as Israel VS Palestin from 1950 till NOW !! American & UN just watch only..
Prayers for the people of Russia as well.
I hear words but don’t really see the pictures of what they are saying.
Has, Russia gained air supremacy over Ukraine, yet?
5:20 this guy doesn't know that Ukrainans welcomed Nazis with flowers back then in WW2 and it's obvious who they rooting for so callled 
Ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars ser that te be not troubled for al these things must come to pass but the end is not yet.For nations shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom and there shall be famines, and pestilences and earthquakes in diverse places. All these are the beginning of sorrows.Because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold. But he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved.Repent of your sins God will protect his people.
How is there people left in East if putin said it has been genocides for years.
I believe it is our duty to accept hundreds of thousands of female Ukrainian refugees.
Civilians are being killed...yet are still being told to stay home.....
No one should want war
How is there no war

Z world. :D TV War....distractions from 5th session of the Grand Jury Proceedings.
This is only mind set put Ukraine in this situation.. Human live both sides even Afghanistan have humans aswell but your prayers is only for Ukraine 😂 haha.. Ask your self where is Nato allies
 @Aakash Verma  and how did ukraine mess with russia
If Putin Swallow Ukraine he will swallow More of European countries and he will become emperor again 🧐Then Russia up 🔼  USA and Europe  down ⬇️ ,😑,
 @Aakash Verma  facts
As the politicians start the wars, they hide in Their bunkers protecting themselves why the innocent citizens deal with the consequences... I just wish the people would wake up & see the bigger picture.. We are better off without Politics.
Go Russia 🇷🇺. Screw NATO.
 @Aakash Verma  what part of Russia did Ukraine attacked ?
 @George Cher  exactly what we need
 @Tom Clancy  idk, by trying to join Nato I guess? Imagine Canada and Mexico joining Chinese alliance. How would you feel about that?
 @Tom Clancy  by flirting with NATO (USA) If the US banned ukraine from joining NATO putin would be happy and not invade
https://youtu.be/lo6ZCiUZ3Ew
Ukraine isnt the only one thats going to go through it things are about to get ugly and we could see blood on american soil
 @The Sniper  The US will be involved shortly & the whole world will feel us coming.
 @Evry none  I see your point but still ukraine is an independent country. You can't just directly attack a whole country just because it's slowly joining the west. It's like you getting pissed off because your ex has moved on XD
 @Tom Clancy  it's more than your ex just moving on. Ukraine is Russia's neighbour. If NATO gets closer ties with Ukraine, that is threatening to Russia. Having an enemy right on your border is not something one would like. Russia's invasion is just.
 @Evry none  understandable
 @Evry none  So if Ukraine becomes part of Russia then they do indeed have NATO at their borders and then what? Miss Putin need to eat a snickers and retire.
This is how Palestinians feel every day and have been for decades, America is funding and supporting Isreal while they do the same thing to Palestinians.
Have you ever been sad to seeeople of Donbass?
Nobel Peace Committee are you seeing this?? This is what happens when you give Peace prize to a politician. Now Mr. Putin wants to show to the world who is the actual keeper of peace or on whose shoulders the peace lies safely in Europe. May be you should consider giving Mr. Putin a peace prize. Or a joint peace prize to Mr. Biden and Mr. Putin but that will surely bring Mr. Trump into picture and you should answer him as to why he should not be given the peace prize. So committee, in view of so many families being affected you should revise your policies...I wonder if a prize return from his rival politician will satisfy Mr. Putin's ego...
If you have anyone is Ukraine get into contact with me and we can evacuate them to poland
What's the bet the 
Very sad to see this.
Where is NATO ukraine leader should  had drawn the nato they knew very well what is coming better to peaceful treaty still not to be late enough for consequences...
This appears to be America vs Russia. They are using Ukraine as a battlefield.
Oh no.
Your reporters should not be a target please, just use a phone and look like you checking updates that can maybe help to do this job more safely. Russia really antagonising them self. Please be smart and stay safe✌️🇺🇦.Turn of lights, stay away from key points, like gas-stations, supply for army/stock-compounds and maybe screw the street signs of their post, so they have maybe a hard time to find the government buildings.
Imagine what it was like for the Afghanistan people when the United States just pulled out and left them to their own devices against the Taliban. We in the United States cannot even protect her own southern border, and yet they want us to protect the Ukrainian border.
PEACE NOW PLEASE, PEACE NOW!!!! Putin you're a awful person May Karma strikes you
I'll keep saying it. The people don't want war. The only ones who want war are those who look to profit from it in some way. Our governments are making it clear that what the people want doesn't matter. The only way that stops is by the people standing up to it. The people of every country outnumbers those who govern them. Sovereignty and right's aren't just foreign issues. These days they are more often domestic. They all want control. They want no accountability. They don't believe in the people. They believe in themselves. They believe in their financial and social gains. Some of the smartest people with ill intentions are making decisions they shouldn't be making without the consent of the people. Period.
America and NATO provoked the war, now hiding in fear.....!!Pray for the innocent people caught up in this.
1000년만 죽이자 러시안
They are slaughtering civilians and targeting civilian facilities. Where the fuck are the cries of war crimes?
World war 3 started soon guys let's prepare for the opponents 💥🥳By the way who will be you're support 🎉🎊😇
If you think this is bad, this is only the beginning
Russia is a modern day nazi that needs to be stopped ✋️
i guess NATO better start strengthen Poland, cause Poland is the bulwark again Russia take over of all of Europe
Looks like NATO is jealous of Russia because it's not themselves to bombarded and making messy things like that
How do they know it's Russian projectiles? Maybe Iceland?
has nato military abandoned ukraine?were is the nato military?it's past sanctions.nato help defend those innocent people.you promised them that.
Putin is a super Howard😡😡🤬🤬
This is the fault of the democratsWho voted for Biden. The guy is aJoke but it's not very funny toAfghans and Ukrainians is it.America needs strong leadership.When they are weak the world becomes a dangerous place.Rogue nations cause trouble.Russia is now a rogue nation,No better than north Korea.
Putin  threatened all other countries with nuclear weapons. Said that will use them if they help Ukraine.
I guess the last 8 years of shelling Donbas wasn't a great idea was it....Its a different type of posturing from ZELENSKY now isn't it....
Snarling, perfect word.
Надо было Минские договорённости выполнить,а не тянуть 8 лет.Всякому терпению приходит конец.Скажите спасибо США.
I’m soo sorry for this !! Nonsense!!! This is Putin’s ego war! Against his own people ! Russia !! Don’t hit your mother !
Things could have been easily avoided by just not joining/denying NATO near Russia. And yet things got this far just some douchebag thought NATO will make his country greater. I hope peace for everyone and still hope people on the table can find common ground. All the best wishes for the general civilians
NATO,USA & Their Allies did A 1/2 Cooked Food Job  in Iraq,Afghanistan,Libya & Syria. Are they goung to Cook the same Half Cooked Food Job  in Russia??
UNSECURITY SHOULD ACT FAST ... PUTIN HAS NO INTENSION FOR A DIPLOMACY.... SLOW ACTION WILL ALWAYS RESULT ADVANTAGE TO PUTINS STRATEGY. HE IS A WELL TRAIN KGB AGENT .. THE US AND NATO SHOULD LEARN FROM THE PAST ... HIS CAMPAIGN FOR MIS INFORMATION IS MOVING FORWARD. HE IS USING PSY WAR TACTICS.   SANCTIONS WILL NOT WORK ... WHILE DIPLOMACY AND TALKS IS GOING ON ... HE IS TAKING THE TIME TO PURSUE HIS PLAN SMOOTHLY WHILE UN SECURITY IS NOT MAKING PROPER ACTION AGAINTS INVASION OF RUSSIA IN UKRAINE. TAKE ACTION NOW OR REGRET LATER. THE WORLD DOES NOT WANT WAR ... BUT PUTIN ... WANTS WAR NO MATTER WHAT .... EVEN WE TRIED TO PREVENT IT ... HE WILL PURSUE HIS PLAN... SO WHY NOT USE TOOTH FOR A TOOTH AND AN EYE FOR AN EYE...TAKE THE RISK ... SINCE THE RISK IS ALREADY AT HAND ... MAKE A TOUGH DECISION LIKE UKRAINAINS IN DEPENDING THEIR SOVEREIGNTY UNTIL DEATH... GOD BLESS US ALL ! EVIL WILL NOT WIN ....
Ukraine had  YEARS  to prepare,  arm every civilian,  install air defenses on cities & airports.  It is up to Ukraine to defend Ukraine.   USA just spent  20 years i n Afghanistan.  Don's call  U.S.      FIX IT YOURSELF.
Fight! Help will only come if you fight for your country. It's so sad and unbelievable that this is happening, the world shouldn't let this happen.
Putin is a war criminal. Another Hitler in the making. Russia should be cut off from the rest of the world. Just like North Korea.
Please negotiate.
Does this mean Hunter will stop getting payments from Russia and dont forget ten percent to the Big Guy
🇺🇸 and European 🇪🇺 including 🇬🇧  France 🇫🇷 has politically assassination 🇺🇦  to Russia 🇷🇺.  When 🇷🇺 began to attacks Ukraine.  🇺🇸 said:  we prayed our sisters and brothers in Ukraine 🇺🇦. Results of western politics.It's heartbreaking Ukrainian people my allaha protect from Russia attacks.
May God protect every civilian and protect Ukraine 🤲🙏💙🇺🇦

Why couldn't no one stop him before he started 😡 Ukraine was sitting peacefully in their home until this monster came along, enough talking. I can NEVER imagine this here
Nations that forget their history are doomed to repeat it.Now is time for Ucranians to become migrants, like Syrians, Afghans and Venezuelans; all because of the ambition of the leaders and the inaction of other.
Prayers 🙏🏻
Too late to pray for peace... that ship sailed out of the port.  Kinda how we got here in the first place.  Rather than action we just sit back and let it happen.   Only resolution will be military so basically Russia has won since the NATO and West will do nothing.
US invaded Iraq Afghanistan for self defense when they are 1000s miles away, don’t what to say!!
THIS IS HOW PALESTINE 🇵🇸 PEOPLE FEEL LIKE EVERYDAY.
So this isn't terrorism???
God bless Russia
I lived in Israel last year, when their was also rockets, it isn't much of a comparison but still I feel for Ukraine.
To be honest I'm not surprised that this happened. The Russians will do anything to get more land, even taking out the civilians. We need to stop this before it escalates into a nuclear war.
War is good
Where is NATO hidden after all this drama in the front line....

Putin IS THE NAZI....🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
I don't think this will happen but the conflict will really escalate if Poland and or Moldova get involved
What about the leaders just fight each other MMA style
77 years after WWII .... and the war in Europa again. Why???

What the fuck.
CGI PUTIN ON TV.!COME DEEPSTATE CAN'T YOU DO BETTER YOU PLAY THE SAME SHIT ALL THE TIME.!NOBODY BUYING IT ANYMORE.!YOU THICK FUCKS....
Read the Third Fatima's Secret... there is everything about what is going on now between Russia and Ukraine... This is the End of times!
Putin should be charged with war crimes against humanity.
Decieving laying evil human!
Can’t believe this happened in 2022.
Great explanation 👌

Lets drop all Russia bullshit. This is a pure war of aggression.
1000년은 죽이자 러시안
The Bullies ,are been Bullied .
This is unthinkable and horrible: One mad man threatening the whole world... Shame on us.
普京是个杀人犯，刽子手
It's better for Ukraine to surrender to Russia now! Putin won't stop until he gets Ukraine so this is the only way to end the bombing I'm afraid
oh no ww3 incoming
Azov fleeing to Canada.
People who doubted 🤡
If Putin is really a good person, he would declare independence long ago, not now to use that declared independence as an excuse as a shield for Russian to be first destroyed in a war, if u understand, the independence is used to destroy them, while Russia laugh. Some people support Putin but now can see the true colours of Putin using innocent people in war times as his shield and distraction, this means his military power is weak and he is just putting a false show.
I seen on a different news ch that Russia is the biggest exporter in wheat and they haven't been selling any for 2 months so I'm pretty sure this was planned long ago. I'm going to be praying for the people of Ukraine. This is absolutely devastating and depressing for us all. It could affect all countries in different ways. IF CHINA TEAMS UP WITH RUSSIA THEN PHARMACEUTICAL AND OTHER THINGS COULD BE SCARSE BECAUSE CHINA IS A BIG. IMPOTER TO USA NOT SURE ABOUT OTHER COUNTRIES to 6:45 to the man starting if Putan isn't stopping now. Then this could be the beginning of world War 3
Where are the alies...where is the union...no NATO???
This remind me US invasion in Iraq which was more destructive & deadlier.
Our EnpireTold You English in 1945 that You have Done a very Wrong Mistake.Now;Here is Final Prove to Whom has Always been the Real Enemy.😡
Ukraine surrender you cannot fight Russia it’s a waste of time
First Afghanistan now Ukraine.....Good job Biden. God please keep the Ukrainians safe.
He has always been evil now there is know question
Ukrainian fight for what Ukrainian oligarchs and criminal gorvement
When the U.S. drove five waves of NATO expansion eastward all the way to Russia’s doorstep…, did it ever think about the consequences of pushing a big country to the wall? rYou kept poking the bear and now he bites you all act surprised. rU.S./UK keeps playing silly games with China and Russia. They shouldn't be angry or surprised if they win silly prizes. rGoogle '' US bases map'' and tell us again how Russia is a scary bear?
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭💔💔💔💔💔💔
Ohhh God protect the civilian  they dont deserve this kind of attack by russian government...
Russia has many enemies in Europe, Russian soldiers will perish soon,when NATO and the countries unite against Communist aggression.... semper Fi...
Russia is nazi state
He wants to attack balkan too
Putin : existsUkraine: 😭😭
This is awful 😞
Blame western countries for using Ukraine to further their own agenda since they can't stop China and Russia from progressing economically.
Ukraine please stop your country from joining nato. If you love your country please sign treaty with russia that guarantee that they will not invade your country.
Putin said its a  special war operation not a military operation, i think it makes a difference ? 6:25
What does war solve seriously?
Blame NATO for this
Prayers to Ukraine, but NATO needs to stay CLEAR of this war.
What war is ever a war that the public wants? All wars are initiated by the leaders not the public and sometimes the leaders use effective propaganda to turn the public on their side if effective enough.
The president of Ukraine bet on NATO and usa which was a big mistake and telling his country men not to panic he is a real idiot , he should have told them panic and panic as soon as possible and run away.
They then said 
I hope we can do more than slap Putin with sanctions. I hope our friends in Ukraine make it, and I pray peace will reign over all.Belarus should be sanctioned as well...they both said they are not attacking, they both said it's war GAMES...not preparation. Liar says it's bad for the US to do things and then Russia does EXACTLY what they accused the US of. Except we haven't invaded Mexico to prop up their government whose afraid of drug cartels. But I'm sure Russia would have a problem if we did....but sanctions won't do anything.
Where is the united nation.
No-one should romanticise war. It's hell on earth. And it's the innocents who suffer the most.
Albert Einstein said an ambiguous yet prophetic phrase: 
What Putin has done is give the Ukrainians good reason to murder every Russian speaking citizen in their borders, the lies out of Russia about self defense are just that lies.
거짓말은 하지 말하지 짜르
N.A.T.O STAY OUT OF THE REGION...THIS SKIRMISH WILL END IN PEACE TALKS...N.A.T.O IF YOU ADVANCE THERE WILL BE  NUCLEAR STRIKES...THESE TWO COUNTRY'S WERE ONCE ONE...JUST AS THE DONBASS AND NEIGHBOR TO THE NORTH..UKRAINE WAS ONCE JUST LIKE THEM....LETS USE REASON HEREAND END THIS AS FAST AS IT BEGAN....
Meanwhile China navy moving on Taiwan. This is a coordinated attack on a west weakened by the CCP covid virus
Zelensky, a former comedian who sees his mandate become a tragedy. Fickle is fate.
Go Russia😎👍🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺smash those snakes globalists who put there clown 🤡Zelinsky to provoke and make war..
Putin is a price of lying garbage. Defend themselves my arse. He's the Instigator and he need taken out. God Bless these people. They just want price and to live their lives.
Russia and China are on the War Path, the way of Domination by Force. They will never stop, the sooner the rest of us recognize this the better. Just like a deadly virus invading the body, it must be totally defeated and Eliminated. Nothing else matters. We must eliminate the leadership, the governmental controllers, and not have years of ground / air conventional war, killing millions before they take the world, make no mistake , they will never stop, they are EVIL and they want the world by force, Evil is in our own lands as well Trump praises Putin and his minions are trying to take the government. WE must lock him up and all who are guilty of crimes as well. We must stop this now or we will have endless war, it is starting just like Hitler taking Poland etc. This is not an overreaction, Russia and China are after the world and will not stop , but proceed in a strategic effort to avoid any direct action on themselves , but keep it ' out there
Why don't they fight not leave?
This is so STUPID PERIOD
Ukraine needs urgently needs SAM systems and SHORAD systems.Countries that have them, please give as many as you can to Ukraine ASAP.
Worlds fucked gonna be a nuclear war 100%
I’m from Mexico and I’m flying to help Ukrainian 🇲🇽🇺🇦🙏🏻💙
It is even possible to stop the evil putin?
I am a bit  concerned because the media has lost a lot of credibility but at the same time that is all we have. I am confused taking everything with a grain of salt. You world leaders never listen to putin. He wanted peace
At the end, It will be like Afghanistan when nato leaves afgh. and handed over to terrorist Taliban. Nobody's will help Ukraine.
We've entered a whole new world... Folks, remember this when the fire consumes all that is left...
Ww3 wil happen now if the navo is gonna respond with troops
not one word about NATO enccroachment upon Russia.    Take a look at NATO membership since 1999 and look at the real communications that have been very much ongoing for the last eight years as Putin has asked for and demanded security garuntees from the United Nations and NATO.     Biden is playing 
This is so upsetting. I was hoping the Russians would overthrow putt putt.
Words wont stop him sanctions wont work once he takes over every thing you will never get him out again NATO is an old man waving his walking stick at Putin , NATO wont bleed for you they don't protect those weaker than themselves only members of there click.
🇷🇺
DEnazify Ukraine, does that mean now Putin and Russians will go back home?
Muslims should understand one thing Ukraine supports Israel not Palastine, Ukraine supports many crusades against muslims so please stop to support Ukraine
ЛЮДИ РОССИИ.Выходите на митинги. Не молчите. За вас все решили, на ваши налоги устраивают войну.
The beginning of world 🌎 war...the Russian people don't want this the world don't want it Russia I am disappointed
Imagine all the people... living life in peace... you may say I'm a dreamer... but I'm not the only one.  Imagine if Putin was actually killing innocents for Peace.
1st Taliban next =Ukraine This is lyf?????
Even in 2022, we still have countries invading other countries. When will we learn that we are one race and countries and borders don't really exist, they're just constructs created by us. Start considering fellow humans and stop having this primal belief of our own interests above everyone else's.
........something does not look right here. I smell big time BS.  NEVER trust msm media.
My grandma is in Ukrainian and I am crying and my mom send all of to the Ukrainian and may god give them luck and to my grandma
What the? I dont want a war.... and i dont want to hear wrong translation of Putin's speach
In front of Russia , no one strech their tail, like they do with Pakistan
this is horrific.. my thoughts and prayers go out to all involved!
To all ukranian watching this, i fully support you hope your family live remain safe. God is watching everything. I love you guys🇮🇳🇺🇦
Putin is destroying life, i am sad for the Ukrainian , this is their country ,
Too many old minded leaders running countries, people just want to live and enjoy their lives, this conflict isn’t needed at all and the fact Russias owns citizens don’t support their leaders decision just says it all. Too many innocent people are going to die.
Putin's only fear is the Russian people, only they can depose him.  He is showing them do not look to the west and do not think about revolution like Ukraine did in 2014.  He will not stop until he marches through Independence Square / Maidan in Kiev and reverses the 2014 revolution.
In the name of humanity stop this war and try to find a solution by discussing. Why do the people suffer this war? What have they done wrong to be victims, they are innocent. Please stop this war and try to discuss.
I hope the Ukraine army give the Russian army hell. Send some missile to Moscow and bomb the kremlin, see how they like it.
If the West do nothing this time they will regret it. Putin is a megalomaniac and he probably wants to eventually rule over a hugely expanded Russian Empire
Our Apologies Ukraine in behalf of a member of the US  Armed Forces. Our Military have been weakened by poor leadership. We are no longer what we use to be during WWII and The Cold War. As you can see the result of 20yrs of Conflict in Afghanistan. We have been fighting with one hand tied behind our back by Politicians. Sorry we can only watch from a far while your country is being invaded and destroyed.
Self defence from what
Dont call nato bcuz is useless they wll not help ukraine...
China looking at Taiwan and saying : you see that? guess who's next?

I feel bad for the mothers and fathers on both sides because a lot of them are going to lose their children who went to fight for their countries
Who cares??? Ukrain looks like a shithole
time to test US new nuclear bombs to russia
I disagree with any kind of war happened in any single country, but if a country is provoked to waging war with the plotted opponent, it is the right of the opponent to react to bully seriously, it means that the opponent had been  lost patient then physical attack is inevitable.
Spoken like a true despot!
THE FALSE FLAGS HAVE BEGUN THEN BLAME PUTIN.!THE WORLDS AWAKE TOO THE BULLSHIT...
I think its time for the New Avengers Initiative <3
In Ukraine, I support
러시아는 1000년 동안  죽여 버릴ㄹ거여. 보이면 죽이자 러시안
They destroyed an airport does that mean Russia doesn't want people to leave?
Unfortunately the peasants on both sides pay the price.  Ukrainian was never independent…. It has been at the ravaged by the west who used it for their resources and location and their politicians all too happy to sell out.  Brandon included, made millions over there, now using them again to distract us from the mess he created in US.  God help us!
Why the news reader or journalist tell the truth?  This western journalist are the one provocking war. We have seen how western journalist telling us from IRAQ WAR. Would i trust you? Not even for a minutes.
Heartbreaking to see all these. Hope everyone stays safe and prayers to everyone.
WHAT THE FU%% ARE THEY TRYNA DO
No leader in the world has balls to stop Putin? ? USA - a declined superpower.
Russians should overthrow Putin before things gets worse
I'm not going to war. I feel the war isnt our war. American 1st. u people worried about everyone else is the problem. it sucks it's happening. but what has Ukraine done for the u.s.? all I know of Ukraine is a lot of the democratic party has forced Ukraine to do things they didnt want too. and pad their pocket off Ukraine 🤷🏻‍♂️ change my mind
https://youtube.com/shorts/eCgMVNeko9g?feature=share
Pssh u haven't seen yet what comes in future 😁 many people die

Ukraine has given up their Nuclear Arsenal for the US, in exchange for Protection.Hope that answers your Question.
 @Another German Mapper  that doesnt. I'm talking financially for america. I wouldnt of giving up the nukes. they wouldnt be in the situation today if they had nukes. nukes are like holding the gun in a knife fight. why u think no one messes with North Korea? dude has nukes. again, it sucks it's happening. but they put their trust in someone else outside own their own. the people of the u.s. didnt ask for them to give up their nukes. they fell trap to the royal family. bush is a distant family of the queen.
He's a puppet that lies pretending someone else is the threat. When we all know who the real threat is. Ukraine has protected their government from the enemy. Can't let this plandemic go to waste.
It's time for Lenin's communism to die.......
#StopTheKill
Ukraine will loose they country or not, but Russia will suffer  from now in all ways posible, and i'm afraidn this is not the end of this story
Putin acting like a gangster… so sorry to the people of ukraine 🇺🇦
It's crazy. I honestly didn't think he was gonna go through with it. I thought he was just trying to intimidate everyone.
My thoughts and prayers to all Ukrainians. Love from Malaysia.
Please think PEACE.
SUPPORT ROSSIA FROM BULGARIA 🇧🇬
Looks like Belgade couple years ago! Enjoy it!

Shut up. Ur part of russia.
Damn bro i was about to travel for the girlsss ffss
Omg stop with the bullshit Ukraine knew this was going to happen, and Putin issued he was 2 days ago.
Broooo it is 2022 what is this old fuck doing, Putin is committing war crimes and ruining the Russian economy.
It's a monstrous acts by Russia, needs condemnation, the modern days imperialist colonialism expansionism,  Ukrainians should come out to protest in the streets
Anglo-zionist weapon stationed only 500 miles away from Moskau? Putin: It is all in self-defence. He is the only one who isn't lying.
The de-NAZIfication of Ukraine. Hmm.

Only the governments want more never peace the citizens they just want to live their lives raise their children they don't want war! I think the world would be a better place without governments! I think it'd be a great idea if these countries that have disagreements if their leaders got into a fighter's ring and duked it out themselves and then the winner they could negotiate for what they want and be on top of things!
Where is nato's propaganda????
8 лет украина долбила Донбасс убивала мирных жителей, детей и всем было плевать...Но стоило только России начать наводить порядок и все взвыли....
Activision are licking their lips right now.
War fuelled by USA and NATO... Russia reacted..
Something tells me that the Ukraine military would fold just like the Afghanistan military.
Lets hope Putin gets what he deserves one day.
🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺♥️
So tragic💔💔💔😭😭😭🇺🇦❤🇵🇭
If... if only USA has a president not Biden but....Trump. Putin may think twice to attack Ukraine.
Let us pray for the Ukraine and for Russia, too, and also for the US and the whole liberal world, the evil ones who provoked this war! This is the truth! Each and every life which has been thrown away for the money hungry globalists is to cry for, every single person who loses their lives and existence just because of the Mammon - those demons are sent by Satan! Let us pray that the Lord makes an end to it, Amen!
All hail Russia
Hey world, stop this hitler!!!
my heart goes to Ukraine and its people! I'm from Croatia and was part of the exactly same scenario from Serbs in 90's. this is on much bigger scale and more dangerous. Proud of Ukrainian people standing up and fighting, if i was younger i would join them! Putin (not Russians) have to be stopped. good luck to all!!
Should I still get the booster?
No he just wants to get rid of your puppet government …
putin is not against the people of ukraine but its corrupt leaders & elites
Iraq and Afghanistan is the only countries who knows what Ukrainian current situation. pray for Ukrainian people
Why do they shoot civilians... that apartment building doesn't look very militaristic to me
The Russians are coming! Just stay home! Human shields is Ukraines leaderships plan! Civilians die in war its best to get away from one! Staying home and hoping it ends is super risky! Not good advise! So far it looks like Putin is just taking out weapons. lets hope it ends when they are all gone. Putin eradicating nazis sounds like some Demacrate party rubbish to me!!!
I'm not from there,but I can't stop crying.I'm super feel devastated to Ukrainians and civilians  who were just  living there for a normal life
I laughed when the narrator said 
Piss off BBC.
That protesting woman has more balls than all of them.
Dumb brain 🧠 washed people thinking they can defeat the Russians. You have no air defenses and a real air force. It’s over for any ground forces you have if you can’t defend yourself from the air. Your sitting ducks unfortunately
putin give the freedom to ukraine
Love from India 🇮🇳 to Ukraine 🇺🇦. Gay Hind 🇮🇳💪

This is absolutely horrendous. I hope that Puton and his supporters are defeated and that the Ukraine will be saved.
War is never a solution. Sooner or later they will sit together for talks. Why not start talks right now. It will save many innocent lives.
Shut your mouth
The western did that to hpn
 @Addis ababa City  *Humankind caused that to happen. Stop playing the pointing finger game its childish
 @Addis ababa City  Stop defending the invaders, Ukraine is an independent state, Russia has NO AUTHORITY over Ukriane.
 @Trashboªt  open your eyes
There is no such thing as culture humans develop there living experience as a function of resources available which differ from place to place and for exchange of these resources they need a common medium and we see it as language.
How exactly is Ukraine a threat to anyone? Putin's statement makes no sense whatsoever. He's just a war hungry clown who wants to see the world burn is all.. If Russians had a set of balls they would have overthrown him a long time ago.
Does anyone really believe anything coming out of Putin's mouth? Everything he says is the opposite.
Working out just as how the western leaders plan it.
Fight back!
🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
Putin is like a spoilt child...wants everything and everyone in his clutches and if they don't want to bow down the vile specimen just kills innocent people..We have to stand together ...May you all stay safe 🙏 ❤ Wish I could keep you safe x
All the rumours were true. Sadly, people kept joking on the whole situation. Hope this gets over soon but it is worse that nobody will militarily help Ukraine and Russia will be in full control of the country :(
Mad man and a Bully
Evil is showing his true face, support ukraine,
Caucasian madness

They are all in on it!!!!!! Its us the people vs world govnt. All the govnts are controlled by people in the same secret society. soooooo
They knew it was coming. We knew it was coming. Putin gets what Putin wants. Hes an old dog uninterested in new tricks.  Social media won't stop this war. He doesn't give a f#$k what anyone thinks. NATO is a waste of your time. Take a look America! You aren't far from it.
Hello call of duty game developer, you have something new
This is just like the invasion of poland, from a WW3 documentary I watched in Netflix. So surreal and sad.
This is really horrible😭
Not wise to die if you know enemy is more powerful. Better to talk and avoid war.
Put in it have no respect for you civilians  are getting attacked. Ja we will see
From Africa one day Putin actions will hunt him. One day someone gonna humbled him
Russia believes in what they are doing. After being lied to. By the wester governments. I support Russia is the attack.
My heart goes to the Ukrainian civilians
Ok now that's crossing the line!

Russia has the right to protect the manoritys and defend Russia from the expansion of NATO,  nato is a dangerous organization able to destroy any small contry ...

Where is our weak and liar in cheat Biden now? Where is NATO? Where is Hunter who took money from the Ukraine?  This would have never happened under Trump.  We have a NWO puppet running the White House.  Are you woke or awake?  Matthew 24 generation.  So much deception and distraction.
World war 3
Even though people dying is not good, Putin is doing the right thing by taking it by force, Biden is trying to take this country and use it for a first move attack on Russia since it’s close, Putin is protecting his country whether his people or Ukrainians like it or not, my respect for this man 💯
Ukarian is fool to trust the USA that has rich history of betrayal. USA, UK did promiss with Ukarian to defend its terroteries on unarming Nukes during 90s.
Stand for Ukraine
Most government systems have been infiltrated by the enemy. Ukraine though, had managed up until now to keep the enemies out. NWO agenda.. Lake of Fire is heating up
What I observed from war...Some are making war, some are enjoying being on the side of offender,some are screaming on the side of defense,  some are igniting the war, some are keeping silent , some people don't know what it mean by war, ..., you know how we are an idiot?

God bless alaxanda and his wife and child and the rest of Ukraine!!! Stay strong. Stay safe. FUCK RUSSIA!!!!!
Where was the West when Russia invaded? Will be the question countries who think they can rely on the west for aid will ask.
Protest arrest in Moscow looks like arrest of Canadian Protester's !
Our thoughts and prayers are all very good but don’t forget the UK was prominent amongst those countries who persuaded Ukraine to give up their nuclear deterrent and promised protection against future Russian aggression. I wonder if this would be happening if Ukraine still had nuclear capability?
Once this is over they need to make Putin accountable for every single life lost. Blood is on his hands.
This is just unbelievable!!! How the eff could this happen? Finish this guy off.

No deseo la guerra, pero ha la vez es genial ver como es una guerra verdadera.
Handsome young boys oh 😠😥
I live in slovakia, which is country bordering ukraine. This situation hit lot of my friends very hard, so I just wanna add that if you want to help ukrainian people, there are many fonds... The acts of Russia are unaccaptable and they stand against everything in which I believe. Ukrainians are basically like our brothers.
I hope this will end peacefully and soon 😔. I stand with Ukraine 🇺🇦
Viva ukrine
Looks like biden got a nice distraction from his incompetence. And some more American millionaires get richer
With a strong leader other nations fear the consequences of their actions, but with Biden, the doors are open to do whatever they want.
if all those people had guns and fought it wud be serious.
Putin think he is now the master of the world but will surely finished and die like a poorest  man with innocent people blood on his hand  .
The Ukraine leader is a puppet of the west, Putin has every right to secure his country an borders, its just shady to see normal Ukrainians lost, the west started all this an WILL NOT back u up Ukrainians, open your eyes an stick a dildo up your leaders ass for causing trouble an sleeping with Nato, when u became free u were told never to sleep with Nato so what do u want Putin to do, hes Tony Montana's dad no1 can mess with him
From Syria to Ukraine what does he want innocent civilians? That's insane

 @Артем Мельников  Stop lying, they attackt several buildings and airports
 @William Renwei   is this the new Russian shill script? Just a couple of weeks ago you guys were saying it was just a military exercise.
 @Артем Мельников  so you think putin is doing the right thing?
 @William Renwei  The Soviets can also choose to surrender in 1941 and WW2 will end 4 years earlier. They chose not and continue fighting. Russia caused millions of deaths in Ukraine. You never say anything about Russian invasion ever right? Unlike USA, those countries neighbouring Russia suffered territorial loss and colonization in the 20th century.Edit: I support none of the aggression acts, just to poont out how nonsense such response was.
​ @William Renwei  Stop with the whataboutism. Russia is a dictatorship attacking a country where the people have rights. The USA's wars have in many cases been condemned and criticised by its own people and international community. Stop believing Putins propaganda machine making up lies or distracting as to why this is happening.
Thats ok then, I'm sure the Russians will just pack up and go home now. 👍
 @Robin Streets  I don't think so, russians are strong and they will definetly    try to destroy ukrain :( and if other countries will get involved in to this situation this can turn out to be the greatest war of all of the humanity... :(

So glad it’s Europe and not Middle East. Thank you Putin as I was getting fed up of war in Middle East. Also same thing Israel did to Palestine invade their land. Good to taste how it feels like
forcing people to hide underground, just like the nazi’s did to the british
You jokers in the comment section.Instead of thoughts and prayers, how about condemning this despot, tyrant dictator?
What happened to all those images of Ukrainians taking up arms and getting ready to fight the Russians? Now all we see is everyone fleeing in their cars.
Funny how bbc and Brits now have moral say. After raping aftica for centuries you think putin is bad. Have you been good yourself ? When blair said he will support bush whatever did you forget Iraqi are humans. Since you claim you are strong country, go get mother Russia.

This is just military practise, dont worry.
ITS A LYE BBC LIES
Stop evil Russian neo imperialist invasion in Ukraine
Because media lies with government along side. My putin isn't listening to lies anymore. As u can see
Blame liberal media. Incorrect translation of russian president speech
Gossips say that Biden was found in the Oval Office in the fetal position crying uncontrollably...Las malas lenguas dicen que encontraron a Biden en la oficina oval en posición fetal llorando desconsoladamente...
This is horrible. Best wishes to all Ukrainians.
Don’t worry Emma and her two moms will help
Where is their army ?  Russians are cruising trough the land unchallenged
DeNazify??? Seriously??? Who are we kidding here Putin? Sanctions will not stop Putin. Obviously he's prepared for all the sanctions that will be imposed. Freeze Russian assets... Russian hackers have been practicing on cyber attacks.
Please, Vladimir Putin, spare the lives of the innocents, please. Lord, have mercy on us. 🙏
What a horrible time to grow up, if I was still a kid I wouldn't be worrying about this kind of things. Now that Im a young adult Im aware of what's happening in the world and it breaks my heart. Why must humans still be this stupid. In war there's no such thing as victory. Both side lost something
THERE ISN'T GOING TO BE A UKRAINE ANYMORE
So sad for Ukrainian, my heart is broken 😞 #sosUkrania
Don't worry...the west will somehow find an excuse to put the blame in middle east
Duck em, bloody nazis
when they stop being able to do these types of reports then you know shit got real bad…
This was expected, my condolence for the civilian population of Ukraine.
My heart goes to all people who still believe they all not colluding together. This is all plan for reducing world population. WW3 is knocking on the door, and we stupid people will open that door just because governments says so.
Well Putin just use west medicine.... Nothing more, nothing less... I was in the same position like Ukraine people, just attacked by Nato. But outcome is the same. Big boys play war, people suffer...
No one believed us. They all said we were over exaggerating the situation and that Russia wouldn’t attack. Now they are all in a panic and trying to leave at once. They should of used all that time to prepare and leave when we told them to! I still stand with you Ukraine 🇺🇸 🇺🇦
Ukrainian people should stand up and fight for your country,, don’t just sit and die or run,, fight back… if Russia is not stop from now then no stopping again… and China will follow soon with Taiwan.
yeah trust putin, he is an angel, those bombs are just flowers. some idiots still believe that russia is not the enemy
Pure evil.
God bless Ukraine
Never trust the 👺. Praying for you all in Ukraine and us all 🙏🙏🙏🙏
They say they cannot feel safe yet they themselves develop weapons of mass destruction. The irony of people hungry for power and tyranny. Take out their weapons and power, now what are they? Its just a matter of time that we humans destroy ourselves. May God have mercy on us all. Only God knows the future of our species.
I am 34 years old.  For 20 years every time before going to sleep I pray for myself and for the whole world to be healthy.
I feel sorry for the terrified civilians. But their leaders brought it upon them.
Appears to be all about the petro dollar and world reserve status. Russia and China working together to draw the US into a war they can't win so a new super power can rise..
I hope this will be the start of the end for Putin
terrible. as if the world can't get any worse. Putin wants to restore soviet union.
Give them hell Ukraine!
😭😭
Doesn't seem to be working. Pray to Satan next time, might get better results.
10%to the big guy right.?
To Putin if you are not with him then you are against him and a Nazi, even if you are a Jew and in no way you can be a nazi, to him you are still a Nazi. That should say a lot about his personality, how he views the world and how he blatantly lies.
China India war in 6 months 😎
Please stop war. Be human Putin
Putin is a terrorist with an Army, he murders his competition for presidency. Kills innocent people he should be tried for war crimes! Claim self defense Ukraine has done nothing to Russia, Your Army dubbed Russian backed separatists is pure terrorisim.
Very tough time for Ukraine people. May god save all of them.
💔💔💔💔💔💔💔
This man is a madman Adolph Hitler was a child compared to this madman.I believe one Man should die for the wellbeing of our earth.President Putin should be that man.No compassion for the elderlyNo compassion for the mother's and father's.No compassion for the children.This man is a sick political leader.Special forces need to settle this man as they did with Saddam Hussein.
As a russia i fell like i dont have rights to comment here even if its a positive comment im very sorry for what has come, because of my country
Everyone is so quick to form snap judgements! Please don't believe all the propaganda.Stay awake. Eyes open.Ukraine broke the Minsk agreement and have bullied their own people. Ukraine is NOT a member of NATO, and since 1991 they have not even bothered to register its borders, which would have secured their international standing. Part of the reason for that is they had to get agreement from each of their neighbours for such a border, and they never settled this matter.Having said that, I do NOT advocate for War tactics, and my prayers go out to all those who are suffering in Ukraine at this difficult time. Let peace prevail! 🙏
why not show the Russians that support the war so that we can see the two perspective side by side
As someone who has never had to live in fear it's just incomprehensible to me, even more so in 2022. My thoughts are with all of those affected.
Give Crimea access to water and all this goes away....
Old soldiers out there from any race let’s gather arms and bring Russia bleed 🩸 to death with our skills
Putin Terrorist plus
Where is nato now?
United Nation is a farce.
The solution to this problem is much simpler, than it looks: get EU, US, UK, Canada & Australia to completely freeze all financial resources and cancel/reverse dual citizenships of ALL Russian politicians, media officials & oligarchs. Most of those scumbags scream 
Why is the UN still talking? They need military action to be taken, not more useless sanctions.
No to NATO expansion
https://youtu.be/L0G9WRRWIuM
Your thoughts don't help
 @dev stuff  cry more, pussy
 @dev stuff  neither does your spite
We can't. Russia has nukes. I have carpal tunnel syndrome so i can't hold a gun. Please don't make me enlist god damnit.
Panic looks like they where pretty damn calm just traffic sheesh
Fuck these clowns. Let ‘em duke it out.
I am from Pakistan but I support humanity and we pray for Ukraine 😔😭😭
White on white crime
“Whatever Russia says, this attack will not be surgical” is an inflammatory opinion BBC.
the fact is that ukraine is a fake country/ people have been brainwashed they are 
If Russia has an enemy it's because they made it their enemy.
“We will not invade Ukraine” hollow words from a hollow man.
There is civil casualties already? So it is a war
BBC can narrate the conflict like the script of the western elites say but Russia will never allow NATO to surround its borders and threaten its security and nation.
horrible
As 🐼Russia started bombing,NAT👹 Run leaving their diapers. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
BBC propaganda at its best 😂🤣😂🤣
This is the war of Europe, US and Russia, not of Ukraine. I am sorry for Ukrainian people.
Putin must be terminated! This war is his doing!
Now you pray for UKRAINE but nobody ever talk about Syria, Iraq, Gaza, Palestine ETC. ETC.. Part of me believes the whole world is against Putin because he's the ONE real dictator..
Adolf Putin
Люди Украины! Это не наша война, это война злобных жестоких политических свиней, которые решают наши судьбы. Война - это страх, смерть и ужас. Я русский человек, но мое сердце болит за эту ситуацию. Тут нет виновных среди простых людей
Ikr! 😂😂😂 Russia is a peaceful nation that just want to defend themselves from Ukraine! We should help Russia!
Please correct yourself  they're not western leaders they are western jokers.
NATO and zelinsky are the ones to blame for this horseshit
What's the difference between the United States taking Mexicos land and pushed them out. No difference!! President of Ukraine should've layed down. After all Ukraine land once belonged to Russia 🇷🇺
Self defend my foot you freakin bully … you are killing your own people …somebody should just put putin out and everything will end…
I’m russian, I’m devastated and embarrassed 😞
To anyone reading this If God give you power try to help others instead of fighting. World need you
Putin Enjoys suffering. He thinks he will live forever. Oh no he will see the bottom of HELL
Go Russia, about time. Enough is enough.
Self defense does not include civilian casualties.  The future isnt looking too good for everyone.
NATO been egging Ukraine on for years for this. Now it’s happening and Ukraine on they’d own
Damn really crazy stuff happening.
Please stop this nonsensical theory of base less pride of nation and culture and make people to go for wrong choices;the best choice in here was that Ukrainians simply asked Russians coming in that if we don't go for war what would you offer us for economic, political and social stability in for all.
I have no words! I am saddened for them and angry at Putin; greed and power doesn’t make you more special than others, love does. One day this will end because all dictatorships meets a deadline. If you don’t believe me History repeats itself and no communist live forever. My prayers to Ukraine 🇺🇦 THE UNITED STATES IS WITH YOU! We coming to your rescue, hang on !
May God help Ukraine 🙏
See what these propagandists do? 
This is horrible.Praying for Ukraine from Bangladesh🇧🇩.May god bless us all
Everyone must treat Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin as we would treat Adolf Hitler.
I can't describe how furious and helpless I feel as a Ukrainian/Canadian. My heart goes out to Ukraine. And someone needs to make putin  
Another sad day in human history and there are a lot of them
Wtt? Tell Putin to stop this!
Condemnation and sanctions isn't enough and should act according to promise. We support Ukraine
PUTIN.   HITLER.   A.  LIAR.   AND.  A.  KILLER.
vladimir putin is a nazi !!
God, i beg you ,stop the war.
Come on,Israel did even worse to Palestine for years but no one give a damn about it. Now y'all wanna pray & condemn Putin? Hypocrite
Do Russian people all support this invasion? I know lots of them are very nice human-beings. Sad to see the conflict unfolding this way. I hope all these bloody dictators go to hell.
Let’s not forget humanity race…my heart ♥️ with Ukrainian people♥️
Humans ,the only species that looks for their own extinction. 😔 Innocent people suffer so governments and politicians get fame and power
Nothing like demonstrating to Putin why NATO came up to his border. Everybody knew he was capable of this .. it was just a matter of a pacified weak West when it was going to happen. Well now that the United States doesn't have to worry about Ukraine border, maybe they can worry about theirs
It is simple. NATO needs to withdraw its forces from Russian border. Putin will stop everything. But then sleepy Joe is a f*** head and has no balls either.
The commoners.... No.... Many know nuts. They are just working their butt off to feed their family and they got attacked without knowing what happened? Gosh... Don't play the commoners!
It's very unfortunate that western Media never reported civilian casualties when US and NATO invaded Afghanistan, Iraq and other gulf nations. Perhaps they don't consider them as humans.
As far as I know ukraine never threatened russia is ANY way
Putin the new hitler
Not even Russia believes Russia.
Putin's a thug..still remember his 
Support Russia🇷🇺 from Philippines 🇵🇭
Ukraine you worth nothing to US, what he will send you is weapon (u pay), millions of prayer and billions received by sanctions russian account, unfortunately no one will be peace when US still exit.
Vladolf pitler.
Other animals kill each other too dawg.
 @Mr Refried Beans  have you seen them launching missiles at each other of their same kind?
 @skaiu  fair enough.
They bombed the Eastern part of Ukraine of Donetsk Luhanskkilling civilians in 2014 under the O'Bummer Regime.
 @Lesco Brandon  ukrainians did?
One was a Fascist the other a commie, no comparison ya div.
The West are the 21st century Nazi Regime.

Praying for Ukraine, especially the children.

I really cant imagine hearing that kind of alarm blaring early in the morning.
5:49 Koof?
Seems like 2022 is not gonna be a good year
Who is to blame? USA, UK, Soros, Victoria Nuland & Co.
Trying to start ww3 won’t work
The whole world is just starting to recover from the pandemic and it's aftermath. And now this war is going to make things worse for humanity..
Was Wuhan Virus  not enough?
Biden and Trudeau are trying to act tough to Putin but they couldn't even handle a couple guys honking their horns. 🤣
Probably an American missle. Don't believe the bought and paid for soros media. It's all a numbers game to keep the peasants in poverty.....

 @GSR 01  well, it is, just take a car and leave, if you dont have a car, there are plenty of people offering to take you out of the country for a very small fee
I myself am a teen and i have an internet friend in russia. I really wish he and his family is same
Biden Regime has killed 13 Afghan and Syrian children with drone strike missiles…
 @Aye Jae  how can they get out if their airport doesn't exit anymore?
 @Aye Jae  the Russians litteraly disapled all the airports before anyone could leave.
 @SixUnity  the Russian horde sorrounds ukriane.
 @Michael Eli  and Russia bombed multible schools.
 @Michael Eli  Technically although it was a tragedy, Biden never directly ordered it, Putin will soon have the blood of potentially millions of people on his hands for a direct decision.
 @GSR 01  pure stupidity and ignorance if you're warned to leave because were gonna shoot missles and you don't leave
 @GSR 01  that's like staying in a town that needs to evacuate because of a storm I been thru it
 @INFINITY Z  President 
Yeh prayer aint gonna help ..that mythical jesus character apparently only lives in your head
 @Spider Mite Sprayer  biden didnt attack ..its was trump buddy pootin
 @William Jones  You don't know what you don't know.
 @Michael Eli  and putin wants to kill millions, so whats your point
Putin's missle coming for their ass tho no lube necessary
The Russians had them evacuated.The Ukrainian government?
Yea😨:(
 @Michael Eli  and that is wrong too? do you really not get it? are you saying just because biden has children’s blood on his hands it’s ok for putin?
Every inhabitant and friend of this world, hear the alarm of war, the trumpet call of God! For it is a call to repentance from the Lord Himself; a call to embrace He, whom you call Jesus and Christ, as He really is, The Father and The Son are one! The Word of the Lord has spoken to us, THIS last generation. More of this Word at the bottom of this comment;
https://youtube.com/shorts/eCgMVNeko9g?feature=share🙂👆
Two-faced pigs when the Ukrainian regime carried out the genocide of Russians on the territory of Ukraine for 8 years, everyone was silent and closed their eyes. Now, when the Russian army is disarming and destroying the Ukrainian army, everyone is yelling, no need for war, let's have peace, but where have you been all these 8 years? Nothing there, there are terobytes of evidence of the genocide of the president of Ukraine will be hanged as a Nazi and those military men who gave criminal orders. No one will occupy them; all the Russians need is to hang Nazi criminals and disarm the Ukrainian army, then they will return home It’s just that the Western will not be able to explain to their citizens why they sponsored the Nazis
 @NedsoN   pray the EU stop being such pussys
Praying is not even close enough to help people.
Don't worry putin is not like then white people against women and children like they did in Afghanistan and Syria just chill and watch the game 😂
Corrupt Europe donated in the dark, so much is our money, 17 billion euros to Ukraine, the people have not seen one. Do you really believe that Ukrainians are willing to be slaughtered for a bunch of pro-Nazi oligarchs with overflowing accounts abroad or for a puppet who came to power and immediately corrupted? Ukrainians will not fight for these corrupt, Putin knows.
Putin's a world economic forum member. :D
 @Spider Mite Sprayer  thats true ..but we all know who loves pootin ..and its not biden
 @Zzzzember  There will never EVER be PEACE on this planet because mankind's heart is so wickedly evil.
russia will gain thousands of new child models off this, worth. XD
 @SixUnity  you’re a child
 @S  Nope. Nice logical fallacy try. Biden Regime is simply murderous, that is the entire point of the the comment.
 @NedsoN  US shouldve been supplying them with stuff like that suprememly disapoined in biden response
Russia is a bloodless nation that likes to kill civilians.
 @Spider Mite Sprayer  and you think you know anything?theres air in your head,brainless sheep
 @Stephanie Bentham  white people?obama killed more than trump and biden idiot
 @Michael Eli  ‘Murica and Russia should just nuke each other and leave the rest of the world in peace.
Did u pray for donbas children from 2014?
Ya
Same
Nobel Peace Committee are you seeing this?? This is what happens when you give Peace prize to a politician. Now Mr. Putin wants to show to the world who is the actual keeper of peace or on whose shoulders the peace lies safely in Europe. May be you should consider giving Mr. Putin a peace prize. Or a joint peace prize to Mr. Biden and Mr. Putin but that will surely bring Mr. Trump into picture and you should answer him as to why he should not be given the peace prize. So committee, in view of so many families being affected you should revise your policies...I wonder if a prize return from his rival politician will satisfy Mr. Putin's ego...
Prayers do not work and do not help in situations like this. This is real life stuff, please keep fiction out of it
 @Senoritabeatmymeata  Why on a fateful and important day you don't have obstruction like a flat Tyre or loss of wallet...bcoz of the prayers...
 @INFINITY Z  Ok, cool… nothing to worry about then. Random bombs from US👍
 @SixUnity  Putin waged war against his enemies. Biden Regime has killed kiddos with no war authority. Serial Child Killers in the pedo-gone following orders or gone rogue. Which is worse?
Why didn't you pray when America and NATO bombed the mide eate and killed 1,000 civilians and destroy ingrestacure
 @Michael Eli  i dont care about biden, stop acting like sleepy putin is the good guy, ukraine werent the enemy, they didnt do anything to him, he just forgot to drink his dementia pills and had a psychotic episode where he thought that ukraine was attacking him.
 @SixUnity  No acting here. Putin is a hateful murderer… ¡Claro homie!
 @SixUnity  putin doesn’t want to kill millions. Thats actually what America did in Iraq tho Take the lies elsewhere
 @S  he is pointing out that Biden isnt being held accountable heck America hasn’t ever been held accountable for the wars and people they killed recently
Oh yeah okay that’s great go do something about it instead of just pretending like you care you don’t have any idea what a war is with your empty words
Zelensky is too naive and are barking at the wrong door. Be like Afghans, they defeated Russia, the US, and NATO.
 @Michael Eli  Russian air force bombed indiscriminately in Syria, Ukraine will not be different. rRussian Air Force has repeatedly bombed hospitals in Syria in order to crush the last pockets of resistance to Assad. The Syrian Network for Human Rights : Russian airstrikes killed around 5,703 civilians, about a quarter of them children. SNHR: 
 @Aye Jae  Trumptard
praying will change nothing
 @Christian Bozwell  libtard
👍🏻
Jo Bi-Din still hasn't held China accountable for that, don't expect much here.🤣
I just think specially about the children's
Russian and Ukraine ppl are brotherhod
May God bless Ukraine and her people.   My prayers are with them.
AND THE WORLD IS SITTING AND WATCHING ON!!!!!!!!!
This is not only an attack on Ukraine but also an attack on the sovereignty of every small country which finds itself on the borders of a larger regional power. Ukraine will at least get coverage thanks to it being in Europe and support since the issue has been covered since 2014......others such as mine wont even get that if our larger neighbors decide to 
Vivat Russia!
Russians are based
Is America,next?
Russia invades Ukraine west dosent respond, China emboldened invades Taiwan, sounds like the beginning of the end and WW3.
I'm Praying UKRAINIANS Brothers and Sisters to thier fight on  FREEDOM AN INDEPENDENT COUNTRY. GODBLESS YOU ALL 💓🙏🙏🙏
PUTIN IS NAZI.

Very sad i am raining right now cause young people will have to suffer

I stand with Russia not Ukraine... The media narrative portraying Russia as entirely bad and wrong deserve no audience...Wishing fast victory to Russia..
'Unless a nation's life faces peril, war is murder.' — Mustafa Kemal Atatürk
🤦 God bless Them there.
Why ? Why ? How the innocent people over there
Speaking of fiction .Did you know Ukraine has refused for the last 8years to hold elections in Donbas and Lugansk contrary to the Minsk Accord and has instead bombed and shelled Donbas and Lugansk killing 10,000 Russians and has allowed NATO to threaten the safety and security of the citizens of Russia by placing military installations close to the border of Ukraine with Russia contrary to the Astana Agreement of 2010. Who are the outlaws here? What about the famous 3: Ukraine, NATO, and the USA
How come Russia can do this...
Ukraine is playing victim card Russia has serious concerns about state security
Shame    ShameNATO      NATO Please pray for Ukraine and Ukrainian.
NATO and USA are all crap ,only talks,why aren't they intercepting the attacks ,sadly no one is gonna help Ukraine,i hope better future for ukrainians,Russians must not be blamed only Putin to be
lol Ukraine did nothing to you you freak
Why is everybody talking about this as if it's only going to be Ukraine We are looking at the very beginning of World War 3 everyone on this planet will be affected one way or the other
I have to wonder how far Russia will push? Is their goal to go until they can make Russia more defendable from invasion? And then at that point is it purely defense, which is possible or to hold the line so they can go further?
Give me a sec I’ll go talk to putin
THIS IS AN EVIL ACT OF INSANITY !!vladimir putin HAS TO GO , he's a monster !!
All of them are bad? What is the gain besides destroying more of the planet that has to put up with us and let her other creatures die off?
Condemnation and sanctions isn't enough and should act according to promise
 @Islam Arakani Rohingya  NATO and western world is cheated Ukrainian govt. & Ukrainian people.
It would have  been so simple to retreat NATO basis from the eastern,and we could live in peace but they didn't listen,wake up people this is NATO fault all day long
New: Putin announces “special military operation…  aimed at demilitarisation and denazification of Ukraine.”
If trump was president this would not happen, my sympathy to Ukraine. While a toothless united nation sit back and talk about meaningless sanctions  and useless diplomatic chats and talks .
Human wear mask and get vaccine to protect them against virus but is there anything Human can wear or get to protect them against Human?
Chief propaganda media at full display
Instead of fighting back they sending. Thoughts and prayers a fucked up world everythingnis a farce
Russian folks don't want war! ( Sorry for my english)🇷🇺
Send all russians home from London , Spain Cypres and Thailand without there money. Let them be refugees.
Pakistan needs to learn as Ukraine left all alone by USA and NATO to Russia.Same is the case in Kashmir invaded by India.
Don't let your pet left behind.
Imagine if we got updates like this when we invaded the Middle East. Show just how horrid it was
Where Is the west 👀,where is Nato ??? What are they waiting for more innocent people to die ???
Awesome
Putin on his Xbox again...
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 for the citizens of Ukraine and Russia they are innocent it's only the governments around the globe that cause war never peace!
Today I understood that how cruel and selfish the world really is and at the same time that there is no god in this world, , all is the belief of mind.
Joe Biden said, “We’ll take $50,000 a month from the Ukraine for family expenses.” Vladimir Putin said, “We’ll take Ukraine.” #Putin #Ukraine
I support Russia against Europe 😀😀😀
I LOST ALL OF MY RESPECT TO MR PUTIN. I REALIZED YOU CAN NEVER TRUST COMMUNIIIISTTTT
The elites at work
Ukraine shouldn't have attacked ethnic Russian civilians in it's own borders and Ukraine should have honored the minsk agreement. They poked the bear... now the bear is up.
“Protect civilian life” meanwhile he attack and kill citizens
NATO ❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌
@carla v....all these resources you mention and you forgot one,1st place in Europe  they are the poorest country
Putin has done a great disservice to the Russian people and to Ukraine. He is a megalomaniac,  a liar, a spy, a propagandist, a straw man whom everyone fears. He is taking Ukraine just like hitler took his first acquisitions. He is a pig.
Rusia needs to be wiped off the globe and done !
Oh my goodness gracious

Sorry Ukraine, you been had by empty promises by the west especially Uk,Us, France. Lesson learn ..dont trust the west.
Not Ukraine ño Russia is responsible, NATO is responsible 😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠
😢😢
THIS IS SO  SAD.
where is UNO?
Should have stayed neutral! America an EU should have kept their word!
Biden administration: 
Its sad to see Donald's Trump & his followers blame this on Biden when he upheld Purtian. DSA Long live the Divided States of America.
My heart and prayers for the Ukrainian people and soldiers 🙏🏻
I went through war in Yugoslavia my advice for the Ukrain people and their military don’t follow your corrupt president and the corrupt politicians mafia put down your arms because the EUROPEAN Alliance will leave you to die like they did Bosnian people in Srebrenica that got Murdered on their watch. May god help you all be smart don’t fight a Rich man’s war.

Cave man mentality leads to war. This wouldn’t be happening if Trump was in office.
Why did everyone wait until they struck to start leaving? We warned them all and told them to leave the country
The only NAZIs in this situation are the russian dictatorship....
With a pandemic caused by a virus that no one seems to know the root cause, I am not shocked by anything anymore. My heart hurts for the innocent lives.
Russia- we do not want NATO troops, US no we are coming for you. Russia - we will stop you. US - stop inversion. Blame who?

God bless Russia. Putin FTW!!! Got to love white on white murder.
DR Abdul Ali shah/you tube
But why tho? Like what’s the point it’s not like the world doesn’t tend to work together on things nowadays smfh. And Ukraine poses no threat. If that’s the case every other country on the planet poses a threat he just looking for a reason. Putin living in 1800 fr.
Putin is an Illuminati Freemason puppet playing his role. He doesn’t decide what transpires, he’s just told what to do. Sheep eat it up like a chubby kid at a buffet
Ukraine part of russia
Oooh no .Why Putin? I used to like him now he's worse than TRUMP 😢😢
The God of miracle, the God who can make the impossible possible- You are thr only One who can change the heart, mind and soul of Putin. I pray for Vladimir Putin that he will value life more than anything else. All saints and angels be with Putin today and whisper to him to change his mind. War is never the answer to anything. My God and Jesus protect all Ukrainians and Russians and the whole Nato too. Protect everyone in these 2 countries at any cost. Lord You can make anything happen my Miracle Maker. Thank You in advance. To everyone in Ukraine and Russian the world is praying for you... have faith and pray to Him, He always answers prayers. The world is praying for you Ukranian and Russian.
This war is horrible but it’s also horrible for NATO a known enemy of Russia to surround Russia. Because NATO is famous for invading countries and eliminating their leaders and that’s why Putin feels threatened.
If they do any further damage to Ukraine They should be disqualified from the World Cup of every sport,olympics
Man never thought Call of duty story can happen in real life also.
Democratic UNO ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ re-establish UNO ❤️❤️🙏❤️🧡🌷💛🧡🌷💛
Let's go Russia!! Keep winning!
In addition to two super powers, we need a third one which is Russia... Why can't Ukraine go along with Russia supporting hands of Putin... In fact we need an alternate to China and US... China is the 1st culprit of Corona and US is the 2nd culprit on spreading corona... both need lessons. Will Biden accept if some one tries to split US into 10 different nation? What was done to USSR should be repeated to US as well...
Don't sanction Russia they will use nuclear weapons in response to west !!
That pathetic little man Putin. Pure psychopath.
Prayers for ukraine from India 🇮🇳 ❤ 🇺🇦

NOBODY WANTS UKRAINE PEOPLE TO GO TO THEIR COUNTRY?? ...KNOW WHY?
It is distressing!Why the world is filled with troubles as wars between nations, natural disasters and sicknesses? Please listen and I will tell you things to come in which your religions have been hiding all these years from all of you.rrDaniel 12:1rAt that time Michael shall stand up, the great prince who stands watch over the sons of your people; And there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation, even to that time. And at that time your people shall be delivered, every one who is found written in the book.rrLord Jesus sent me, His angel, in this last day to interpret the prophecies in the words of God for the sake of His people who are in the world of Gentiles. rrIsaiah 63:9rIn all their affliction He was afflicted, and the Angel of His Presence saved them; In His love and in His pity He redeemed them; And He bore them and carried them all the days of old.rrIt is been in the heart of the Lord God of Israel to destroy all nations; He will use a country from the north to execute His word. Why would the Lord God wants the Gentile countries destroyed?rrJeremiah 50rBehold, a people shall come from the north, and a great nation and many kings shall be raised up from the ends of the earth. They shall hold the bow and the lance; They are cruel and shall not show mercy. Their voice shall roar like the sea; They shall ride on horses, set in array, like a man for the battle, against you, O daughter of Babylon.rrHaggai 2:22rI will overthrow the throne of kingdoms; I will destroy the strength of the Gentile kingdoms. I will overthrow the chariots and those who ride in them; The horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the sword of his brother.rrHere is the list of your sins that causes for the Lord Jesus to destroy the world you live in: The country Israel is called the holy country for living the Law of Moses as the way of life and governing Law. American government changed the governing law of Israel into democracy, American Christian religion teaches the children of God to reject the Law of Moses, and Hollywood “babylon the mother of harlots” influences the people of Gentiles to reject the holy ways of God and live in pride. Why do you think America and all democratic countries will be defeated in the war? Democracy came from Greek gods. America leads the country Israel and the people of Gentiles to worship Greeks gods and to transgress every commandment of God that Moses had written. The children of Zion are suffering from great oppression, injustice and work hard without Sabbatical Year for living under democratic government.   rrIsaiah 34 rFor the indignation of the Lord is against all nations, and His fury against all their armies; He has utterly destroyed them, He has given them over to the slaughter. Also their slain shall be thrown out; Their stench shall rise from their corpses, and the mountains shall be melted with their blood… Their land shall be soaked with blood, and their dust saturated with fatness. For it is the day of the Lord’s vengeance, the year of recompense for the cause of Zion.rrJoel 3:6rAlso the people of Judah and the people of Jerusalem you have sold to the Greeks, that you may remove them far from their borders.rrMicah 1rFor behold, the Lord is coming out of His place; He will come down and tread on the high places of the earth. The mountains will melt under Him, and the valleys will split like wax before the fire, like waters poured down a steep place. All this is for the transgression of Jacob and for the sins of the house of Israel.rrThe only hope for the world of Gentiles is Mount Zion, Heavenly Jerusalem, the City of the Great King. It is called the JOY OF THE EARTH because it is the place where the Lord Jesus shall stand at His coming and rule the earth in truth and righteousness or obedience to the Law of Moses. The result of living in obedience is peace, long life, and prosperity for an everlasting time. Mount Zion is used to be a part of Israel. After the Jews crucified the Lord Jesus, the Holy Father took it from them and gave it the children of Zion who are now living in the east part of the earth. There an island called Negros in the Philippines shaped as a foot of a man. Isaiah called it PLACE OF FEET OF GOD. At this moment Mount Zion is desolate “does not exist” and no one is helping me rebuild it.r rIsaiah 60rThe glory of Lebanon shall come to you, the cypress, the pine, and the box tree together, to beautify the place of My sanctuary; And I will make the place of My feet glorious. Also the sons of those who afflicted you shall come bowing to you, and all those who despised you shall fall prostrate at the soles of your feet; And they shall call you The City of the Lord, Zion of the Holy One of Israel.rrLamentation 5rThe joy of our heart has ceased; Our dance has turned into mourning. The crown has fallen from our head. Woe to us, for we have sinned! Because of this our heart is faint; Because of these things our eyes grow dim; Because of Mount Zion which is desolate, with foxes walking about on it.rrMatthew 21rTherefore I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a nation bearing the fruits of it. And whoever falls on this stone will be broken; but on whomever it falls, it will grind him to powder. Now when the chief priests and Pharisees heard His parables, they perceived that He was speaking of them.rrOnce Mount Zion is built, there shall be peace says the Lord. He will stop troubles and wars on earth. rrHosea 2:18rIn that day I will make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, with the birds of the air, and with the creeping things of the ground. Bow and sword of battle I will shatter from the earth, to make them lie down safely.rrCome to my YouTube channel where you can click a link to offer an offering of peace.rrLord God of hosts, Holy FatherrLord of hosts, Lord JesusrThe Spirit and the briderMount Zion, Heavenly JerusalemrGabriel, an angel of the Lord
I hope They try to make peace 😥Love from Denmark! 🇩🇰🇺🇦
The only way this ends is with putins demise.
If treasonous Trump was still in the White House he'd be trying to send US troops to help the Russians.Russian govt tries to destabilise,divide and weaken other countries using every dirty trick in the book so they can get away with murder.I shudder to think how much dirt they've got on the Conservative Party by now.
There are no and will never be winner in war. We are all victims of war. Prayers for Ukraine.
Putin is a liar and a war criminal
Who is the DUMB translator and Narrator on BBC ,,??How come u miss translate Putin Word .!!???🤔🤔🤔That is not what he says
Stay strong we are with you! We should not hate Russia for this 99.99% are cevilians that want nothing to do with this!

Ukraine used to belong to Russia so I don’t get why putin can’t ask for it back lol I’m joking
Price to pay to be a dog of usa 🤭🤭
US said they are going to train and arm the ukrainians to fight back.  What?  I've heard this before
#StandForUkraine 🇺🇦
Them house fires. People don’t look scared to me. Fake news
Putin is a deranged psychopath.
What a scumbag move hitting  Civilian flats
Which is why you don't elect mad men to power
So it's normal to just casually stand around & watch it vs trying to run & find safety?
who r you
now who is the terrorist...anyone anything who spreads terror is called terrorist...
Damn shame that such barbarism is still happening today
Funny Putin talking about the denazifaction of Ukraine when his actions are from the Nazi playbook. How did Ukraine threaten mighty Russia by saying we want to keep our independence. 😲what a horrible thought the right to not be communist.
This stupid president Putin is modern day hilter pray for everyone in Ukraine this is shellfish this history repeating itself Europeans always killing each other they can't live In harmony and peice with each other nobody's safe  there always a dictator over there what's wrong with  Putin
No proof it was a Russian missile. Most likely a false flag attack by the west to justify their war to cover up their covid human rights abuse and avoid justice.
Do not harm the innocent people of sin, do not shake the blood of the innocent people of a country because of the sudden wrath of the leaders of the countries, they also have beautiful dreams of sin, we who die will never carry these, but God above is waiting, if the blood of the innocent people is shaken God will punish them. Nature will punish them. So please stop this war. Someone will have to pay for those sins soon God, I say one last time, I want to solve this problem peacefully without fighting, I want to have a happy smile with the people of all these countries, God bless everyone 🙏🙏🙏I am sri lanka 🇱🇰
I sit with Ukraine but Stand With Russia 😂😂
America and NATO forced Ukraine to join NATO and now leave them to face angry russia
Come on now Americans
I hate putting I hope he burns in hell
🇬🇧 🇺🇸 no longer can be brown nosing other nations business.
Down with democracy lets go russia
So he lied & needs charged for war crimes but will whites hold their elites accountable or do what we do in America & ignore evil, corruption & threats like Putin & other evil leaders, law agencies & banks funding both sides of war. Investigate & charge everyone with crimes against humanity & until we actually lock these psychopath leaders & more up it won’t stop. Evil has a organized business in politics, law & government.
Absolutely terrible what’s happening😔
Nice distraction created by America and Russia.
4D chess Biden: 
No NATO 👹👺👹👺👹👺👹👺👹
NATO NUKE RUSSIA!!!
What u mean?
 @notfunnyguy  everything that happens in our world is preplanned and carefully thought about before being done. Our leaders are being controlled by powerful elites nobody ever sees sitting back eating popcorn while the real world falls apart.
 @GROUND LEVEL CUSTOMS  yeah man in my country nepal. The president is about to sell our country to Americans . Probly a war is gonna happen here also. Really scary
 @notfunnyguy  🤦‍♂️ the world is getting even more sick.
 @GROUND LEVEL CUSTOMS  yeh man it's really crazy that this is just a  starting. What can we even do???
 @notfunnyguy  the public can do nothing no matter where you are from its all of us together from every country across the world being punished the ones in charge get  walk free pass. Good luck to you and you're country. From Canada.
 @GROUND LEVEL CUSTOMS  umm wanna ask a question before saying bye.  Do u watch youtube vdo of someone or figure it out ur self? About the information
 @notfunnyguy  I have been researching since I was 11 years old about corruption and what the elites of the world are up to. Yes most youtube but also word of mouth and other search engines.
 @GROUND LEVEL CUSTOMS   soo it's gonna be bad for us no matter what.i tried to tell people about the truth but they don't listen at all. I even get bullied sometimes it's really tough out there
 @GROUND LEVEL CUSTOMS  anyways thanks for chatting with me I fell little better now. And good luck to u as well. From nepal
 @notfunnyguy  yup your always crazy until it happens then people will be silent.
 @notfunnyguy  🤙 😎
Yeah that would be a great idea, third world war, million casualties, destroyed economy, no winner.This will destroy the world!
Very very sad day !!!.
Our prayers from HK are with all the Ukrainians....if the West don't do anything to back down Putin, Xi will take a chance to attack Taiwan for sure
Ukraine is not a democratic country, it is corrupt and run by fascists. They should not have allowed themselves to become the toy of the neocons in Washington. Putin warned there would be consequences and it was pretty clear he wasn't going to back down on this.
Everybody prays for Ukraine.Yeah of course this situation is horrible,but who's praying for those russians? fuck your prays,doesn't help nothin'...
Why war when you can live in Peace in the world?I feel sorry for the children only for them
Terrible mistake from putin , praying for Ukrain 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
Ukraine  President and West responsible for this war
Odessa 5:00 bombing... my 8th yr old daughter asked this morning: daddy is it war... ?
Where nato and the Americans they seam to be full of hot air!!
UNO ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I blame the US liberal media for helping to steal the 2020 election.This would not be happening under Trump.
What a joke Putin has become, proper narcissist, attack first and play the victim.
1:54 in --  see a corrupted President, in the back pocket of corrupt Biden & Son, who made millions off corruption, pleading for help.  He is getting due justice dealt out by the bear.
This is so sad
NATO strengthening caused uneasiness among other european countries especially to Russia..   NATO is a mistake at the first place
Russia 🔥❤
#stopputinnow
this man is an attacker but he play victim of defense himself
I hope it will not escalate to a full world war
What would Trump do different?
 @Bing Bing  under Obama Crimea under Biden (which is really Obama) Ukraine.Trump didn’t appear weak for starters. There’s a reason all was quiet during Trumps presidency.Biden (Obama) giving Putin the gas pipeline emboldened him, and gave him the necessary leverage to pull this off.
Naa I disagree… Putin would have invaded anyways. The difference is that Trump would not have cared. The US president does not SOLELY dictate whether or not NATO would agree to Russia (Putins) demands.
 @Bing Bing  here’s the good news. Now those of you who supported Biden get the feel the consequences.Enjoy…
You support this?They attacked innocent civilians and killed them for no reason. And in Russia you can´t even say your opinion.
Go for it Russia ⚡ warfare reclaim your land and stand up to NATO at the same time
He did it Joe,he did it
As I predicted earlier US and EU will be silent watcher of this war along with Britain....their heroic attitude can only be seen in front of weak countries of Asia, Latin America & Africa...claps for them 👏 👏 👏
There is no more brave nations and leaders to stop Putin. All are weaklings and he knows😞
новости
Where is your usa? Aaaa? How many times we sayed dont play with russia dont support nazis, you promised to take  ukraine to nato now where is your promise when ukraine needs it? Because of you we are fighting with our brothers ukranians, all this blood of our brothers you western anglo saxons will pay.Pu$$ys from washington
Sad to see this is happening in 2022.NO ONE IS SAFE no matter which country you belong to...
It's the U.S and western political leaders that are the cause of this....They can't survive without creating a war.  Shame on people that prefers to see people die because of their selfish gain.
Is ww3 here?
Oh this really bad
🇺🇦 ♥ 😢
From the same source that brought you weapons of mass destruction and the fall of building seven 10 minutes before it happened on 9/11 All staged propoganda because the covid narrative is unraveling.
Putin is a Animal , so sad 😞
Fuck these governments, willing to let us civilians die for some shit war and people will still respect these governments and shit lol never that they ain't done shit for me personally 🤷‍♂️
Putin, needs removed from NATO.  Putin, is a liar and a dictator, along with being a psychopath!  I think the rest of the EU is next... Why should Putin stop,  with just Ukraine...??
The Kremlin sounds like a evil lair
all ukraine fault, should have not allowed nazis to roam freely and threating a global power with nato and muricans.
Lord have Mercy. With my brothers.   This like tiger fitting with a mouse  , king of king. Protect them leon de Juda   .
You people are stupid NATO and America attacked Ukraine and Blaming it on Russia people will have to Die then they'll learn the real truth but it'll be way too late
I wonder if Ukrainian citizens have the right to bear arms?
USA + Nato + UK killed more civilians than WW 1 and WW 2 wars combined.  But yeah i wish Ukranians to stay safe and this to end promptly, if western forces intervene it is game over for Ukraine, it will be cluster bombed as a form of 
Russians and Ukrainian citizens do  not want this . Citizens of the World do  not want this  But those leaders will not listen and will act  according to situation. and so nothing is left but  to survive.
Kinda fake new.. the thumbnail isnt no where near the destruction that has actually happened, trying to spread more fear?
The president of Ukrainian is a world actor and a Democrat. You people in America can you figure that out. He needs to go put down your arms Ukrainian and you'll be safe. Don't listen to the USA they are bloodthirsty Democrats or should I say demon kratz.
I’m ashamed of my United States and nato. We could have stopped this with force to Russia and blow them and Putin all to hell!! It was simple. I don’t get why everyone is afraid of Russia. Putin is a pussy and someone needs to stop him. NATO has all the power in the world and just sits and watch’s!! This is stupid!!!!
Vlad sez sorry…he was aiming for the orphanage
In the blink of an eye, Russia is there. What next?
nice one putin
I have an idea.Both party stop the fight and let the people in the Region of Donbas to choose who’s side they want to go.If the region wants to be Russian. They can secede and join Russia.If they don’t want to be Russian. They can remain in Ukraine.
So it begins.. 😶
Its obvious BBC nareative is very anti-Russian, also the supposed Russian rocket that hit the residential area looks staged! the residential area that they filmed in Ukraine with smoke looks abandoned the apt. building has no windows anywhere and empty is trashy can't anyone tell?
So sorry to seen it!! Please God to safe Ukraine 🇺🇦 people and the world back in peaceful steady please please 🙏🕊
Self defense? Against innocent civilians?  Lord help this man.
maybe im only one that is on Russias side 😂
this  network is anti russian
My hatred for Putin and Russia is about 10 out of 10 right now
Prayers for the people of Ukraine.
we dont hear like we hear chants for israel: israel has a right to defend itself. russia doesn't?
and most ppl in the world really think trump is more dangerous than putin? putin killed 14 000 civilians in the krim island, while trump has 0 kills. wtf is wrong with most of u ppl??????? trump isnt even dangerous like msot of u say. putin is dangerous little dwarf
Something I have been fearful of. I am in the navy reserves and expected to be sent out soon. The media may not have made this clear, but the U.K atleast, were confident of an attack. Thousands of navy troops will be sent after confirmation by nato, they have an ermergency meeting in belgium soon. Good luck to everyone who will be sent out/drafted, hoping to help ukraine.
Putin on command and conquer red alert 3 cinematic scene
Shame on Putin, go down as a Psycho in history, any child been killed you will burn in hell 🤬
We USA will come to rescue them and tear Russia
Where is nato and America
You can't claim self defense when your on the offensive
Y'all ever seen how protesters are dealt with here in America? Even at their most peaceful, they're beaten and arrested.
🥺 This is so tragic.
Fight Ukraine from Philippines 🙏💪💪💪
The pure black smoke out of those planes indicates Russian fighters. I think the Russians use coal in their aircraft.
Rip world superpower :- USA 😭
They need to let Russia do there thing and just attack them as they come, like not send no air attack and hit the planes as they come keep bringing them down one by one, in other words sit still and wait as soon as they appear shoot them done but not risk there planes, i wold do that, i hope everything will resolve soon. This is my idea since Ukraine don't have the same amount of planes and man power as Russia does so take them down from behind close doors, it's like your at home and the enemy is out side well you can see them fist and eliminate them as they approach you.
America bombed Afghanistan Libya Syria Palestine Iraq and killed millions of innocent people. Now BBC and USA is crying with crocodile tears. Shame on NATO USA for provoking Russia into war
It’s happening now , Ukraine military needs to start fighting and not let Russia get any deeper into the country
Where is the UN? If its not doing anything, burn the UN hall and burn its constitution. The world is hoping not to see the face of the 21 st century  . Those who are in power, do something before its too late.
all the world's a stage
Long live Russia
I wish succes to the Ukrainian army, from you Western neighbor Poland.Let's hope our idiotic government doesn't betray the West.
Also are we just gonna ignore the fact that only 24% of the Russian people (who were asked) DIDNT support an invasion of Ukraine?
No mention of NATO. Interesting 🤔
💔💔💔💔💔💔💔
Simple Ukraine cheated by the Nato & US by giving fake support to provoke Russia
SICK PSIHOPATS FROM UK YOU ARE NEXT !
Putin is evil he most be stop
USA will get Russia
Never fear people of Ukraine.. Joe Biden is on top of the situation... Doesn't that little tide bit make you feel safe and secure...?
This msg for whole world 🌎  leave and let leaves
Are there any reports of Ukrainian forces even attempting to defend Ukraine? Are they not going to fight back???
The longer we go without sending troops to support Ukraine the more faith I lose in western governments
Is the pandemic over yet
🇷🇺💪
Fake news
Putin is a psychopath serial killer who idolizes Stalin.
Praying for Ukraine right now.
Prayers to everyone specifically Indian students there
War, the epitome of hell. #Nomorewar #Nomorewar #Nomorewar #Nomorewar
We good in the UK, try it and russia will see fire and brimstone
Do something Nato, send troops to Ukrain to fight with Russian, don’t just talk
And all that because of one dwarfy psychopath Putler...
Use everything you have Ukraine! Bomb Russia! Take out Russian cites!
This is horrible...Good luck, everyone.🌹
Because of this I have seen that all of Europe including Russians share the same views on the occurance. I hope one day Russia will become a true democracy and join the rest of Europe. I know the people of the nation wants that too..
The people with the masks on.....Really?
another mad man out to destroy civilized society!
The word-- Nazi-- is just a clear veiw of war mongers like to use to start killing..We see how the end of dictator go..Kodoffi, Sadam...
Whe people can't live at peace? :'(
The 🦅 of 🇺🇸 will come to save you dear Ukraine 🇺🇦 oh oops I made a mistake it was the USA 🇺🇸 who installed the puppet which as a result caused the Russian attack. 🇺🇸 should be taught a lesson once in for all to not to interfere with nations thousands of thousands miles away. Good 👍
NATO  as betrayed Ukraine , what a shame
Putin said if the soldiers and civilians stand down he wont kill them and putin isnt much of a liar so everyone in ukriane stay safe and stay in your homes
Today is a day which history will remember as the day an ever-lasting peace in Europe was broken by Russian agression...my BEST wishes, Ukraine is not yet lost 🇪🇸❤️🇺🇦
All Russians should be blocked to come in Europe/USA and go to China and other occupied countries.  Sanctions will make Putin laugh, the russians will continue to love and see the blood of Ukrainians, for the sake of the old bolshevik empire.
I think it's time to make Russian glass
Go on Putin, good on you sir, do not let anybody bully you 😉
Cool... can't wait for WW3 go Russia!!
This will be over quick
I’m happy to fight on behalf of the U.K. no matter what action is taken in the future
Putin is a terrorist
https://youtube.com/shorts/eCgMVNeko9g?feature=sharehttps://youtube.com/shorts/eCgMVNeko9g?feature=share
Z world. :D TV War....distractions from 5th session of the Grand Jury Proceedings.
Only Russian public can stop this uncivilized action.
Whare gone USA 🇺🇸 support for Ukraine 🇺🇦
STOP THIS STUPID WAR
All those labs in Ukraine creating bio weapons are about to be seized that sucks
russia great
Snarling what does that mean he isn't
God help them poor kids and innocent people 🙏Putin you and men like you are evil you will get your day !
I’m not to take any side and  💯 for peace !!! But I would like to add that I understand what Putin was saying and translation in picked trough not everything is translated on what he said . For example he said that people been suffering for 8 years and something need to be done . Just saying don’t believe everything u see . I keep track of this from all 3 side USA Ukraine and Russian . There is more to all this !! Praying for peace !
This is what happens when a country puts its faith in that POS Biden.
Joe Biden certified biggest pussy of the century
Bull siht!!
Everyone, instead of just typing that you are sending prayers, pray for real, pray the rosary, it is the only way. 🙏
Self defense, lol. Who's the Aggressor pussy putin
i wonder what Putin thinks about homosexuals... hmmm/./
He’ll never invade Crimea and they did. People also said he’ll never invade Ukraine and he did. We also think he won’t drop a nuke and he will.
RUSSIANS DO MOT WANT THIS WAR!!!Please, I beg you, stop saying Russians want to go war against Ukraine. It is only the government who wants it. I am from Russia. Right now many people here are trying to stop this War because we DO NOT NEED WAR. But the government doesn’t want to listen to their citizens. It even goes to the point that if person shows with “we want peace and not the war” poster, policemen take him away.We have a lot of friends and relatives in Ukraine. We are very afraid for them. In Russia many people are also scared, especially mothers, for their sons and husbands. Nobody wants to die because of the rich people’s greed. Because of the president’s stupid actions there are also a lot of big economic problems in the country. I am scared for Ukraine, my family, my friends and our future. So I am praying for peace and Ukrainian people🕊🇺🇦 And we are sorry for everything that you have been through, Ukraine… Please, stay strong
But it's OK when Israel does the same, or the US and NATO when a country goes against the US petrol dollar. Politicians and media are such hypocrites. You can't satisfy all the people all the time, you can only satisfy some of the people some of the time.
Let me guess, a mostly peaceful protest...I mean war
The question is what Eu and America can do about this issue
No one threatens civilians. This is a special operation against fascists. Fascists are funded by the United States of America
What would the world do if Hitler had to return in another form? Well, now we'll see.
Bs propaganda. They want war so bad so they can destroy this world. All russia wants is nato off its borders. Crimea wants it water supply back that ukraine cut off. All lies and manipulation.
Peace on Earth Please
if somebody took these people out like putin and the leader of china maybe there'd be peace who knows
NATO should stop Putin, if you ask me.
Now declare no flying zone
sad day
Imagine living in a country when you cant protest peacefully ageinst war without being arrested or Harassed by police
Great Britain 🇬🇧 should take the lead like in WW1 and WW2.  Maybe that will get Brandon and VP Idaho administration moving.
World is not a safe place anymore, human creation itself is to fight each other. Shame to the humanity..
Hey hey ,Bidin is gay.
Putin is dog 🐕 🇷🇺 🐖 🐷 Russia is occupant My heart with Ukrainian people ❤ 🇺🇦
Putin’s ass backwards thinking is baffling,yeah let me “denazify the nation” by doing what the nazis did it’s also very surreal
same feeling like US invade Iraq for chemical weapon.
America 🇺🇸 is watching?????
Trump did this.
America practically invited them in by reassuring them that they wouldn't do anything
Rip russia
Good News: Ukrainian military manage to shoot down 6 Russian Aircraft and retook the city of Schastia, killing 50+ Russian ground troops in the process.
china invade taiwan next.
NATO needs to officially leave Ukraine alone, because Ukraine is a strategic military position against Russia, let Ukraine be an independent country and let Russia not have to worry about the  NATO military coalition of multiple countries taking up a position to have an advantage  on Russia.
It's small wonder that this has happened and that the whole world is turning to sh*t. People in this comments section can't even stop referring to countries past wrong-doings when others are sending prayers and best wishes. We fight amongst ourselves even without war.
I’m so ashamed to be Russian now… Today will be protests against war, wish us some luckAnd I’m truly sorry….Peace to Ukrainian people🇺🇦
Putin you liar and scumbag. Hitler of 21st century.
Seems they had been planning this for years
Holy shit NATO is an absolute joke at the moment sanctions won't do shit to stop Russian aggression
All human should gather strongly beside the humanity.
I can't believe that such a full fledged war is happening in 2022.
When u lick western imperial boot pushed russia too far exactly this happens. Hoping for least civilian casualties
pray for ukrain🇬🇦
หมา หัวเน่า คือ ?
At least none can now contest that Putin is a liar and a criminal. I hope the Russian people see the man who leads them for what he is, a snivelling coward of immense proportions.
PUTIN is cc a total GRUB!!
Stand with Russia to attack western imperialism and NATO expansion
Gladimier should be captured and tried for crimes against humanity
It's not even my country I would fight for them.. send me now..
In self-defence! What absurdity! What self-defence initiative involves striking a smaller nation than yourself? Especially one that was never threatening invasion itself.
Good luck brother I pray 🙏 for russians and Ukrainians love from 🇲🇰
Good luck.
💪💪
😂
you are brave. Good luck
Good luck and please be careful and safe
It was in self defence tho
Every Russian is brainwashed and are under putin’s spells and Hypnotism.
Then go to Ukraine,traitor
we know its not the russian people, its all of our leaders. Best of luck to us all.
 @Kev Matt  it wasn't. Stop believing this. This is exactly how WW2 started and how Hitler justified his attacks in Poland.
I wish you luck ✊✊✊✊
ITS.   OUT.  OF.  YOUR. HANDS.  AND.  OTHERS. LIKE.  U.   !!    GOD.   BLESS.  U. ❤️
This is clearly the war of LEADERS and not the people.Nobody wants war and war doesn't make PEACE.The world depends on you, Russians, to at least fight for World's PEACE.Let's pray for NO WWIII.
You are troll or ignorant.
Never blame the people for the choices of their leaders. Hate a government if you truly must but never hate the people they rule over. They are rarely the benefactors of events like this. I hope as many people as possible in the region is able to perservere or successfully evacuate safely.Good luck with the protest!
You better get out of Russia cause there nothing gona be left after we’re done with your country 🇺🇸🤣
Dont be ashamed. Ukranian govt isnt innocent Mary either. The American horrible foreign policy has resulted in this. I didnt believe Russia would invade so soon. I feel bad for the citizens. They are always the casualties of bad policies and stupid ideologies.
https://youtube.com/shorts/eCgMVNeko9g?feature=share
 @Kev Matt  no putin could have threatened and make ukraine brain dead president  submit to fair terms. But this invasion make him the offender  No discussion  about it .
Why, my friend? You reap what you sow.
Try not to get shot by OMON. And good luck. If there’s an outpouring of support there from Russians themselves, at least we’ll know Russian state media really is full of shit with their “polling”.
PLZ HELP.Dont let this end up to a Ww3
 @Kev Matt  In Ukranian land? What a CLOWN....
Its not your fault you did not start or want this take care
 @Kev Matt  SeLf DeFeNcE waaaa I'm Russian and I'm scared of UkRaInE. No self defense would be staying in your borders and not killing innocent civilians in a very stupid game. You look dumb.
Shame to west. They backstabbing Ukraine. They fleed
Your doing the right thing! 💪🏻✌🏻
My prayers are with you
Don’t be. This is a politicians war. I hope you guys stay safe as well. This is all so sad to see.
Good luck and stay strong, we know most Russians are decent and peaceful people
 @Kev Matt  it is not in self defence, Russia attacked themselves trying to make it out like Ukraine did this to have a reason to invade, why would Ukraine attack Russia if they don’t want to be invaded, it is just propaganda, take what the Putin says and other Russians say with a grain of salt.
Don't be. Putin has had the Russian political system on a choke hold for decades, and political opponents who posed a threat to his power have been assassinated in front of the Kremlin. There's hardly any room for dissidence, and I applaud your bravery for standing up for your beliefs and the Ukranian people.Please take care.
 @Kev Matt  no, it was not, putin has lied many times
Nothing will change while the short bald dictator is in power.  He needs to removed like Mikhail Gorbachev's birthmark.
Im so sorry this is all so sad for everyone, may god be with you
Its not your fault. Its your government’s fault.
 @George  That's such a stupid thing to say! Civilians are not to blame, Russian or Ukranian. I read they've been warned not to even protest against the invasion or else they will be prosecuted.Please don't say such ignorant things from the confort of your couch, thousands of kilometers away! These are people, on both sides. You may be desensitized to guns but that's not how we do it in Europe. This is not a joke so please move your laughing emojis somewhere else.
The world has no hatred for the Russian people, we know its your dictator Putin that is to blame for these atrocities.  The world wishes the Ukraine people and the Russian people freedom.
SOLD OUT MOFO! Be patriotic!It's your soldiers putting their lives on the line for you. These is the difference between the west and other countries. when the US and NATO go to war everyone even mainstream media celebrate
This is the fault of your government, not your people. It's very clear from the public response that it is so. It is up to like-minded Russians like you as well as anyone who can to do what we can to try and bring this war to the quickest end possible.
 @George  Украина же ваша колония, так почему вы не заступитесь за Украину?  Или вы умеете воевать только за клавиатурой? 😉
 @Andrej Kolosnjaji  and russia is not putin  . Putin is a cancer to russia  who have stolen hundred of billions of dollars of russian money and will cost you more life and all of putin supporters should go flick themselves it is against your interest to invade ukrain but you putin sidechicks  are a burden to your country.  You should have forced them through threats not direct action that will forced them to counter and make them more willing to join nato . Putin  is not russia and russia will reap what putin saw and you will enjoy decent hardships now
You needn't be sorry brother
Putin knows your location
You do not have to be ashamed of where you are from. Only what you do. I hope you get your way in your protest. Love from Finland🇫🇮
 @Kev Matt  what the fuck did the ukrainians do to DESERVE THIS SHIT??
Tell your president we don’t want a war!
 @T-NOX Gaming  yeah. This is the exact thing as in the start of the Winter war. In the winter war russia shot itself and blamed us finnish people. It happened again. History repeats itself
stay safe at the protests and thank you
 @Felineintuition  I wonder if George actually knows if it goes as far as he seems to want it to he isn't safe on the comfort of his couch.
 @Flash357  it would have been self defense if ukrain actually crossed the line  and was preparing to join after a threat and reasonable demands . Which    ukrain won't do( preparing to join nato) if putin offered that  .but he was mobilizing and escalating and he forced them more to it. He could have simply forced ukrain our of nato without any military . But he wanted an excuse to invade for his own personal gain not for   russia.So these putin kiss @$$es can go to please him as the who** that they are .
My family  has ties to the russian  establishment  and we are all shocked.  No one even people  in the know expected this to happen. From  what I can gather this was purely  a push from putin.  Even top top  officials are distancing  themselves  from him saying this was all 
It's your government leaders not the Russian citizens.
Thank you for protesting! Nobody wants war. We will do all we can over here in the US. God bless!
Thank you. Do you live in Russia? Please protest if you do. Russias people must speak out against their leader.
 @Kev Matt  wtf are you smoking
 @Boniface  Lmao. So you think it's ok to invade other nations?You oligarch boot licker.
Fake russian😒 saw your account info from uk
Dont do it death is available for that stupid decisions i suggest to just stay at home as much as possible and stay safe, i dont think putin is playing around, and protests isnt gonna cool him down
 @ɴᴏʀᴛʜᴇʀɴ ʀɪᴠᴇʀ  russian bot alert
Fug russia ..yall bout to get that azz spanked ..nobody even likes russians except trump
 @George  🛑☄️Your a Moron!! This isn't a video game stupid. We both have nuks.... don't you understand we're not invincible no one wins with WAR!! ☢️🕛ONCE the button is pushed, it's 💥over.☠️ PERIOD‼️🦁💥🐻💂This is the GOG MOG War! The beginning of the end.... yea, hilarious 😂 George... 🤬 idiot!
I wish you all the best. Thank you for putting yourself at risk and doing the right thing.
 @Kev Matt  how?
Don't even waste your time with protests. Your psychotic excuse for a president has banned protests and several people have already been arrested. Victory against that madman will cime, but at a terrible cost.
be careful not to be snuffed out by the police, best of luck friend
 @William Jones  Oh another moron... Surprised! 🚫
traitor like you should be ahamed ..when your country is bullied by NATO
You’re not a Russian. You’re just an imposter
 @George  there won’t be nothing left of America either lol 😂
you're a traitor to mother russia then. gtfo and go to your beloved west then
 @Ivan Voronov  If even the top official do not support these actions, then they should do something. If everyone around Putin disagrees with this step, they should stop immediately and not obey him. Putin without support is just one man and just a man like everyone else.  Wishing all those who disagree with Putin to grow bigger balls than him. Putin has gone completely insane... At this point he is a mad man.
If you see Putin, knocked that idiot out.
We humans need to fight against evil people .. we have only one earth
давай до свидания тогда, Чемодан, вокзал, Украина!
this is all NATO & UK & US & EU's fault  THEY made Ukraine go to war!  so why for example Nato didnt stop TUEKY INVADING NORTH CYPRUS OR NORTH SYRIA OR NORTH IRAQ (Kurdistan) and others?!!  so see they only want their benefits and Russia despite i dislike them but they're obstacle to US & UK & NATO & EU benefits!! its not about human rights at all!!
 @George  are you gonna be in the front line dumb f
 @SpiritDragoness  I agree.  I don't know how likely ( probably  not at all )this is but I know  that a coupe attempt is possible. I know that some are thinking  about it atleast. The general consensus  is  from government officials 
Ты предатель. Надеюсь тебя найдут и воздадут по заслугам за эти грязные слова.
Come on Russians, you need to stand against your government, this is your chance to remove him. Stand all together against this tyranny and stop it. Why are you all just sitting in your homes like your country isn't doing the worst crime! You need to realise people have power against this fool clown of Putin, pretending to be a president. He is not worth of anything. He is an idiot. Stop saying and pretending like you can't do anything. POEPLE HAVE POWER, not Politicians.
 @T-NOX Gaming  Brush up on your ability to process sarcasm
Good luck
 @Clonker bonker  incredibly off topic, but I just wanted to say I love your user name 😅 in a sea of sad comments it managed to make me chuckle, thank you 😊
Why would you be embarrassed. You belong ot a country with a sophisticated nuclear arsenal.
Good luck, stay safe!
 @Felineintuition  pretty sure you’ve said plenty of stupid stuff in your lifetime 🤪 well that president shouldn’t of made a dumb decision on behalf of Russians 🤪😂🤪😂🤪
 @Артем Мельников  I don’t speak bum 🤣🤌🏻😅🇺🇸
 @Joshua Ortega  okay joshy 🌎🇺🇸
 @Keith Edginton  Oh shut up. That wasn't sarcasm. You realised that you fucked up and now you won't take credit for it. How was your comment implicating sarcasm?!
wish luck for you in order to fight such an filthy govt
 @ɴᴏʀᴛʜᴇʀɴ ʀɪᴠᴇʀ  I didn't say I was Russian.
 @Virupasan Balanathan  Please educate us on the bullied part🤭🥱
Good luck
 @Derrick Larsen  Fox News will ease any of those concerns.
 @Тевтонец  Если ты считаешь что предатель это человек который открыто выступает против войны с братским народом, против разрушений детских садов и жилых домов, против разрушения экономики РФ( привет дефолт) и против смерти наших бравых солдат, которыми командует узурпатор с 20 летним стажем, то видать действительно я предатель и злодей. К слову, когда Николая свергал Ленин, считался/считается ли он предателем? Или тут действует принцип «вы не понимаете, это другое?» Немцы которые выступали против действий Гитлера ради сохранения их собственной страны считались предателями родины? Или действовали для ее сохранения?Я люблю свою страну, но ненавижу государство. Сегодняшние действия несут вред нашей стране и нашему народу. А так же народу братской нам страны. Если для тебя я предатель, а Путин герой - иди нахуй «по-братски» и продолжай наслаждаться Соловьевым, Скабеевой и Киселёвым.
 @George  Glad we've determined you're speaking idiot language.
 @Clement Okoro  It is not true. There are also intelligent and sensible Russians too who do not approve nor support Putin.
Protesting only works if your opinion means anything to the people in charge. Stay safe and seek the change you can actually achieve.
No don't be ashamed to be Russian be ashamed of you're government you do the right things and everything will be alright. It is totally normal to feel sorry for others but don't blame yourself.
 @Kev Matt do you honestly believe that Ukraine that is A LOT smaller country than Russia and doesn't have a huge army like Russia would purposefully attack Russia? People like you are either insane or a little slow and because of that very easy to brainwash by Putin and his pathetic allies. Russia did the same thing to my country Finland in the world war II, the morons claimed that WE attacked them and that gave them right to try to invade our country. Russia is a country full of psychopaths who enjoy killing.
 @MsShell T  oh another trump voter ..dumb azz
 @Scardee-Cat  thank you, and your username is really original as well. Have a great day
 @Ivan Voronov  I hope it is just a matter of time before something will change in Russia. Russia is a beautiful country and I wish only the best for it's people. Putin is ruining the reputation of Russian people. And I am afraid he will not stop with Ukraine unless someone stops him.  My dad is part Russian part Mongol.  That makes me part Russian. I am bi lingual (tri lingual if you add English too), I have a mother tongue and Russian is my father tongue... So i know how to curse in Russian... Lol. Oh shit, I just understood why NATO is not helping Ukraine... Coz if NATO helps, then Putin  will use that as an excuse to attack NATO countries like the Baltic states.
 @souravdas81  Shame shame on Russia for following the criminal Putin to attack and invade Ukraine, a sovereign independent country.
 @Dominic Cornwall  why bro? Where are the promises?
 @Dominic Cornwall  why the UN is dumb, where the NATO hidden. Only big lecture of Bieden and Jhonson
 @Felineintuition  haha yeah. It doesn't even take much easing. Many probably think the Russians just use firecrackers 🧨 🤔.
You'll need more than luck based on what was shown what happened to protesters in the video.
Your ashamed to be Russian? Зараза ты.
 @Clement Okoro  lol just like every single American is brainwashed since the bush administration - just know that America built an army base in Ukraine, close to Russian borders with weapons pointed. This has been going on for 8 or so years. However now that this war has started now convenient there is no more American troops in the bases their built in Ukraine. Don’t come out of the wood work like you know anything
 @George  Russian will destroy America - it’s about time someone teaches America to stop being the antagonist of ever war and then being the hero’s. Like how america claimed they won world war 2 abs are the heroes. Bish please. They didn’t even fight until the war was basically over lmao
 @SpiritDragoness  you know how to curse in Russian - what accomplishment
 @Ghuijy  not only, I am actually fluent in Russian. By the way, Russian has many curse words that can be very confusing to non native Russian speakers.
2:37 prayers to that mustang guy hopefully he’s on e so he can outrun the tanks and the helicopters
nato has the troops to overwhelm russia in days or weeks..i dont get it. sanctions just cause wars
Many people heart goes to Ukraine but after some days everyone will forget about it, and pretend nothing has happened.
Crimes against humanity. My heart cries for Ukraine.
Fuck putin! He’s power tripping! He is willing to kill millions just to get what he wants. Fuck You Putin!
Ukraine to Russia is what Belgium and Poland were to Nazi Germany
I will fight for Russia if they let me in. - A refugee
There is no protest Russia absolutely not
Really happy to see the Kievan brothers are being rejoined geographically thanks to sir Vladimir and the Russian soldiers and liberate Ukraine from the grasp of so called coalition of NATORussian is the true superpower 🔥🔥🔥
The Russians support their dictator they must live with it.
How is this self -defence??? Is nobody going to stop this mad man??? He’s basically our days version of Hitler ….
America and Nato will not help. Get on with it. US is scared of Russia. US is a pussyRussia is a chad

this is peacekeeping? shame on the russian president. stay safe and strong, my ukrainian friends. the world is watching and is with you !  🇨🇦 ❤️🇺🇦
Biden just assured me that there's still plenty of time to talk .Meanwhile Ukraine is pleading for us to get involved.. (that is Putins ultimate goala for the West to get involved..or to prove politics are.more important than common sense)
There is only bomb and missile in ukrine but not in mosco or Russia.Even  palestians use 50 rs rocket agaist Israel. 🤔🤔🤔
False Propaganda News Against Russia By The Hypocrite BBC.
Enemies of human civilization: The governments of Russia, China and North Korea
I saw Putin play hockey before. He's a total pμssy.
Where is Nato now?? Fuel war than leave this small peaceful country to fight the nuclear power.  What rong if ukraine does not join Nato, western countries have esp Nato have ravaged African countries and financed wars now when they have to fight super power they run with their tails at the back

Wish both country to be peace 👍
Why fighting? We all know how much damage and lost from ww2.
Best way to save these people is to surrender as early as they can, 
#putinhuylo
I live in Ukraine, Zaporizhia🇺🇦 I woke up from a terrible roar at 5.30 in the morning. the glass vibrated from the shock wave, it's terrible. We collect things all day, but we don’t know where to run, there are traffic jams everywhere, the child is scared. I pray that this ends. Amen.
Who are spoilers of course America and uk...
I noticed that they don't talk about the Nazi infiltration of the Ukrainian Fighters in Western media.
Where is disrespectful NATO ?When NATO's contribution will appear in the name of help for Ukrainians?It is believed that  NATO is thrillingly enjoying Putin
Do you consider yourself Chinese?🙄
Just have Nuclear weapon Taiwan.... Don't rely on the US
Taiwan now invaded by china and back to motherland
China will take Taiwan
Soon ur people will face similar circumstances
Nato this this and the west using Ukraine as a tool
 @Green Scenery  They just said Taiwanese not Chinese... So, what do you think?
 @Green Scenery  Stupid question. 🙄
 @Jefferson Jeff  Lmao nice try CCP bot
 @Daniel Wessels     Taiwan people are Taiwanese .
 @Debayan Ghosh  that just stupid if Taiwan got a nuclear weapon is will the cause for china to invade, it basically when Cuba try to get nuclear weapon, plus they got a nuclear weapon US would be pissed and the US navy is the only thing that china is afraid off

 @Ed H  I know. I was just asking that guy.
 @Spentrav  stupid reply 🙄
 @Jefferson Jeff  +1000 social credit!!!
You know Winnie the Pooh would be smart if he were to invade Taiwan soon since the US is too busy. I hope it won't happen to you but it's a very real threat.
God bless Taiwan and CCP go to hell.
Z world. :D TV War....distractions from 5th session of the Grand Jury Proceedings.

Let's hope the west doesn'tLet you down too. Taiwan isThe real China, we shouldCrush those commie dogs.China is evil and wants to take Over the world. All civilizedNations should put an embargoOn Russia and not buy or sellAnything to them untilPutin is overthrown. He isA murderous pig, the best insultIs he is as bad as Hitler.
 @Martin Jenkins  agreed.
Prop-O? Just wish I could trust media.
It is time to listen to the little folk.. it is always the little unimportant folk who pay the price and if they are saying this could be the start of World War III then it is time to stop it before it gets to that level!!
Nobody would have said a word if this happened in any muslim country
BBC Bullshit-Bullshit Channel
Now we see how NATO has been training the Ukrainian army for 7 years. 
My heart goes to Ukraine for this one 🇺🇦
shock， terrible people donnot want war！
This is fucked up. Putin jus lied to the world. I bet no consequences. They probably feel like my ancestors back in the day. I wonder if the world cared about that btw 🤔. Prayers to Ukrainian families
Sorry, to busy fighting for my rights to care.
What is Nato doin??
I support the Ukraine people but not it's government , they're some of the worst leaders in the world , ask them where all the opposition leaders went after the election , shooting down passenger planes and dictatorship values through and through . The people of Ukraine need to be freed of this , and I pray with as few casualties as possible
So where exactly was the fireball at the airport????
I do care for the situation in Ukraine and innocent people losing lives. However why not ask where is US and UK after leaving Ukraine in this mess. As usual they have proved they can't be relied
Evil putin
Good job there Joe…you Schmuck!
What a load of bollox it's just a smoke screen
We stand with you Ukraine, and with the poor innocent souls dying for their nation...🇪🇸❤️🇺🇦
Let's hope Russia bombs the new world order into dust and takes out the nazi led army for good
Yes  I agree with you.. we do not need anymore cemeteries filling up with the innocent or what they call collateral damage for the greed of leadership . On my knees praying this stops .

 @zoro zoro  Exactly. The US is to blame
@UCJZT_bW13hDVHlfn6yHk6eA The US is causing all this and they sit comfortably at home on the other side of the ocean
Z world. :D TV War....distractions from 5th session of the Grand Jury Proceedings.

So did russia really suffer more casualties than ukraine?
I love Palestine🇸🇩🇸🇩 but the British and the USA has ruined it

No gaypride this year?
Why the US and the Western do not mobilize their forces. That's repeat the Nazi invadion.

Fuck Russia
DEATH TO RUSSIA. DEATH TO PUTIN
Appeasement failed

Putin is using the same excuses that Hitler used to move into the Sudetenland.
Demilitarization? This guy going all out then
Where is NATO? nato pushed you so hard in this shit becouse of their selfish interest. They put Russia against the wall, and you listen your master like a good puppies, now face your consequences. Full support to Russia. In the white house they are now drinking and celebrating for successful mission.  I am very sorry for ukrainian people.
Fuck BBC news
My God... the ppl cannot even evacuate anymore bc no airport
Ukraine has earned, join Russia!
It's a psyop, the WEST bombed the airport on purpose.
Peace is better than war in what ever situations.
PUTIN IS THE NEW HITLER, A THREAT TO WORLD PEACE, STABILITY AND PROSPERITY. PEACE LOVING NATIONS MUST BOYCOTT RUSSIA TO STOP PUTIN FROM BULLYING ANY FURTHER.
US Europe will sanction Russia to even poor than  india  in gdp per capita.

Most middle east countries living that way everyday, and most countries in africa living exactly the same.
That’s how Syrians  🇸🇾  Are living for more than  10 years
 @Indra Kurniawan  still, not the same as the fear of being obliterated by a 1000kg bomb
 @Clonker bonker  is death by 1000kg bomb worse than death by drone strike?
 @kingbreaker  guys shut the hell up  just have prayers for all people suffering in the world
where have your hearts been for the past 8 years while western backed fourth reich gangs attacked east ukranians? The BBC are a state funded terrorist cartel!
 @Clonker bonker  european cry babies 🙄
 @kingbreaker  well, i would not like to be hit by a bomb, see my family die, my city in ruins, burning, in ashes. I am not from ukraine, but i would rather take the drone
 @Clonker bonker  my guy death is death irregardless of how much pain you went through
 @kingbreaker  well... yes.
This is how Palestinians feel every day and have been for decades, America is funding and supporting Isreal while they do the same thing to Palestinians, this is also what people in Yemen are going through, America is also funding that.
Ireland welcomes and stand with Ukraine, putin is a bully
Russia has legitimate reasons to secure Ukraine.
There's alot of man that could fight wtf.. fight back grab a gun
Never believe what you HEAR AND ONLY HALF OF WHAT YOU SEE
i so port you all:thanksdoc::thanksdoc:
I didn't see Ukraine  attack Russia! What is Putin talking about?
After loss of life through Covoid the world can't afford this disaster worse than Covoid19
As a Front-line  i stand with Ukraine (india)
People are seem to forget that the people you are standing behind aka NATO and America have done similar acts on the people of Serbia in 1999.
May there be peace
So sad what's going on but people wake up Biden and his government is behind this his showing to the world that he is against it but his mot
USA need to leave europe.
This is insane
Free RUSSIA 🇷🇺
US & UK and their puppet NATO are the real perpetrators. Denazification of Ukraine.
Interesting footage... At the airport the guys have no fear whatsoever when the bombs hit. After we see the blocks of houses, where are no windows, but the building stands perfectly, not a sign of a bomb... How is that possible?... The Ukrainian minister fears for his job?? Wtf! Does he not fear for his people?... People in Kiev woke for b.mb siren and we are told many b.mbs hit. Why are we not shown the devastating pictures?... Protests end with people getting arrested. Hm interesting... Isn t that what is happening in Canada??!! Protestors being arrested, their bank accounts frozen etc because they went against the Canadian government... We know there are heavy fighting, the riporter says, yet we are showing a street where there is nothing happening... Who the f.ck believes this bullshit?????!!
If Putin is worried about Russia security why doesn't Ukraine promised Putin that it will never attack Russia.
i support russia from india 🇮🇳
Big heart for ukraine from🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵
No one will like your comment
 @Alan Liang  1 now
Denazification? Geez, what gibberish.
Aginst the whole democratic world... Smb missed the last 2 years apparently.
Putin is a warmongering psychopath
How can a country as big as Russia do this to a country as small as the Ukraine it’s a pity Putin couldn’t catch Covid-19 and die of it
Ukraine was a great country
don't believe what the media is saying its all part of the nato and eu to westernise and nato-ize ukraine which will effectively put NATO & US on russias front door step, controlling assets that flow through russia and putting russia in danger of US control. this whole ordeal is US/NATO/EU agenda to make a international government and the media is their biggest weapon. Think about it, think of all of US/NATO/EU occupations and bases around the world. they are slowly expanding their influence and control over the entire world. Speaking of an International Law, US contantly policing other countries... think people think!
My heart bleeds 🩸🩸for the civilians
Praying is useless! Just watch the fellowship of the rings and you know what will happen soon to other countries! Even UK, France, Germany and USA!All human beings are dreaming when the nightmare is not a dream but reality that will come to everyone in the near future! Now Putin, tomorrow Xi, Kim......!When will people understand a war in the far side is actually a war with them, sooner or later!
Omg!!!! This is unbelievable in this day and age!!!!
This is so bad .... very bad. This will not be good. This brings me to tears 😭
I myself am from a country where war ( civil war ) is going on and I know all kinds of wars only bring destruction and  sufferings.....There power-hungry leaders only know how to wage the wars for their own interests while ignoring the sufferings of the people....I am really sad for Ukrainian people and May their cause prevail .... ❤️ From Myanmar
The fighter jets are fortunately ukranian
Should have listened to Patton.
Meanwhile, the American Republican Party praises Putin🤢🤮
🇰🇭🇰🇭
Lets goooooo whooooooo
Oooooh, Russia 'bout to get in trouble.
It's Putin's war. Dragging down everyone else for his greed while blaming others for his wrongdoings.
NATO stop talking start doing, NOW is the time to act
stay safe
Praying for P E A C E ...
I honestly thought Putin was better than this...stoopid me
i can’t comprehend the fact that putin as a fellow human living in the same earth breathing the same air,having a family of his own would do this to other fellow humans.It’s too much for me to understand
Putin will carry the legacy of lenin and stalin


Putin is hilarious. Calling them nazi’s and saying they defended themselves. 😭😂 who tf is he trying to trick with this??
Croatia IS WITH YOU Ukraine ❤❤ stay strong
And why do you show Kiev, where civilians are not killed. Why haven't you shown Eastern Ukraine for eight years? Where ordinary people were killed?
Bbc's reporting is biased.
Why, Why, Why, because 1 man is crazy !?=!?!!=! GOD please STOP THIS WAR !!!!!
What the F!!!!! FuUUck you Russia 😡
Nobody can stop it cuz its already been written its been long been told the end is near God is coming.
Stay Safe Ukrainian People 🥺
oIo Putin
Praying for innocent people killed by NATO in Libya, Syria,Iraq, Palestine, Afghanistan, Vietnam, Sudan, Somalia and many more..
Heart wrenching days for the helpless civilians who are by now refugees in disguise
It’s sad to say this but I think Ukraine already lost the war
Make love, not war. Or fight with pillows. Idiots. I am shame to be a human.
Ukraine wanted to join Nato. Reap what you sow.
Evil, money and power. No soul.
He was trying to say he was defending russia from the Europe encroaching closer and closer to russia if ukraine joined nato. Still he's a pos for invading them. Paranoia at its finest.
Calling them Nazis while doing Blitzkrieg and oppression of free speech and anti war demonstrations literally threatining anti war protestors with prison right now. Only kreml bots, People with an IQ of 70 and below and People who hate the US and Nato so much, they would love to build concrentration camps there, would still support Putin.
He is just using Nato as an excuse to invade.     Nato is not threatening Russia, its the other way around
He lies. He has always lied. Everyone who is not with him is against him and a Nazi... Even if you are a Jew and in no way can be a Nazi, you still are a Nazi. That should say a lot about his personality and his view of the world. He lies, he twists the information and laws and history to his advantage, and only his advantage alone, screw Russian people, he don't care about them either. He just talks that he wants to protect Russian people who live across the boarders. But it is all a lie. They will be casualties of his aggression too.The Russians have a programme in place that is supposed to encourage the Russian people to return to mother Russia. They promise to help resettle, a free apartment for a year or so untill you are financially stable................ Guess where the promised apartments are? In cities that are long forgotten and abandoned that they are no longer accessible by road cause the roads have been eroded by winter frost and lack of maintainance. The infrastructure in those cities has long collapsed, there are no jobs, no shops.... Nothing, just ruins of old factories that haven't been in use for decades. That is how much he loves his Russian people. I have a few Russian friends who actually looked into it coz they though of moving to russia coz most of their relatives live there. Once they found out the conditions, they were shocked. They decided to apply for our citizenship instead. They live in a great city, have a great job and all the comforts they need... Why would they want to abandon all this to go to that dump?
Ever heard of the Cuba missile crisis?

I support the Donbass people's right to be independent, but Putin is in the wrong here and went too far. He should've just went for the ones shelling the region and stopped there. Instead, he went on to try and destroy the entire Ukrainian military. I see the Russians losing here and already are losing. It's gonna be like Chechnya in the 90's again but worse. The Ukrainian people are united and are giving away Russian positions entering the country blindly. There are videos out there, Ukrainians asking the disorganized Russian troops to stop and go home. Had those civilians been armed would've easily just destroyed them on the spot like the sitting ducks that they are. This is a war Russia already lost.
Dang wh1te people dont like peace, chilling and smoking blunt. Just wanna k1ll for no reason. At least in da hood we fight abt something
😢
I am from Russia and I am shocked. This horrible decision to attack our Ukranian brothers is made by mad idiot Putin. All forces of Russian propaganda are trying to close people's eyes, but position of our president is weaker than ever. I am sorry for what is happening and I am 100% convinced that we're on the bad side here, but noone asked our opinion on that decisions.
Drama queens
Solution: The Ukrainian soldiers stay calm and do nothing. Russia will not do any harm.
Why the free world waits till the last minute  to help,why not build up nato as soon as problems start,the hypocrisy of democracy.......why do free country's still trade with communists country's.....shut them out....give Ukraine back its nukes
Am in serious tears seeing this as far from Nigeria...
Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.Prayers from Pakistan, to all the Ukrainians
US is the enemy of peace in ths world
Russia how we can help you to concor the West and make the world better, GO PUTIN GO RUSSIA!!
World war is coming nice knowing you all rip earth
Prayers for ukraine 🙏🏼 from philippines
Please my Heart goes to Everyone on both sides, please 🙏😢 stay safe 🙏
and thats what he thinks to their sanctions. Poor civilians will suffer.
The West is a traitor to Ukraine
I was one of those people heavily doubted he would do it but here we are putin just lost all credibility with me, power to the Ukraine military hope you prevail.
This is the saddest part of the war. The attacks in its majority are inflicted on civilians.  Politicians and military forces should confront each other away from civilians. Now is more dangerous than ever. With weapons of mass destruction in place, we all can be annihilated.
Pray for what? Your P.M is there blowing Putin!

@Edilbert Fernando we are not our leaders. Not all russians like this war. Not all pakistani do what you just said. We are in the era were we can talk all across the world, they are a citizen of the world and also is living in Pakistan.If you don't respect them, you are part of the problem.
 @Leo The Lion  Oh please save me your rhetoric dude. Your words ring hollow when your elected represenatative is busy creating an axis with Turkey and China. Being a global citizen is an illusion and every nation needs to take collective responsibility for the leaders it votes to power!
Your destiny is not so different
you should know better with all the children murder by the Obama regime's drone program! BBC are state funded terrorists!
We know what NATO US did with middle east killing millions so dont tell me Russia is bad .The only rule the world follows is power
 @Edilbert Fernando  you've got a problem with that? Maybe he could convince Putin to pursue peace.
 @Vintage Jock  Putin doesn't give a left nut about Pakistan. Being a former KGB officer am sure he remembers :)
 @Edilbert Fernando  Not every person voted for the leaders of their countries. Unfortunately many times the current leaders either got the majority vote or changed the votes, like what Mugabe did in Zimbabwe years ago. Or because people are stupid like here in Namibia. For years people voted for Swapo even though it was obvious what they were doing, being corrupt and pocketing millions of dollars for themselves.
 @Edilbert Fernando  don't you know pakistani have two masters one is china another Russia
 @Leo The Lion  pakistan are hateful war mongers who hate Hindus they should be nuked
 @Edilbert Fernando  agree ia m from India Pakistan pm took no time bowing against Putin because their master China order them
I guess Russia did not get the left-tards memo about hurt feelings, hate, wokeness, and rainbows, and unicorns.
I am not supporting the war.  But i badly want to see the NATO countries in  flames for destroying the Middle east. RUSSIAN are doing the same what the Western Hypocritic did to the Middle east and Afghanistan
Neo nazis have taken a foot hold in Ukraine that's a fact

This is Rusia telling to western world that Ukraine is theirs no matter what. All anti- Rusia important people of Ukraine would do good to flee or they will be dead soon. Nobody can help Ukraine.
My prayers goes to the  all the soldiers and  to the innocent civilians 😞
🇺🇸👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿👿
Putin is gay
YEA RIGHT YOU HAVE SAID RUSSIA HAS BEGUN SOMANY TIME? THIS IS DUMBAS AND KEIVE! AREA'S IN QUESTION! PUTIN RECONIZED THEM TO THE UNION SEVERAL DAYS AGO! TECHNICALLY NOT UKRAIN MORE RUSSIAN TERRATORY.
will UK and US cooliation drop bombs like they did in middle east?
I have high doubts that this will end soon. Once too many parties become involved, WWIII is on the horizon.
Fuck Ukraine  supporters of Israel what goes round comes round
The president of Ukraine should be responsible for the 3rd world war
why would anyone click the like button for a video like this?
BBC showing smartphone footage now?
Freut mich das endlich diese Fusshupe Ukraine aufs Maul bekommt
Funny non of you people sent your hearts out to Iraq when the U.S and U.K carpet bombed their cities killing 1000s upon 1000s !!!
Jesus wept.
Better have a war to stop people talking about Corona and finding out it was not that big a deal and now you're all full of dodgy gene therapy contamination and you've been conditioned to blindly accept lockdowns. Keep watching here for the latest lies and bollocks from the British Bullshit Corporation, brought to you by Boris Johnson and his lying scum-bag cronies, funny how we don't hear about the government taking away BBC licence payer fees now that they're towing the line of manufacturing consent. Comment to be deleted shortly by admins 🤪👍 loosers.
Also the United States 🇺🇸 and NATO
US provoked Ukrain nd now hiding somewhere..now come nd help these people
America, BBC PROPAGAND!!! 🤮🤑🤮🤑🤮🖕🖕🖕
WTF!?He should b tried as a war criminal ffs!!! He's taking out airports so ppl can't escape now?? That's not right! And y'all just gonna sit there and watch and pilo on useless sanctions!! They're gaining new ground with lots of resources, they don't gve a shit about sanctions!!!
No Russians in US period!!!
Dictator Putin and his stooges are responsible for the blood of civilians
Fuckin russia
But the citizens have nothing to do with all these conflicts please🥺
Where or how are those who know, found and reached, to listen and be heard?By who, with whom?Is Northern Ireland, part of the UK or EU ... or, UK and EU? Does the UK still exist? UK of Britain and Northern Island?Britain: England, Scotland and Wales ... ? Isn't the EU, a bit like the Commonwealth of Australia, with states? Northern Ireland isn't a state in the EU?A different scale again, but, isn't Ukraine in Europe? Isn't the part of Russia that surrounds the Ukraine part of Europe? So, isn't 'it' all happening, in Europe? Between European countries?Who knows the answer (an answer or answers)? How do they know? If the answer applies to the situation, then, it might apply to another situation or at least be available as a possibility to see, how it might or might not apply ... ?
To bad the leaders did not take General Patton's advice in 45
Where is Nato ? Where is USA ?
Putin is the real Nazi he's now claiming to fight! Long live Ukraine!
So…any of us wanna go help the Ukrainian?
This is the result of failed leadership. Look on the bright side Ukraine, no more mean tweets in the USA from a man that would have protected you.
Another war by another lying politician , the people in the Ukraine do not deserve this 😪  Even the Russian people don't want this , Putin needs toppling , Terrible.
PRAY FOR UKRAINE 💛💙🙏🙏🙏
As if the world hadn't already gone through enough with covid, now we have this. Putin is the new Hitler, it is so sad.
How sad for our 
Isnt this a war crime? Killing civilians.
GO VLAD GO !! TAKE YOUR COUNTRY BACK 🤔😊
Accha huya guys 😌🙌🏻
The West did far far worse to Iraq…but that is quickly forgotten
Putin waited till Spring to do this. Troops and equipment move better in warmer weather.
Putin has been itching to flex his muscle for a while. Just hope and pray this doesn't keep escalating to all out warfare. it won't end well
Praying for Peace.
this is the most tragic moment for us Russians to watch how one crazy old man destroys peace on Earth
He is a lier. Satan.
That is what humans do
Solidarity with Ukraine was my 🇺🇦. We are fed up with russian aggression. I hate putin
Can't believe we're seeing a live war from our home Pray to Ukraine
Every person who does sin God made them pay the price on this earth its not after death to pay the wrong deeds Putin will pay his wrong doing May god protect and save Ukrainians 🙏 Praying for peace
Why can't we live in peace. God for sure is a merciful one to spare life's of such leaders who only want to kill and rule.... God please help bring peace and do protect the people of Urban and the govt and also do give some sense and heart to Putin...🙏🙏🙏
How many millions has Boris spent on illegal immigrants this month?  As a Briton, this is more of a priority problem than Ukraine. much as I am sorry for the people who live there.
Lesson learn in Cambodia, Lao, Vietnam, Afghanistan don't expect much with USA and NATO
great, can't wait for the WW3 DLC 😐
Wtf is going on in the world 🌎 😳
He can do what he wants, nobody is going to do anything. I wouldn't be surprised if China doesn't invade Taiwan now because they know the rest of the world will do absolutely NOTHING. The United Nations is one of the most pointless and useless organizations on the planet because they achieve NOTHING. When is somebody going to stand up to these bullies?????
Only US is responsible for ths ...what the hell is he doing with Ukrean...it has been partt of Russia
This is the uk and us, fault. Period. They are playing games with a country to get what they want. Ukraine people will suffer not them.
Oh! Poor Ukraine! Victims of western agenda!
@ 1:50 Ukraine president clearly says Biden. Why did the interpretation not reflect what he said?
Ha Amerika nem vitte volna fegyvereit ukrainába akkor ez nem lenne.
F. Ck u Ukraine! You been killing inesen people 8 years and now time to ricieve it back all you done for this 8 years!!THANKS RUSSIA!!!
What is the cause of the war? 🤔I just go recommended by youtube
Russia offered Ukraine to surrender. But its rulers are prostitutes and serve the usa. You have left us no choice, Lord. Where were you when USA and NATO bombed other countries? They bombed 28 countries in half a century. So stick your tongues up your ass and keep licking the USA. All nationalists will be destroyed or they will go to jail!!! We are Russians and no one will ever defeat us!!!
We are going to get through this shit together! Hold tight! Be safe! 🇵🇱 🇺🇦
Kmt
Russia is now a terrorist attacking civilians. Russia will suffer a severe consequences. Shame on you! Death to Putin and his minions. God have mercy to the civilians.
This has to stop! FUCK RUSSIA!!!
My deepest condolences to my fallen friends… 💐💔
If anyone needs a builder?
Russia defends its self by shelling a school.
It’s begun…the question now is…what is the world going to do?
God bless Russia and it's fight against western aggression
Putin reminds me of the Martians in Mars Attacks 
TAKE RUSSIA DOWN NATO
🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
Ukraine wanna join nato and russia nono like that, i think thats the cause, idk
 @AditPoi  I don't really understand but tq for the information
It's obvious that Ukraine is intentionally taking the blow for the msm, so is Ukraine safekeeping their air defenses in the museum? haha Ukraine has been preparing for this eventuality since Crimea, Donbas, for years!
Only 25% americans supported war in ukraine
I dont think even Putin wanted war. He had said as much. NATO could have just said, 
Putin is dibolicly foolish..If he wants.. leave him a trash pile with no resourses .. let him grow old with the shame of failure...
The NWO and NATO have been gradually surrounding Russia with missile bases breaking many agreements with the USSR and Russia over decades. Putin wants to create a buffer zone to protect his nation. The first victim of any conflict is the Truth.
The ice box man turning on himself again. The European white man is way to aggressive and war mongering
Ukraine should've been a grey zone...this attack is completely unnecessary and planned from within
Now Ukraine is under attack by Russia, what will be the West turns will they help or let Ukraine  be invade by communist
My sayad kang Gago ka! Mga inosenteng sibilyan lang ang napapahamak dahil sa kabaliwan mo!
Putin is drawing in his inner circle.But if it draws in much further he might find he's ends up dangling from it.
Praying for Ukraine from Indian occupied Kashmir 🥲
I thought Biden said he goes toe to toe? Putin didn't dare do this under Trump, that is easy to see now. Biden's disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal gave Putin all the info he needed about Biden's capacity as a leader.
My heart goes out to Ukraine where the hell is NATO??!!
Ukraine is not a nato country that's why it hurts all the more
The only ones suffering are us the people,  while our crooked politicians and foul governments play with our lives as if we belong to them.............Resist these foul politicians before they destroy all of us with their weapons of mass destruction.........
why isnt europe standing up ?you are the supposed modern and developed civilization.
It's sad to see all the us channels spreading this lie online.  This one sided story. hope people can use their own brain to figure it out.
I am deeply concerned about the situation in Ukraine. I request both sides to seek non-violent means in solving disputes in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 68/262. God Bless and Stay Safe Everyone.Adam SolomonMiami,Florida,USA 🇺🇸 ❤️
the antichrist
I’m worried the NWO gonna use this to take down Putin hopefully he knows what he’s doing
 @monty mole  They can’t. They risk total Nuclear War and the annihilation all of life on Earth if they do. He only wants a buffer region between them and Moscow. He doesn’t want to conquer the World 😅
🙏❤️🇺🇦🙏
All it takes is 1 idiot to start WW3, praying for the people of Ukraine
His mindset is like hitlers rn to blame innocent civilian Ukrainians for build up their economy, like the Jews when they were doing economically better. ☮️🌍 🇺🇦 🇷🇺
I respect those who stay and work at a time of destitution. Stay strong and push the oppression back!
Russia Has Right To Protect It Self. How Many Muslim Countries Were Attacked By The Western Country In The Name Of Their Security. Goodluck Russia.
Sad that countries like Ukraine, iraq, Libya, Serbia etc were subjected to such cruelty in recent decades. 3 out of 4 was done by NATO tho
No war please
Wicked world
Ukraine best surrender now before Russia wipes them out.  United States and NATO created this mess now they are hiding.
Sending prayers to ukraine from sierra leone 🇸🇱
God bless  those  all people in  Ukraine
HOW ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO SEND INNOCENT AMERICANS SEND THEIR CHILDREN AND FAMILY FIRST.
This time is the end of Russia and Putin. Romania support Ukraine!
Pls Lord help and protect Ukraine
Glory to Ukraine 🇺🇦  make putin pay for this 🇺🇸
Dear Russia & Ukraine best of luck from Bangladesh. I don’t understand why Ukraine need to join NATO anyway. U cannot fight with the tiger if u r living in his jungle. Oneday u have to admit the tiger can kill u anytime. So, stay healthy bcz game is just begin.
I am so sad and scared for the Ukranian citizens.  My thoughts and prayers are with you, Ukraine.

where have your hearts been for the past 8 years while western backed fourth reich gangs attacked east ukranians? The BBC are a state funded terrorist cartel!
The killing of innocent, Russia claim to fame and what do you expect from someone who beats the crap out of its own people ..
Poor people, I’m devastated by the loss of innocent civilians. Europe’s countries should’ve had their own armies, NATO is garbage and weak.
The west uses Ukraine to wage war on their competitor Russia and here is the noble measure taken by Putin who has the gut to learn from the past!
He shows a military airfield at the beginning with a radar station and says civilian construction)) ahahaha
End of times is near... 🙏💔😓
Fuck Putin is a criminal action against 🇷🇺
Putin lies like a little girl but wants to act so tough!
Adolf Putin
fuck if china mimic putin in asia all hell would be unleash ! im praying for peace for all humanity we never learn from history ! ph
Why don't US and Europe leave Ukraine alone?  why they want him to join EU why they are giving Ukraine ticket for joining NATO.....Russia don't want that its future be endangered by powerful Ukrain .....simple ....Ukrain is a buffer state between Russia & EU and its job is to be neutral otherwise it will crush itself between the major powers.... EU and US are responsible for this war and they have created such conditions which led to this.....
Imagine just doing your homework and the Russia started bombing your town. This is traumatizing even for me who is just behind hte screen in another side of the world.
My heart aches for you all but ik you all will be safe my prayers are with all of Ukrainian people
Let's all change our profile picture to Ukraine's national flag now, to show our support for Ukraine!!
Putin what a DICK, reallyHow can anyone this dishonest is allowed to exist freely boggles me
All Russians should now have all their assets in the west confiscated and given to Ukraine.
This has nothing with Ukraine wanting to join NATO and them being on their border….it already is….The Baltic states
This is so sad the war is on now Russia is trash let's take out the trash
Putin getting uppity also that was a pussy move doing that while everyone was asleep    At night

Let's go Brandon Biden the great baby killer
Ukrainians can fight Russia with super weapons they got from England
War is not a solution beacuse it solve nothing and causing bloodshed, destruction..... let's pray for peace ☮️
1939: Invasion of Poland. Invasion of Finland = WW2.2022: Invasion of Ukraine = WW3?
This is what happens when you have weak leadership like President Biden.
Diplomacy is never the choice of language of an evil sociopath. Please locate him Russian people and put him out...He is crazy.
nato should send in the troops. and their planes and missiles.or nato is a joke. America must fly in their jets and troops. or the ccp will laugh at their weaknesses and attack taiwan
My brother is in Ukraine .pray for his safety and others too.
My best wishes and love to the people of Ukraine, may you and your family be safe and strong, god bless you all.from Vietnam with love ❤️
I wish they'd stop saying these people are ready to

Whats about iraq,Palestine,afghanistan?
May God help us in the blood shed
Are you going to kill others for a man that doesn’t even know you ? Are you going to risk your life for a war that has nothing to do with you or any of us? This war is about the elites agenda they send us to our deaths for what?

Supporting Ukraine, from Albania and Italy 💪 Putin you’re a bast*ard. And you Russian people need to take control of your government now, there are no more excuses and you are responsible as much as Putin for what is happening, so get to protesting and take down your government immediately.
Praying from Croatia. This is heartbreaking 😢🙏🏻
Why the west hate China and Russian muslim country think people
U bull shit BBC never showed what NATO nd US have been doing in Afghanistan, Libia iraq and syrea ...Go to hell
Roman 10:9 THE BIBLE SAYS confess with your mouth the LORD JESUS CHRIST AND BELIEVE WITH YOUR HEART GOD RAISED HIM FROM THE DEAD YOU WILL BE SAVE AND GO THE HEAVEN.AND HEALING IN THIS WORLD.
where are the Nato nations,these nations are responsible for this war.
Putin is on a roll,nobody can stop him.Thought and Prayers
Nonsense.  Saddam put up more of a fight than these people are. The one lady was going to do yoga.
Look everyone ,nobody wants war ,the main fact is Ukraine should talk with Russia but The prime minister said the USA and UK with them this is the reason and week earlier Russia was demolished by Ukraine .
Praying for Ukraine. Good always triumphs over evil
I would honestly order a hit on Putin this is not gonna end well if he isn't stopped now! UN are a joke. NATO are also a joke. Whilst China is eating popcorn.
I am very sorry for the Ukraine people sod sad, This is what US want to see  when your president is their puppet. Wake up now.

That's how protests end in the West as well.
All my life I've been waitin' forI've been prayin' forFor the people to sayThat we don't wanna fight no moreThere'll be no more warAnd our children will playOne Day

What a womanly flower child quote.
This is just horrible. My country Afghanistan went through this from the Russians and US. Prayers go out to all the Ukrainians.
History is proofed how cruel russia has been.
Are we just watching the game of the elite repeat?If your comfortable in your safe nation, have you truly sought the absolute Truth!Without Christ Jesus once for all sacrifice personally for your own sacred freewill soul.Then what have you to save you from hell?Holy Spirit is given with the wisdom to repent for those who obey Where the Holy Spirit's leading will have you do.Pray that you and yours will escape what is coming everyone's way!Amen
Globalist destroyed my great grandfather's statue in my home town in Alabama. You are on your own Europe. The south will not be your war dogs ever again.
Too late they were warned for almost one month People need to wake up from their slumber its not time to sleep and trust in little weak frail old men ,they can't saved themselves how are they going to save anyone?God warned us in The Word what will happen in the end.
self-defense while they are the one on the attack????🤬🤬🤬...prayers for ukranians..
This BBC news is fake 🤣🤣🤣
I don’t know how Putin sleeps at night. This is devastating. 😟
Fukin tards....comon sens out of the window!!!!war is in construct........shit
It is so horrible
He' following Hitler's path.
Young men and innocent people die by a fews the power hunger and war monger politician….
Brandon can take on Putin.   He took care or Corn pop.
* Don't poke the BEAR PUTIN !
i hope a russian rocket goes wrong and explodes in poland so that nato can bomb the shit out of russia
Pure act of Consolidation. This is all about expanding territories and ruling the world under conoly. This could potentially becoming of all the EU's countries 3world war! If they fail to tackle this ASAP they will find themselves on the hands of the Russian soldiers‼️ May god bring us all peace and tranquility!🙏💔
Pls stop propaganda Ukraine attack their own then transfer liability to other parties,this is hypocrisy at its finest like return North Bucovina Moldavia and Prut back to Romania.
I feel so bad for the Ukrainian people... So many innocent people.. My heart goes out to all of them❤️🇺🇦
In wars there are no innocents
https://youtu.be/thADhg3M3yIhttps://youtu.be/thADhg3M3yI🙂https://youtu.be/thADhg3M3yIhttps://youtu.be/thADhg3M3yI
And what does you heart do to such many victims in Donetsk and Lugansk killed by Ukrainian regime? Especially those innocent children?
If you give your heart to Ukraine. How will you be alive?
They wouldn't help u fight if your town was under attack
America probably needs to do a Soleimani on Putin in Moscow in broad daylight. But if the Russians can retaliate then that probably wouldn't happen.
No worries. WW 3 has just started. We may see human extinction in our lifetime.
 @Doctor doom  the civilians that had no control over this are innocents
 @A G Official  shut up
 @Doctor doom  The Wars is a pathetic S***!!!! And Lame!!!!
 @A G Official   there's a G7 meeting of all the US and UK presidents going on right now, they have to do another assassination like they did to the guy (forgot his name) but it's probably the start of WWIII...
 @Doctor doom  l8ĺ0
Slava RUSIJI pozdrav iz Pravoslavne!!! 🇷🇸🇷🇺🇷🇸🇷🇺💪💪
Bbc is Western propaganda tv don't listen to them
What just happened?
2 weeks ago the Ukrainians were like nah im not leaving im going to live my best life. but now look they all running away but want the rest of us to fight for them.
Duterte the most stupid in philippine history
from nepal support for ukraine.
im appauled at the comments.its a sad day when media points this at russia. where were the media when ukraine bombed russia? when russia was taunted by the ukranian piece of shit president?this is 100% on biden andon ukraine. not putin. usa wanted this war. they need the money. hence they pushed ukraine to join nato. by doing so making russia vulnerable because usa could use ukraine as a base. this is not on russia this is on usa and ukraine. im sorry for the ppl of ukraine but this is what happens when u play stupid games. the ppl of ukraine deserve better. this is what happens when u taunt a super power for months. the ukranian government is behind the now suffering of the ppl. im not backing 
Where is coward US and NATO
Just one sided...hope Russia achieve their initial goal...
IT'S NOT MILITARY TARGETS BEING ATTACKED... IT'S THE CIVILIAN POPULATION...WHERE ARE THE U.S AND NATO FORCES
My dad is Ukrainian and I have family there USA is to blame for backing neo Nazi's in Ukraine. Russia had enough bloodshed in Donbass! The regime of Ukraine are shelling there own civilians and blame Russia.
This is very Bad situation 😣😢
After covid now this?? Enough world historic event for this decade please.... why must civilian be kill??
These are leaders ?…..These people are the devil .As it was said before this world is ruled by evil men
What did you expect if you’re bothering the other thugs in the neighborhood?????
geez, what does he even mean with 'de-nazification'? (is 'nazi' still a trigger word in Russia?)
Ukraine Foreign Ministry 
At least they showed and expressed how the Russian people feel about this
Am I the only one wondering why Ukraine never joined NATO?
✌
Another democratic country is going to fall and wealthy EU and NATO countries will drink champagne and lecture other countries on democracy.
I think when someone threatens regional stability and claims to re-ignite a Nuclear programme from the past to threaten a neighbour. It all the wrong way to claim assistance sympathy….that’s ZeLensky for you.!He even demanded $5 billion for the upkeep of his economy from US. But this I believe would be his early retirement on his exit from Leadership . He didn’t really wanna stick around as he boasted Re-Nuke-ing.
It's all fitting in to place now, withdrawl from Afghanistan, Mali etc. If Ukraine itself, is the false flag for Eastern Europe.....
They are hitting airports so that no one  can come in or out to help them it’s gonna be hard unless if other countries land inneighboring countries to come in that way
Putin is absolutely and utterly a deplorable being . If He equates anything to Nazis then he should look at his own depraved reflection . May democracy and freedom prevail against the president of Tyranny.
Man!!  why did you poke the bear? Run jimmy run.
Same like before,using media to raised sympathy...I ddnt see media when USA bombing iraq 🤣
denazify? wtf is he talking about?
it Kiev not Keev
keyboard warriors strike again🤭🤭🤭
This is literally Palestinians everyday life yet no one cares
It is all becouse of expension of EU and NATO in 2014, Moment president Janukovic oposed EU and NATO, USA and Germany did start campain against Russia interest everywhere. Also, they implemented nazi mentality into Ukrainians ppl, teaching them to hate Russians. Now we have what we have. I am against any agression, i am against this operation to, i am fpr peace, talk, diplomacy, freedom, free choise, free world.
Unfortunately Russia are a mighty army weather Ukraine army fight it will be a losing battle. I know it's hard to accept. The strong always beat the weak..
Love when you invade another country and claim “self defense”.
Always be nice to your neighbours don’t let anyone to dictate you that’s whythe Eu and the us did to Ukraine now the Ukraine face the consequences and the Eu and the UsDoesn’t the gut to confront Russia militarily.
We need to help hes not going to stop at ukraine
We are witnessing the brink of WW3 ..... We need to stop letting these leaders pit us against each other. These leaders have their own goals and DO NOTHING BUT CAUSE DIVISION among us.PS : Putin wouldnt have done this shit if Trump were in Power. Trump was crazy and stupid enough to go ballistic, that it scared Putin from doing anything.
No regard for human life,just one man's greed.Senseless evil.God protect all the innocent people.
Fear not...this has all been predetermined.  Someone just put a target on his own back.  I predict a military coup in Russia.  And the end of Putin.  Mark my words.
That's exactly what happen when us and nato forces attack Iraq libiya Vietnam and many more other poor countries but it was in the benefit of us and west so nobody cry coz culprits where more powerful than the victims bbc haha
The same scenario was in Irak, Syria, Libia, Yugoslavia, Kosovo, Bosnia, Avganistan and so on, In all of this Countrys wars and conflicts have been started by forein agents, in order to occupay, sell weapons, occupy economy,.and always ppl have been promesed paradise, democracy, beter life, more money if they go to protest against theyr own govermant,  instead of this, misery has come, sorow, destruction
Fake news BBC.
It seemed,that by Putins left hand was some control panel with a lot of buttons with some labels (possibly names of cities around the world?). Then the little display in the middle..  Could it possibly be the control panel off mass destruction? 🤷
A country apparently flooded with nazis by Putin's description is letting a Black man report news in public from the capitol? Something does not add up ?
Slovaks are with you dear neighbours! Stay strong and safe!
Lol, lots of soldiers about as the camera shows a solider getting on to the train and buggering off.
If Trump was in office this would not be happening. Period.
I live in Canada but I’m Ukrainian this is such a tragic and up hauling.

While the west armies were worried about pronouns and transgender safe spaces ..putin was looking to expand his power Who could of seen this coming ?Now watch china decimate taiwan
One Kiev day like typical day in DPR or LPR
Normal people suffering President is in safe place 💔
Mr Putin why  are You hurting those who are not your enemies. Most of the people who are against you are the arms merchants who gain from the plight of people who are similar to your roots. You've proved your point . now please join the healing process by agreeing to a peace accord with your people. Does it really matter whether they're Russian or Ukrainian to your Loving Saviour and mine He loves us all. Cease hostilities use your power for our loving ABBA FATHER YAHWEH. this is your thankYou to HIM FOR HIS SON YESHUA MESSIAH ISSA MASIH JESUS LOVING SAVIOUR.

Ran from Kabul and now Keive, Biden is more successful than zJimmi Carter in woke ratong

Feel for Ukraine . Ukraine became pawns between the between NATO and Russia. This situation was foretold when US got involved with Ukraine some years ago.
Uncle Joe is nothing more than a deer caught in the Headlights!

Scary times scary times.
Soon ukraine is going to end up like Afghanistan.. Next to get invade Taiwan 🇹🇼
God have mercy
Russia and Serbia, most disgusting countries in the world

ATTENTION U.N...ATTENTION E.U
The 
backup Ukraine now.
KOSOVO,  MACEDONIA,  MOTENEGRO,  BOSNIA  ARE  GREAT SERBIA
NATO  AND  EU  ARE  HITLER'S  YOUTH  AND  WANDERVOGEL'S  RUSSIA  AND  SERBIA  WERE  AND  ARE  FREEDOM   FIGHTERS  UNTIL DESTINY  COMES  FOR  US  ALL
USA  THE  4TH  REICH
BBC fake agenda media showing world all lies shamelessly , Ukraine belongs to USSR it means it belongs to Russia so better surrender . Slavic brother stay together strong , there no place for Anglo-Saxon monsters world peace destroyers NATO , All these wordsmy Ukraine friends explained to me sadly 😭😭
this is lies
🎃Russia is an occupying power
They wont stop there. It's only the beginning. The world is screwed.
Shame on USA and the  West. Biden is a disgrace to the world.
Wow. All too familiar  before with Iraq  , Syria, Afghanistan and the rest of it. The same shit had been said again and again.
Pray for russia they been attacked by the west since 1989 its time to fight back
Denazification?!...I hope some SS-Soldiers will show Putin what real Nazis are...
NATO  AND  EU  ARE  HITLER'S  YOUTH  AND  WANDERVOGEL'S  RUSSIA  AND  SERBIA  WERE  AND  ARE  FREEDOM   FIGHTERS  UNTIL DESTINY  COMES  FOR  US  ALL
This hurts

Blame NATO for not accepting Ukraine's request to join NATO.
Putin clearly suffers from a severe case of Mental Illness.He fits the clinical definition of a Murderous Psychopath and should be treated accordingly.A lack of interpersonal empathy and an inability to feel pity or remorse also characterize psychopathic killers. They do not value human life and do not care about the consequences of their crimes. They are callous, indifferent, and extremely brutal in their interactions with their victims.
Its not only Kremlin war! Its Just wot soviet mentality is. Never stop fighting with West democrati and always saying they start the war coz they are World savior.
So sad man! People are going to die, for what reason? Praying for this country.
If this doesn’t precipitate World War 3, I don’t know what will!
I feel sorry for the Ukrainian people but also the Russian people who have no control over their domineering government.
May Hell follow Putin everywhere with deaths gate at his doorstep. Just like Hitler, Putin will follow in a similiar downfall.

 @Erikyolo_THE BEST  im not russian but these ukrainians i bet are lying to make the EU work for them
 @marching vinci  its probable...
WE NEED TRUMP!!!!
They should stop the war already..we don't want war but peace
BREAKING:Meanwhile heawy battles in Chernobyl exclusion zone.Not joke.
As Armenian, leaving in Germany but holding Russian passport , I regret the fact that this happening. I am so sad for once who experienced the war, that’s not our choice that’s Putin personal decision and we are (Russians citizens ) partly responsible for letting him to drive country ... Unfortunately there is still people who are fall in propaganda and believe , that whats is happing is right and has good intentions , it is just because the war is not near of their house. I hope Putin and all his friends are die¡I am sad for my family in Russia and my relatives in Ukraine :(
your neighbor's leader is evil. May God's will be done.
These comments are coming to fast to be real! 😂
Such heartbreaking news. All the countries are just watching and condemning. The only statement that is ringing in my mind is 
Please pray for them!😭that's the only thing we can do for now! 🙏
Russia knows the rest of the world leaders are weak and feeble minded.
Its the same old ww2 ending, 
THIS INSANITY OF RUSSIAN PRESIDENT MUST BE STOPPED AND PUT INTO RESSOLVE.
Хорошая работа, любовь России из Пакистана
Western nations should learn from this atrocity don't gamble with Democracy. Shame on you USA,EU and UK.
NATO cant do anything.WTH?!!!
Such a sad day. World is full of hatred. No contentment. 🙏
We don’t want no war 🙏🇺🇦💙🇷🇺🙏
This is looking just like Poland on repeat
De-yankeeyisation
Lol u got to know u a pos if your country doesn't agree
If Russia is afraid of a small country who can barely defend itself, than Russia…you got bigger countries you just pissed off. Putin is a pansy
https://youtu.be/thADhg3M3yI
Exactly.. these countries you mentioned have created the list horrific events in our history. And they don’t care about human lives.
Putin is coming for Europe
Why is Belarus not being addressed right now as well?
were is nato ?
The world is in the middle of war. This is frightening
This was his plans all along.. he always had plans to invade and he was trying to provoke a fight.. he's a liar
Honestly bro i hope this happens quick. I alrewdy got my inspiration fr my story i dont need no more
All country's should attack Russia.
Ukraine arrested the opposition leaders. Ukraine arrested the opposition candidate who came in 2nd in the election. Ukraine shutdown three television stations who spoke in opposition to the government. Let’s not act like Russia is the only one arresting protesters. The only difference is the US supported the Ukrainian arrests. Total hypocrisy.
Would this have happened with trump as president food for thought
The operation to liberate Ukraine from the neo-Nazi junta continues.
NATO to blame. Relentless and constant push towards East to Russian Border since 1990 unnecessary.
Ukraine shouldn't have listened to  the western leaders in the first place.
This all because the USA and NATO could not stop their obsession with installing military infrastructure along Russia's borders.
Biden go help
Sanctions won’t work
This is west's fault. U opened Pandora box with Kosovo in 99.
Why Ukrainians wanted independence from USSR? This is the result of that longing.
Only US and UK have the right to invade and occupy other countries, right?
Nuclear war
Putin has promised to cause a nuclear apocalypse if other countries attack Russia.  He said it in a public statement.  That means we all die.
 @BenBenson  he needs to be taken out, that's it.
4:01 BBC, not everyone wearing camo is a soldier……..
Russian attack his own brothers and sisters is pathetic.
Feel bad for the people,as to the politeness! Remember what you have been doing to destroy Ethiopia 🇪🇹.
Now def no trust in Puten, not that anyone can trust any form of government but so so so sad.  Prayers for military, they are someone’s family and all the innocent
Is no one gonna talk about that almost all of the citizens happen to speak English?
What's not being talked about - the fact that large portions of Ukraine are Russian loyalists and want succession from the country . There are many in Ukraine who identify as Russian and not Ukrainian.  Not to say that the innocent who do identify as Ukrainian deserve such but with communism and man's urn for power these power plays are not uncommon . History is on repeat .
One can understand demilitarisation, but what is denazification? This kind of language is scary.
I feel helpless watching this invasion.
The only Natzi is Putin. And if NATO thinks sanctions will work they are fools
Most evil dictators 20221Putin ( Russia)2. Chin xi ( China)3. Kim jong UN (North Korea) 4. Biden ( U.S.A.)5. Prime ministers of Canada and Australia
Putin is such a barbaric leader, He must stop his non sense ego
We should be sending people to defend the free world
PUTIN BECAME WOKE
Nuke the Kremlin
Why would anyone believe a word the BBC says?
Putin = hitler v2.0
Force ukraine from Brazil 🇧🇷🇺🇦
Remember Belgrade
This means russia is not just bluffing dude.... What the mighty NATO going to do? Continue talking shit?
I am painfully sorry for Ukrainian people.
Why are you surprised?  English is taught in schools and reporters choose people with good English to interview.
​ @BenBenson  Because the majority of the people still don't speak English in Russia or Ukraine. At least i can speak for Russia, because i am Russian myself, and i live in Russia, and i speak English, but basically everyone i know in my life - doesn't. I would expect it to be quite the same in Ukraine, but maybe it's different.
Kill Russia!!! Free 🇺🇦🙏🏻
Stop propaganda
This is horribleRead more
Ukraine, what a sad day. Sending prayers to all the people. Stay strong Ukraine 🇺🇦.
Not 'fiction utterly exposed', but lies utterly exposed.  This war criminal needs to be put down.
https://youtu.be/2b4LqJCzPZk the truth
Why is that man sitting in Subway instead of fighting? I thought Ukrainian men said they were going to fight… Yeah, right.
😂 Bye bye Ukraine!... If you threaten with nuclear arms you get what you deserve.
7:34 “In Russia now, protests end like this.”  These days that’s how they end in Canada too.
Biden started this war.
All of a sudden everyone in the comments are politicians, people are not responsible for their government's decisions , praying for this to end soon 🙏.
Oh! Innocent souls!
Putin really is cruel like vampire
Who is the super power Russia or United States of America country?
I'm almost crying for those who can't defend themselves.  :(
WW3 about to be underway China will join up with Russia seeing as they held him up as a poster boy literally 2 weeks ago at the Olympics  the only way I can see de escalation is by boycotting their fuel but seekng as Germanys oil is nearly 70 percent fueled by russia can only see this going down hill and rapidly
Russia will also have pay dearly one day.
Reminds me of what america and britain did in iraq and afghanistan. The chickens have come home to roost

where have your hearts been for the past 8 years while unelected western backed fourth reich gangs attacked east ukranians? The BBC are a state funded terrorist cartel!
If Putin Swallow Ukraine he will swallow More of European countries and he will become emperor again 🧐Then Russia up 🔼  USA and Europe  down ⬇️ ,😑,
 @George Cher  keep dreaming. Now NATO will arm member countries bordering Russia to the teeth and it will be a lot more difficult and costly for Russia.
We (as human race) sucks a lot!it s 2022 and we learned nothing
Hope Ukraine will be safe From India ❤
The only way to save lives, let Putin have it..
AND THE WORLD IS GOING TO DESTRUCT HIS COUNTRY.HIS   RUSSIA MUST BE STOPPED  NO MATTER WHAT.
Zelensky unnecessarily provoked the sleeping lion. A false sense of hope given to him by the West 😥
What a sad world we live in
West had a chance to show strength in 2014 and in 2022  and these jokers missed both
With Russian blitzkrieg tactics they'll be at the Moldovan border by tomorrow morning.
This may just be the spark the world needs to enter a literal movie type human apocalypse  . May god be with us all
Everyone worried about ukraine needs to start worrying what this is gunna do to us. Everything is about to get expensive and we might even get attacked to helping who knows but its about to get bad. Ukraine wants everybody dragged into this which i don't agree with, there not even doing nothing but want everyone else to fight their fight.
Its amazing that the US, NATO and the EU are just watching this slaughter progress without any military response. Putin has already warned them about intervention and they ran away like frightened lambs. They wont dare challenge him.  What a bunch of cowards and weaklings particularly the US. They only give a military response in poor third world countries that they could defeat easily. They wont dare get into fight with Russia. Next would be Poland or Latvia. Putin knows he can do whatever he pleases. Ukraine proves just that.
We have experienced two Wars. Now it's the time of big powers to stop this war immediately through negotiations otherwise will have another war.
🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
Be strong Ukraine ❤
I didn't doubt he would do but I hoped he wouldn't
Whenever i see birds flying like that , i get such a eerie feeling 😐 stay strong Ukraine 🇺🇦 ❤ and god bless your people 🙏
Russia kept telling Ukraine to not join the EU and they weren’t kidding
This is all bidens fault he made America weak and now the Russians are invading
This was exactly days of Feb 2014 that Ukrainian Revolution of Dignity came in full swing.
Why cant usa and Europe attack Russia as a form of reprimand.
https://youtube.com/shorts/eCgMVNeko9g?feature=share
I'm confused where are NATO defense forces?
Why are the bbc so biased  and unbalanced!! Not very good bbc! You should show both sides! And I’m from New Zealand! Tell the truth for a change! Ukrain started all of this with American backing!!!
Where’s NATO? She asked - That speaks it all
Fuck you Russia!!!
Where is NATO?
🇹🇭💞
Putin is plain trouble.
I wonder if USA would be upset if it was the other way around?
Because Trump was a traitor for having dialogue with Putin. It's better to not have dialogue and agitate Putin, then act surprised and angry when Russia acts to remove heavy weaponry on their border.
Imagine, minding your own business, and the Russians blow up your apartment.
I hope the surgical strikes are more accurate then the American and Nato strikes in Afghanistan.Didnt Zelensky overthrow a democratically elected leader a few years back?  This democracy thing basically encompasses every type of governance.
I pray the Lord that the Satan takes Putin to hell soon...and also Biden and other jerks
Russia is the new Nazi!Putin is the new Hitler.After Ukraine,next target possibly former Soviet territory such as Moldova etc.
What does this psychopath want
I wonder why he is calling them nazis! Huh could it be all the American leaders using that excuse even if they break a damn nail! We have got to get honest patriots in office in America and that keeps the world safe!
Chilinsky they want to destroy everything we built !!!!! You mean what the Russian's build and you stole
Naruto series hits very hard after watching this. 😢
BBC TELL THE TRUTH...HOW WOULD YOU FEEL HAVING NATO'S MISSILES BY YOUR DOORSTEP????  EVERY COUNTRY HAS THE RIGHT TO DEFEND THEIR BORDERS...DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO NAPOLEON AND HITLER WHEN THEY WENT TO WAR WITH RUSSIA???
Thank you to all the journalists and correspondents out there right now. From BBC and everywhere else. The world is watching, and you are our eyes  💙 💛
Oh yeah a lefties saying it’s all trumps fault Try again
https://youtu.be/thADhg3M3yI
I'm so disappointed in the west. We had no problem getting involved in so many other small scale local issues that truely werent our business. Now that a world power is invading its neighbors again....a REAL threat to world  peace and certainly an end to the freedom of the poor people of Ukraine....NOW we decide not to get involved. All of western Europe should be ashamed...but thats nothing new. But Great Britain and the USA should be doubly so.  80 years of being the leaders of the free world only to abandon it the first time its truely under threat. I couldnt be more ashamed.
putin the jesus hating christian liar like trump,invades ukraine!
Don't believe this western media report. Hmmmm same scenario.
Where are the US and NATO FORCES...ACT BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE... DON'T WAIT UKRAINE TO FALL
Not a War, just peace keeping operation
These guys are so stupid u are literally helping Russians telling them where the people are this is 2022 everything is on the net the net has made us but the net will also kill us everything that is posted from Ukraine is information for them
Where is UK?
ok this guy needs to be put down imediately . fuck sanctions . he needs to be put down immediately
The second I got to 1:21 I got the scripture up that says 
Air strike airport and civilian residentPutin : this is self defense

Take all these people as refugees in the UK. Thanks!
Everyone's prayers and hearts go out... words aren't helpful in this situation we need people actually doing something about this!!!
Omg
Please stop.... innocent ppl will die.... covid is enough for mankind... sombody HELP....
Question where is the combat footage, if Russia has attacked why I haven't seen news from the Frontline on the border?
Stop being a pussy and fight back.
Praying for Ukraine. Let's hope this will end soon.
What are you talking about this is all bidens fault you lefties moron
In this scenario if he lose his job that mean he dead
https://youtube.com/shorts/eCgMVNeko9g?feature=share
Sure, Like maybe start WW3 ? You realise if other countries intervene it will lead to a much more devastating result
Do something urself then ask people maybe ?
Humanity needs everywhere not only in Ukraine.
дурной глаз Putin
This is very bad. Please maintain peace not war. Live a beautiful Country like Ukraine alone, let them be their own country. #staystrongukraine stop war!!!! 😓😓 this breaks my heart.
Where are the feminist in Ukraine let them go forward and fight for their country, give the women gun let the women protect the men and the children
The amount of pro ukraine bots
It's over for Ukraine.  They can't beat the power of Russia.  This would not have happened if Biden had not received 82 million votes (from who?).  This would not have happened under Trump.
This is absolutely crazy
Wth!
my God, this is our worst fears realized. Putin really did forge ahead with a full-scale invasion. I think many of us believed he would invade but only take off a section of Eastern Ukraine - like he did with Crimea back in 2014 - which is still horrible but this is so much worse. prayers go out to the Ukrainian people
Invading a country saying its for self defense real? Nobody ever will ever attack Rusia, just an old fart who knows his time is near
I believe that poland, and the baltic states are next.rputin once said that he wants to revive the ussr
This is all America and NATO fault never forget this
Putin is the most blatant liar since Trump. They are both cut from the same cloth.
need to go to war against russia
Some of the few freedom fighters left respect from nEireann fuck occupation
Sanctions need to be heightened and accelerated.  Russia must be crippled.
Nato and specially usa must take actions fast or it will loose all its respect
Okay where is NATO and US? Good question :)
We are under the same roof.
damn WW3 is about to start
Says the dirty lefties
What do you mean where are they? The created all this mess.
I'm from Indonesia and I feel sorry for the Ukrainian people, I hope the Ukrainian people are okay
Nuclear war
HaHaHa He says is scared of Ukraine  and the threat they pose??? You got to be kidding! They will run thru the Ukraine easier than the US ran thru Kuwait to push out Saddam. Hopefully we study the methods and means he uses to do this and learn his tactics and capabilities and perhaps weaknesses.
And last NATO
If it is unverified footage why use it?
Putin trying to be fuhrer your 1939 playbook isn't fooling anyone
This crazy little devil. He must have urine in the brain or something, cos he has gone totally mad
Russian ho chu ooo
This is it boys o7
Yes correct , just kill the ordinary citizens of Ukraine by your (Russia) military operations.
Good job Putin
Once again the Sith shall rule the galaxy! HEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHE
it shows that usa has not monopolied and patented war.
I don't know the politics of Russia and Ukraine but I know what the Ukrainians will be going through. Prayer from Nagaland India.
My heart goes out to the innocent people of Ukraine 🇺🇦 the biggest warmongers are the 5 security councils since the second World War the five security councils have physically or indirectly fought wars or supplied arms to country's to fight within or neighbouring countries the United nations is a joke
5:05 I'm from Latvia and we are with you guys because we know we are next, we fight for our Mothers/Sisters/GrandMothers, we wont let history repeat itself it's 2022, but I'm ready for deadly war.
Why is it only the same photo/video been shown on all media…. Few explosions? Everyone have a smartphone with great camera… is it because there have actually only been a few explosions? I am not a conspiracy lunatic, just find it odd!

Hopefully Russia destroys NATO. That’s a criminal organization.
I am Russian and I say that it is dreadful shame for all Russians that we couldn't stop this war criminal named vladimir putin. It is evident that Russian government does not deserve to be forgiven. But I want to say the next words as a citizen of Russia - let God make this war end as soon as possible and forgive Russian people who have allowed this war to occur. Peace to the whole world!
Don’t put the forest out. Evacuate everyone.
Ukraine need to surrender and demilitarise before innocent people get killed
Repent, Jesus is coming soon.If you will not raised in the first resurrection you will have another chance but you must die as a witness of Jesus Christ without bowing down to the Antichrist.And if not, be prepared to bear the wrath of God...
Poor Ukraine, where is your army?
And Ukraine and Cuba and heiti and domican republic follows
Most of yonge generation on the western countrys  baseed on movies and  games  that whay Putin  make his on decysion   and he know west is  week and chicken from toop to down
I think it's reaction to rejection of legitimate demand of sequrity gurenty to Russia which demanded from Many years. They felt western countries want to kill Russia and encircled Russia by NATO come to their door step.. so I think they decided enough is enough do now or die early not later.
Time to take them out of the world 🌎 be a better place afterward anyway it goes
Prayers for the people of Ukraine and Russia  🙏 May they resolve their conflict peacefully.
praying for ukraine 🇺🇦
2 CHRONICLES 20:15 Don't be afraid or Discouraged. Of the might army. The battle is not Yours is For God.. Stay in prayers and cry for God. He will heal urkraine. Land from evil one
The Russians have been building up their forces since 2014. What did NATO and the rest of the world think, that the Russians will quietly walk away ? In my opinion there was too much delay by NATO and the unbacked words of support for Ukraine were fuel to Putin to launch an aggressive attack. What the Russians have to do is take over 70 % of Ukraine and keep a buffer zone between NATO and Russia. The sanctions on Russia must have been calculated by the Russians before the attack and some counter measures must have been taken. The real question is, by capturing Ukraine will Russia benefit and if yes then at what cost ? Unfortunately there are companies which make billions of dollars when nations go to war with each other. These companies benefit while nations lose their soldiers and civilians plus incur great financial loss. Most wars can be prevented at an early stage. Let's hope that this war can be ended quickly without much loss. Blessed are the peace makers.
Those 3 Russian protesters are brave, probably sharing the sentiment of most, but they can't speak up, Putin will get a new N.K.V.D to take em to a gulag before long
Soviet Union is back
Well played US, well played Nato.
All my life I've been waitin' forI've been prayin' forFor the people to sayThat we don't wanna fight no moreThere'll be no more warAnd our children will playOne day, one day, one day, ohOne day, one day, one day, oh
So sad my heart goes out to Ukrainian people sending many prayers🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏and❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️from 🇬🇧uk
Putin.... a thug of the highest stature, yet possesses more of a strategic outlook and rat-cunning than his western, highly compromised counterparts.   The west is weak.... China knows it, Russia knows it.
Attacks seem to be coordinated on key areas where US Bioweapon labs are present. Russia seems to be threatened by American weapons off its borders. That’s probably why they didn’t want Ukraine joining NATO because they knew the US would install weapons systems right off its border. Dark days ahead it would seem... the people of the world don’t deserve the crap their leaders roll onto them. This is less of a Nation on Nation issue as much as it’s a Leader on Citizen issue
Ukraine wants to join NATO, and Russia cannot allow NATO weapons to be transported to the Russian border.The president of Ukraine does not allow Russians in Ukraine to speak Russian language...Although he grew up speaking Russian.😓
 @C Peace However, Russia has already have borders with NATO countries (Baltic region), I am sure that NATO is not a threat to Russian sovereignty. As for russian language I can say that whether you come Ukraine you may speek russian free. It's not a problem at all. If we look back in history at our roots. Russians and Ukrainians practically (but not completely) the same nations. Of course, I don't declare that these nations are similar but these are not shallow and artificial signs. A lot of people who live in Russia have nearest and dearest in Ukraine. My grandparents are from Белая Церковь (White Church), this is a town in south from Kiev. So, my thought is that our ethnos, nations, cultures, traditions, customs, economics and languages are bond and mixed together.Nevertheless, I claim that Ukraine as an independent country has the right to join any alliance, body they want. Russia must not distract, bother and, of course, lead a war if it has another opinion.I don't know where are you from, but all in all, I recommend you not to watch any russian  channels. Unfortunately, since 2020 so many independent channels and broadcasting shows have been closed and prohibited. Nevertheless, educated Russians who have head on their shoulders (clear mind, bright head) and a desire to know the truth still can find it in YouTube or from some bloggers in the Internet, for instance Dozhd, Khodorkovsky, Navalny, Varlamov, Katz, Radio Liberty, Current time channels.P. S. I hope that my answer and English  are clear to you.

Putin and the Russian military will never be forgiven for this
They watch how Israel demolished Palestine, and now the world watches as Russia demolishes Ukraine. ??????? Such insanity.

So Ukraine didn’t even try to block the roads or anything.. I could think of so many ways
I just can’t believe it can I not just get on with my own life
Prayers for all

MR PUTIN YOU ARE NUTS 👎
Россия не трогает мирное население
Мне сейчас показалось или  BBC вырезла о словах Путина об том, что жители Донбасса на протяжении 8 лет жили в страхе?
Already driving in the streets, so Ukraine doesn't have a military to fight back or they just do nothing?
That's why women have to be leaders and not men . Because men love blood.

This is the fault of civilians who`ve been praising Putin for a decade now.Everyone with half a knowledge knew all  along what a scummy dictator he has been.   Now these fans of Putin gave him the confidence to go ahead with his agenda.   Russians must stop Putin, or else the rest of the world will forever hate Russians
?
You know that Ukrain, White Russia and more countries acually belong to Russia
FULL OF SHIT COMRADE
Where's the United Nations? Please take action because this is disrupting world peace you 
Why can't Ukraine also bomb Moscow and even the bloody Kremlin itself?Why are they afraid?This is a fight to the death.Why can't Ukraine retaliate and they sitting down to be bombed?There are several Russian cities to be bombed. What are the Ukrainians waiting for?
I honestly thought he wouldn’t invade. Boy was I wrong. I hope Ukrainians are ready to defend themselves, god be with them.
The U.N. terrorists nazis need to leave the Russian people alone war is never good but freedom is not free
😪😔😔😔😔🤲
Yeh and now imagine american tank colony coming to easter europe, 1000of them total
Humans are worst than animals
So it begins .
Sad the way he said he is willing to die for his country. He should have said he is willing to make them die for theirs.
SEND A HITMAN TO PUTIN TAKE HIM DOWN
This bringing tears to my eyes.why is this happening? Why can’t we all live in peace?😢😢
I have said this before that Putin is a Sociopath. With no concern for human  lives and not to be trusted. It's so weird he has the looks of an evil villain. My God , my God  please help these people of Ukraine!
I can't believe Putin would do this. but he did.  amazing.

Karlin sin zelenski  Going to join comedy club in London soon
Fuck russia!
Ukraine please surrender...think of your people now later think of freedom. Russian troops are big. Consider your own peoples emotion
Russia has the right to protect its existence against the nato. 🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
Ukrain is the small kid in school and Russia is the big boy, would you try ti fight the big boy?
Our governments won't let us
Stop crying you baby peace won’t happen now we will either die or we will live
Greed
How naive can you be..?
The Russians won’t let us
Because of USA
https://youtube.com/shorts/eCgMVNeko9g?feature=share
This is already said in the Bible Matthew 24:1...)That's why .So now we have to ready for the coming again Jesus Christ 🙏🙏... let's us do that 🙏
Ukraine president is actual garbage didn't sign peace treaties, bombs rebels, and then complains when Russia attacks. Of course...
All cuz of usa and nato
Its just not how it is.We will never stop fighting. 😢
100% right ✅️
Because you can't control people with peace, with fear you can.
HeLL walker Oh yeah because it’s Nato invading Ukraine right now, right? Idiot
We never lived in peace. 😥
Cause we're stupid
It's so odd seeing the Russian propaganda accounts and comments. So obvious. Either that or they're children
Because war = money for elites. Brandon has been pushing this war.
 @Meriwether  About as unkind and compassionless are you can be with such a comment.
 @Oxy Gen  Nice attitude.
 @Jack Cooke  why thank you
 @McPepsiTwistKing  huh im an idiot? Didn't Putin call the us and nato members to negotiate dozens of time? But they keep refusing his demands....
Because It's a capitalist world we live in?
 @That Guy  After Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances failed by Russians 2014
 @Tyngshain kupar k shabong K shabong   did he come after WW2 Putin us using Hitler's tactics so just saying
 @Darth Wodke  if you are a Christian bro read the Bible in Matthew 24;1...) it's already said everything 🙏
 @Tyngshain kupar k shabong K shabong  I read it and how many times in history has there been pestilence,famine,war this is not different
 @Darth Wodke  Matthew 24;7.says it is just the beginning of sorrows
This is helpful thank you
Got any sources?
Thank you for this
So lots of money for Russia
Praying for innocent people killed by NATO in Libya, Syria,Iraq, Palestine, Afghanistan, Vietnam, Sudan, Somalia and many more..
*1st largest by size. Russia is not a European country. Russia a poverty-stricken and doomed Asian wasteland that will never economically recover from this.
Then why won't NATO accept them in as members?
Why they military so weak. They should be bombing them back tf
I've Google the first few and they don't match with Wikipedia I know it's the most reliable source but I think there's bit of exaggeration here
You forgot about genocide it's committing against the Russia ppl who live in Ukraine
Source: trust me bro
Wow
GOD, dont let russia to conquer this beutiful and powerful country❤❤😊👏👏🙏
If that's the Case then i guess we need to support Russia to destroy the Regional Hegemony of the Fascist USA regime and its Pet dogs NATO.
Just how long did this take to write
Ukraine will lose its independence if it joins NATO. If Canada allied with Russia, the US invaded this country on the same day.
All built by Russia and Russians trough the centuries of Tzarist Russia and Soviet Union. Most of the industry is in the East next to Russia...... You wanted to give all that to the US and her big businesses and same time having Nato/US boots and missiles pointed to Moscow. Well your bravado and your Puppet Master arrogance lead you to this. Enjoy
So now people need reason as to why it matters shows how much selfish they have become .
 @Rv  https://oec.world/en/profile/country/ukr I think this is his source
 @The Bigo Chronicles  they had the third largest reserves of Nuclear missiles
Yes I read up on Ukraines natural resources  they are loaded, I knew something was up it’s always the resources smh
 @Danish Ghani  IM NOT
Thanks for providing such a piece of information
Sadly, this probably is motivation for some but in my eyes there is no need to give the Russians a shopping list, just one reason will do 
See, here's someone that's done the research and actually gives straight facts. FINALLY! 👍🏻👌🏻All I have to add is, prayers 🙏🏻 for all citizens involved💔
 @Dee  NATO wants to accept Ukraine but Russia doesn’t want that as NATO can put military equipment and nukes which are easily in range of an attack to Moscow and launching a surprise attack.
 @Mickey Pigknuckles  Lol, that’s true.
Yeah ok🙄
Every country matters. There will always be innocent people getting killed for no reason when such things happen.
Even with that it doesn't seem to strengthen the claim that Ukraine matters.
So the same reason afghanistan and iraq was invaded then
 @Dee  Russia/Putin wouldn't let them.
 @Dee  They do, it’s just that it’s a process to get into NATO, Ukraine are an aspiring member of NATO. However, Russia doesn’t want Ukraine to be in NATO.
 @unknown  idiot stop liyng .... why dont you critize the realy genode in xinjiang and tibet
 @Rv  What Led to this Moment?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJbSJqZoTIg
 @Mark Casila  the only genocide we saw was in Afghanistan ,Iraq and Syria by the terrorist NATO and American military.
 @Dee  NATO didn't too show Putin they weren't trying to threaten Russia. But Putin wants the old Soviet union back.
Wow you have alot of knowledge. Also its a entry into the southern oceans for Russia. They would want naval control of that area. The opposite is Ukraine joining NATO than them having that cpmtrol
LORD PLEASE PROTECT UKRAINE 💙💛
 @The Bigo Chronicles  and escalate to war. No they must defend themselves and attack only if there is no choice they mostly have the Russian people's sympathy it's the Russian government doing this.
Don't worry!! you don't need to prove that Ukraine is very important in terms sources of the world. Ukraine is important because the people in it are innocent and independent.
 @Rv  trust him bro
If Ukraine government really had the intention of being 
Well said. Everyone should know this.
 @Mickey Pigknuckles  are you implying that Asia ia a wasteland?
Ukraine matters because of its wonderful, good people who have done nothing to deserve this.
Half of this information is false. Iron ore reserves? Aus = no.1 brazil = no.2 Nice misinformation
 @Danish Ghani  Right... Because Russia hasn't been involved in any of those conflicts have they. The vast majority of civilian bombings in Syria were carried out by Russia
 @No Name  NATO doesn't even want Ukraine in NATO! what are you talking about? What's the process for them to join if you can explain?
The most corrupt government in bed with the clintons and Biden.
That's why Nato want Ukraine join to the them..That's why Russia is worried that its country is threatened and is being watched by the Natos from the Ukraine region, that's why this war took place.  the speech of the president of ukraine only wanted to seek the sympathy of the world community.  even though he should have thought about it if there was a war and he should have thought more about civil people.. I am very sad for the victims of civil society, pray for civilization
If so ww3 will happen because no-one will give up ukraine
 @unknown  Firstly, I'm going to need sources on that. Secondly, I wonder why those Russians are in Ukraine?.. Could it be anything to do with the genocide Russia committed on Ukrainians in the Holodomor?
 @Dom Pyatt  Where's the surprise?
 @Dom Pyatt  Where's the surprise?
it also was also part of historical russia
 @Bivamshu Khadka  No? I said Russia is an Asian wasteland. That means that Russia is a wasteland that is located in Asia. Stop trying to start shit.
 @The Bigo Chronicles  Reason is simple, they gave up their Nukes back i 1990s for the promise from US, UK and Russia for protection. And right up until 2014 they did not even though of Russia as aggressors (they called them brothers). From then on, they were in constant battle in Donbass and Luhansk little by little depleting their firepower. Dont get me wrong - Ukrainian guys are strong, back in 2014 they were literally battling with 1 to 30 efficiency. But they are basically battling zerg armies.
The most corrupted people says Donald Trump !Ukraine economy is not worst than Turkey ! If Russia block the sea, there will be no export.  That is what you pay for putting  tactical US nukes near Russian border and killing Russian Ukrainian in Donbas. Don't act innocent !
 @Claudio Pereira  Wrong. The agriculture in Ukraine is all in the West. And who those resources go to is besides the point. If Ukraine chose to join NATO that would be their choice and only their choice to make. It's incomparable to a militarised ground invasion
 @Zarrar 9  fascist USA? Putin is an ethnonationalist autocrat, who wages were to 
 @unknown  you mean genocide being committed by Putin? Because there were no issues with Russians historically ever until 2014 invasion.
Only problem is they never took steps to be independent. It was still a part of russian territory according to a treaty. It’s not even talked about in the media coverage. No Ukrainians waving flags wanting independence. No it’s Russia Russia Russia Putin Putin Putin. The invasion is still wrong sure but if you’re going to play the independence card I want to see proof of it.
Look at all the Putin bots in this comment section
 @Mickey Pigknuckles  that is also entirely capable of causing severe military and technological damage to the west. Call it all the names you like it doesn't change facts.
 @Zarrar 9  unfortunately Russia is also fascist so..
Military intervention is needed NOWPutin MUST be stoppedThe guy is INSANE
They matter because they're human beings. They matter because they've had the sense to protect their government from the enemies, not giving power to the NWO. Most countries have already been infiltrated and power within our lands secured. Ukraine was a threat because they're not down with the Satanists that think they've got all the power. We haven't even gotten started. They've already lost. They're on a rampage because they know where they're headed. The end is near. You're watching psychopaths having toddler sized temper tantrums. The misery that inundates their eternal future goes on for eternity, like a broken record. They'll get the mercy and consideration they deserve. The same mercy and consideration they couldn't afford. Encroaching on our right to choose. Ya that's going to be a serious issue for them. For each 1%er you have millions of people losing their right to earn an honest living, as they pocket the fruits of someone else's hard work. So they can afford to kill so many innocent civilians with just one blast. Psychopaths..
 @Tope  That's besides the point. If Ukraine joined NATO it would be their choice. Ukraine arent asking Russia to invade them
 @Jaded Witness  I never said Russia wasn’t a threat. I said that Russia will never economically recover from taking these actions.
 @Jaded Witness  but would love to see the European Nations getting destroyed and feeling the Same pain the people of Middle east felt.
 @John Shaw  Putin must also bomb England and France.
Ukraine don't have resources that Russia... and Russia is not there because of their resources... Those who are there for Ukraine resources you know them and I don't have to tell you... 👍🏾
All these things they have, how have they not invested them to their military personnel, sumn ain't right🙂💔
 @John Shaw  that's not happening. Russia isn't Afghanistan or Iraq that the US can just go in and bomb indiscriminately without consequence. It will be bloody and nothing short of World War 3.
 @George Washington  Pretty sure NATO wouldn’t turn down the chance to be further on Russias doorstep. Basically Ukraine needed to complete Members Action Plan but it fell through as the the old prime minister didn’t want to be in NATO so they never because a full member they are just a aspiring member. The process really is just about politics, economy and military contribution. But I guess you could say that Russia not wanting Ukraine to join NATO might prevent NATO from accepting.
 @Danish Ghani  and Yugoslavia...
 @No Name  The deal was about cleaning up CORRUPTION in Ukraine which still persist in Ukraine. If you were paying attention Selensky just two or so day's ago was just asking NATO what's the hold up, and pleading for expeditious action. They are never going to allow Ukraine as a NATO member that's laughable, however the CIA and US military assets, and personnel have been covertly in Ukraine for many years unbeknownst to most people so weapons have been poised to attack Moscow for some time, and this is the epicenter of Putin's concern. Naval bases in Crimea is another major ambition for the U.S. in particular via NATO.
Thanks bro! Underrated comment
 @No One  but Russia doesn't want ukraine to be a place for nato to place their missile and nuclear weapons so they can attack russia quickly and easily .. do we care more about people far away and we don't know well than our own neighbors??
 @Dom Pyatt  Ukraine is doomed unfortunately. NATO does not want to accept Ukraine as a member because then they'll have to actually get involved, leaving Putin will free reign to do whatever he wants. They've had nearly a decade to become members if NATO really wanted it and even today they will not accept Ukraine.  NATO will not get involved at all. They'll rely on attacking Russia with sanctions and that's as far as their involvement goes.
Fuck USA
What's the goal with this propaganda
when you have a weakling in the whitehouse,  and a gangster on the prowl, with his ccp gangsters supporting him in the neo axis of evil, ukraine will not be the last. the tsar is eyeing poland, lithuania and chech etc.get trump back into the WH, and eu an nato are led by a spineless morons.hmm taiwan?putin knows these are weaklings, he can walk all over them.
Self defense?! Putin is insane! Who is attacking in Russia, not Ukraine, you immoral dictator!!! 🖕
Same style Iraq was attacked by Americans and NATO . Iraq war was without UN approval  . Now Putin following same road
This is a neo-nazi！Fight back,Ukraine!
This reporters are full of shh. Just report the news man
Biden Putin collusion. This happened with Obama's 
Like a Syria Libya Iraq kosovo nothing new don't worry about
Putin loves dog, give him one, I guess it can melt his heart a wee bit
OHHHH SHUT UP, UKRAINE 🇺🇦 WAS ONCE PART OF THE SOVIET UNION,  IN FACT THAT WAS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE SOVIET UNION! WTF R YALL TALKING ABOUT! GET INFORMED IGNORANTS!
God I hate war
The new Hitler ooo noo man's insane
Every one should stop talking to Russia and it’s people who live there. All flights should be stop. All ties cut off from a bully President.
That woman didn't make any sense. If it's terrible to be at war with Ukraine, maybe Russian soldier should not go to fight this war instead Ukrainian soldiers to surrender defending their country?
Russia gonna kick Ukrainian ass!! 💪🇷🇺Wolyn 1940s, Ukraine backed by US tho 😂😂East Ukraine filled with Stepan Bandera supporters 🤢🤮🤮
When Germany attacked The Soviet union in 1941, they achieved rapid successes in the opening theatres only to be bogged down in wars of attrition and forced to the defensive..... history may just repeat itself
Kkkkkkk there is non surprise of the reportage  BBC kkkkkk  Fake News  ...your Government did lie to Ukraine  by Giving Him the Waepon  now He is getting beating by President Putina .Shame on the west ..
Everything is going to be fine Ukrainians be brave our God will fight for you guys.
This world is in such a fucked up place. What's wrong with people.Reading these comments are sad but also a realisation that there are still caring loving people out there.Don't we have enough shit to deal with. God be with all the people.
I can’t see a defence strategy from Ukraine if they just wait for bombs to drop on their city without offence. Basically the Russian just have to unload all their soon to be expired bombs perpetually. They won’t lose a single soldier, but for Ukraine, they have to start counting casualties on a daily basis. What kind of war is this?😰
So you can call it evil........so what. What are we going to do against evil? Evil is showing us the action of evil. So where is our action of good and protection and fight against evil?? Come on, world. Where is your army?
well , war it is I mean we all saw that coming
☮ STOP PUTIN - STOP THE WAR!☮The US and EUROPE and the entire democratic world MUST STOP Putin - immediately DO real, not petty micro-sanctions against Putin and his oligarchs! POLITICS MUST FINALLY DO REAL TOUGH SANCTIONS AGAINST THE PUTIN REGIME! Politicians in the US and EUROPE must stop talking, they must stop the warmonger, confiscate the accounts and assets of all Putin's oligarchs and those who support the war and the takeover of Ukraine! Do it, don't talk! Stop SWIFT for Putin, freeze all the assets of Putin's oligarchs, banks, Gazprom, all Kremlin corporations - the Kremlin's engines of war.Germany must finally stop supporting Putin economically! Obama and Trump just chatted and did not do any serious sanctions! STOP PUTIN - STOP THE WAR!☮
Putin is defending itself. USA nato STAY OUT
and other european countries don't want to be involved lol this just shows potential nato countries that it's not worth trying to join nato because once they angered russia, no one will come to their defence. nato just sealed its fate.
Thank Russia for letting me see something real outside of games.
Where is NATO and their help to  Ukraine people ??

They prayed for peace, not war?  I prayed for my marriage and still got. DIVORCE!D!!!!
I think the west aka nato will not do anything😞, because they know Russia is king of sky.. If was in pacific region US will acts.
Only innocent civilians are dying because of two leader's ego..

Where can I see real news ?
And a lot more will die if the leaders are stupid and don't do anything
https://youtu.be/thADhg3M3yI
I really hope things get better.
it's about time for war, i am bored here i want to see the western world kill themselves. survival of the fittest
From a global pandemic to a possible 3rd world war.
I honestly cannot believe Putin has taken it this far. All of my prayers, wishes, hopes and my heart goes to  Ukraine, and those who are against war in Russia. I hope this situation can be taken into better hands to avoid any escalations. From australia <3
Russia is most hated country in the world 2022#2. China3. North Korea4. Iraq5. Afghanistan6.iran7. Australia8 . Guatamala9. Canada10. United States
War harms the innocents and the peaceful the most, it's absolutely horrific
Wheres the fuckin US lol
87 time ukraine fired after ceaase fuire on russia land scerw you that payback dumm liar
Innocent people and animals will die and suffer because of a mad man 😡 How dare he
We need global.war on putin
The world must help Ukraine against the Russian president
Praying for PEACE ✌🏻🌎🙏
This is what western Ukraine did to eastern Ukraine for years with US support, only they didn’t use precision missiles and killed thousands of civilians with their shelling and air strikes.
And there we have 2022
Indian nationals are now unable to leave Ukraine. I hope wakes up the Indian government to stand on the right side of the conflict.
Its absolutely horrifying that this is still happening to this day. Are these the adults which are supposed to give an example to me and my generation??! Not to mention my future children's generation... Absolutely disgusting. There are already enough issues going on in the world. And now this. I pray that the civilians and their families will all be safe.🙏❤ They're the only ones who I feel sorry for. Putting many people's lives at risk because of these idiotic governments.
Fuck Russia time they pay
I'm just glad Trump isn't in office otherwise it's clear he would be sending USA troops to help Putin . Breaks my heart civilians are in the line of fire . This maybe the start of dark times for us all.
I think it was either this or they attack Russia first after settling their forces in Ukraine 🇺🇦. And with recent history knowledge you don’t want to wait until America is at your doorstep. Sad but it’s almost a defence tactic at this point.
he has to for russia's safety. if ukraine were to engulfed into NATO they would and probably have missiles in Ukrainian soil which is dangerous for russia.
Why was there not so much sympathy and emotion when the Ukrainian army bombed Donetsk and Lugansk for 8 years?
Your country did far worse in Iraq…..but how quickly you forget your crimes
I would bother writing an eloquent, sophisticated, and pointed reply, but your comment reveals you have no idea what the fuck you’re talking about, and thus I’ll just tell you outright; you’re wrong. There’s not a world in which a superpower like Russia would have to worry about much of anything outside of First World Markets, like the USA.
 @waffled  people like you who try to justify Putin’s actions are absolutely horrifying
Putin has been warning nato for along time and they ignored him, now he has called their bluff!!

All I read is “World Leader throws temper tantrum over dick measuring contest; risks thousands of Ukrainian and Russian lives in the process.”
Putin has no choice. Hehehe. Dang excuse
Before replying to any comment just check the profile and comments in it. Might be chinese or russian bot
 @waffled  they are independent they should be able to do literally whatever they want
 @Coluurs  What matters is you provided Putin with plenty of justification to strike.
 @yjk5430  Oh, we’re all dying to know what you’d consider “plenty of justification” to strike at civilian population centers? Enlighten us.
 @Moses Idrees  Yes because I'm sure Nathan here killed innocents in Iraq.
 @Moses Idrees  Whataboutism at its finest
 @Nunya Bidness  All those people were terrorists obviously
 @Nunya Bidness  Russian military is now over-running Ukraine, yet you are clueless about 
Nice non-answer. I’m well versed in this, and doing more research than ever now. I’d be willing to change my mind, if you’d provide any remotely good justification, so I’m certainly not hopeless. I’m just yet to find anything that remotely aligns with what you’re saying from a non-biased source. So, you can continue not providing “hope” “, and I’ll continue learning more, and hopefully one day my children won’t have to live in a world like this, with people like you. I wish the same for your children as well, god help them.
The propaganda machine is almost as dangerous as these bots. For any real people here; I have only one recommendation, regardless of your stance. Read, watch, learn, and absorb as much as possible. Do what you can, when you can, and we will get through this night as brothers and sisters. Evil will not triumph where good men and women stand strong, planted firmly in the rich soils of their varied and beautiful beliefs. Much love for you all, even those I disagree with. Soon, the world will not be the same world we’re having this conversation in. Only history can tell.
 @Дед Мазай  Because Russia manufactured insurrections in those 
 @Matthew O'Neill  If you don't know anything reliably about these events, why are you saying this? You watch the BBC too much. you need a lot more information to reason about it.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utSUDTVVGVI  this is how people stopped the Ukrainian army in 2014. Then they were killed by Ukrainian punishers.
 @Moses Idrees  not rlly it was all America lol.
 @Coluurs  im justifying it because thats the reality of it, it's not like he went into ukraine wanting a blood bath. Now imagine if Mexico or Canada were getting nice and buddy buddy with russia or china would this be the same reaction?
 @waffled  US and UK went in 1stThe other nations came in straight afterIt’s a well documented war
 @Дед Мазай  Your video and comment are incoherent. I think it is you who needs to learn more information.
 @Matthew O'Neill  What don't you understand in the video? there, residents of Donbass, peaceful citizens of Ukraine, are trying not to let the Ukrainian army into their city. For this, they were later bombed from airplanes and heavy artillery.
I think the United States should be at least in the first 3. All these conflicts are created by the US
https://youtu.be/thADhg3M3yIhttps://youtu.be/thADhg3M3yI
Fuck USA stay out of this
They don't need your heart, they need your support. Give money, food, water, ammunition ...
cant help but to feel bad for these innocent people of the UKraine. Puttin said its in self defence, please, nothing but selfish and heartless person he is.
This man even if, he is thinking of the best for his country, is right now in a paranoid war with himself. True leadership does not blame other, he brings solutions and alternatives, this is not what leadership looks like, Biden on the other side is a wimp of a president with his current office, nobody is to blame here but Rusia and America.  This shitshow they call politics leaves only bodies to be picked up behind them. I`m sorry to see this evolve in 2022 were a Pandemic is or was instituted and right now that has not even been spoken of in the last 2 months. Ugly
Cash out in time !
Putin is a psychopathic tyrant, worse than Hitler.WORLD, HELP TO UKRAINE.Russia, aside from receiving world condemnation, must pay all the damages it is causing to Ukraine, which to date, are billions of euros.
And the world just watches what a sham. what threat are they?
The criminal Putin needs to be tried for crimes against Humanity.
My heart goes out to the Americans, instead. Oil passes $100 a barrel, the stock.markets are tanking, inflation goes higher, ..All this just for Ukraine.to be a NATO member....really...
Europe provocated Russia, that’s what you get. Ukrain could have avoided this. Russia is just defending themself so stfu
Of course is working like western predicted, they organize it
i send my love and prays to the people of Ukraine.
The war is what it is. It is not Bahamas Beach.
There is saying that 
Those who support Ukrainian president  go fight for him! Stop being a hypocrite…..
Canada .usa. England.germany.France.And russian poeple WAKE UP...Her ADOLF start like this!! No time for crying....Poutine Will not stop after ukrain is a mad man now!! Is getting old and war before death !!poeple of Ukraine all m'y love and love from m'y family go for you all ukrainiens poeple♥️♥️♥️
Stop.calling this putin a president he runs a fake democracy
That Russia crossed the border into the two contested regions of the Ukraine with military force is undeniable. It's sad that anything other than that fact, everything else has to be thoroughly researched, as I don't trust the BBC, or 'our' media
May Putin Have a swift and decisive VICTORY 🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
American President from  Clinton to Biden as well need to be tried for murders of millions from Latin America to Middle East
 @K K  Well Ben Laden, Saddam Hussein and Hitler already have their justice.   What a Russian Troll account reveal you have there, idiot.
Start shooting missiles at Russia then bring the war to them
People need to leave staying at home means they might be bombed
Can’t they just have like a boxing match putin and like boris
US AND BRITS AFRAID
how it seems to you the idea that Russians and Americans are killing each other and the rest of the world is living happily
We need to GO HELP UKRAINE 🇺🇦FIGHTThis will happen to ALL OF US.
Nice to know that there are so many kind hearted people.but wonder where were all these when USA attacked in afghanistan, iraq, and other countries and killed so many innocent human beings including women, children and neonates.
Prayer of bravery and hope for all of Ukrainian from India
Uuuh. Didn't We just watch putin set this up for weeks?? Couldn't we have like, stopped him?

This is just like Iraq terrible situation, why did Ukraine start shelling Donbass some time ago? that on it's own brought attention from it's neighbours
Hey brits...this is the end of anglo hegemony....sorry but You are destrying Europe with líes and your metanarratives about supremacy
In same manner all terrorist around world preparing for civil war but liberal media is always blind
you are better equipped than the Taliban don't worry, but do your country is united to fight? the outcome of the war will answer that question......
Hey Putin, why are you polluting air, water, soil?
where is USA
Bombing civilians in 
My heart goes to Ukrainan people, Keep strong from Philippines.
This is the re-play of Hitler's polland attack.
Ukraine’s sovereignty ended in 2014 when the US overthrew its democratically elected leader in an illegal coup and installed a puppet gov’tAt least 13,000 people have died in fighting since then in a war fueled by US weapons and neo Nazi militias. This war did not begin tonight

Yes kabayan. Let's pray for them
Ipagpray mo ang lahat wag ka makasarili.
 @Nina  and a 100k thousand more will die in this pointless war.
Peace will never come as long as Ukraine join NATO FORCE .How would USA feel if Russia starts to join forces with USA Neighbours ???I don't understand why USA/NATO had to build defensive forces on Russia Neighbouring Countries .Face the consequence now 🤦
I’m from Japan. It’s really heartbreaking and shocked for me. I pray for Ukrainian. I hope it’s not getting worse any more. I want peace.
https://youtu.be/ik4d-heitrwUkrainian political gangs really lack political wisdom and brains !
Send ships to Ireland I will happily go help Ukraine I'm a good creeper I will only need 1 killing knife 2 bone cutting knifes and 3 hand guns and I will kill manyI was born without feelings so trust me I would show no pity to any Russia army man most won't even see me coming
Go to hell! Putin.
NATO where you at, EU where you at, USA where you at?
NATO endangered Ukraine in the name of membership. Now those countries just busy on show off. #SaveUkrainian #NATO
🇷🇺
We stand with ukrain stop russia putin for blood sheet
Actually USA & NATO pushed them into the war by expanding NATO into Russian border.. and usa also want to cut Russia out of Eu market. so they can sell their gas to EU market
All the people of the world, focus your thoughts on putin having a massive heart attack.
Noooooo war please 🙏
NOW YOU GONNA SEE WHAT IS MEAN POWER SATANS ZIONISTE
Allah is punishing Ukraine for infidelity.
throw everything at russia ,screw putin end his sorry arse! this is just crimes against humanity bombing civilian areas all morning..deplorable!
If all the world smoked a joint we would have peace for eternity. ❤️☮️❤️
Can we just turn Russia into a glass parking lot? This would simplify things so much.
prayers for ukraine
Sleeping joe didn’t do anything,send troops
BBC your agenda is clearly showing... shameful.
I stand with Russia
USA did Japanese people way worse than this..
Not as heartbreaking as compared to the war crime Japan had done to Korea, China, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines 🤣🤣🤣
 @joe strummer  He's a citizen of japan not general you douchebag.
 @Claudia Claudia  You do know we ourselves didn't just decide to drop the atomic bomb right? It's was a joint decision?
Even if it happened he has people setup to take over and keep his regime in place
 @LexPew  Focus on them all as well.
Russia isn't a Muslim country
Whata piece of shit. Only point is to take back a country that has been doing well without russia
Please don’t destroy this beautiful city Ukraine is beautiful Peace for Ukraine
🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩⚔️⚔️💪💪💪💪💪
what's worrying is if china moves against taiwan seeing the lack of resolve from the rest of europe and a weak US president... then we're on our way to WW3...
Ukraine has nukes, use them.  they cant beat RU with manpower, RU has nearly triple what they do. But they can go out on their own terms. If my peoples way of life is going to end, im gonna punish those who are ending it.  Im petty i know.
Let’s just say it’s the beginning of ww3

The main stream media and its Trillionaire owners planning on murdering Christian’s again. When are we going to wake up and stop these super wealthy make us murder each other while they’re in theirs bunkers with our gold?
Blood everywhere🤔🤔One day it will be putin bleeding
Retaliate AZOV BATALLION !
I dont understand what is the problem btn these two nations someone explain pls
Pray for Ukraine.. 🇧🇩
Face of Putin innocent but inside full of darkness!
There is already fighting on the streets of Kyiv, Russian paratroopers landed everywhere.
People suffer and die that’s what really hurt
This really must stop. It seems that this has been orchestrated by outside forces ie {New World Order}
Criminal : (
De-nazification? Really? You attacked an airport not a military one..
GOD HELP THEM. MAY THEIR SOULS NOT PERSIH. AMEN🙏✝️
Nice i new all this from nato was bullshit
https://youtube.com/shorts/eCgMVNeko9g?feature=sharehttps://youtube.com/shorts/eCgMVNeko9g?feature=share
Letting America build military bases in Ukraine is why this is happening. Good luck lmao
 @D star Boi  dude fck off already, no one cares about your useless input
 @D star Boi  yeah, Russia has a military base with long range missiles in Kaliningrad in the middle of EU.... And you think that is fair? You can't have it  both ways buddy.
 @SpiritDragoness  Kaliningrad is a Russian city you fuckin moron lmao. They’re allowed to have whatever they want on their own soil. The point is America is 7000 miles away and still building bases all over EU. You guys are so DUMB you’re being invaded by America slowly. Inviting them in 😂
I had to stay up all night on a big school project and I constantly have been checking the news. Watching this situation break down so quickly has been insane.  Hoping the best for Ukraine, Putin has lost his marbles.
People hiding down in the subway train basements.I've never seen that movie before ??OH, wait Britian 
Not one person was spotted crying.    Shouldnt they be sad?
I stand with Russia
Russian bot and trolls have their hands full today.
Russia feeling threat from Ukraine 😂 man Russia has 3x the area of Ukraine
My heart break down sorry civilians of ukrain long live you people ❣️May lord Shiva give you enough strength to come over ..😭😭😭😭
Who's in line to profit from this catastrophe?
Fake news bring good news finally
This because of both USA & Russia
I am so annoyed that we let it get this far, we should have recognised this in the west and stop aiming for ukrains nato membership. we pushed russia into a corner, and it's more important now than ever that people realise that we knew a conflict was going to happen over ukrain.yet still we continued forward. YES russia is at faul here but, we need to realize that this isn't entirely unprovoked.
God bless, Russia!
Not every country is soft and left leaning like you snowflakes are used to. Putin is a true alpha male and he repeatedly said what he wanted and all the weak countries said he wouldn't take it and he now is! This isn't surprising at all.
Nothings going to happen this is just fear mongering
What do the world want , does Russia want money from Ukrian , or what amd how much does Puttin want , cant it be paid in installments inteady of buying with humans blood
NATO will just give sympathy lol! Russia will not tolerate Ukraine to be part of NATO. They will use nukes on Europe if need be!
This could have a very severe ripple effect...
Да Здравствует РОССИЯ!!!
@1:47 eye roll.  And in another sentence you say how powerful you are.
Its only up to you to defend yourself, men and women need to fight for their county the us wont be coming to save you and its up to Europe to fight its battles.  Sorry and good luck

Shiva is a false God.Only Jesus is the truth 🙏🙌
 @Green Scenery  this is why there's War
 @Sao Ham  yes there is war because people worship evil.
 @Green Scenery  who decided what's evil what's not
 @Sao Ham  God
 @Green Scenery  so you are appointed by him to judge people
 @Sao Ham  when people are living in falsehood. It's our duty to guide them to the right path.Jesus Said
 @Green Scenery  WHO give you that power who elected you You have no power over anybody chill out and poop 💩
How can you possibly say that when people are being killed... unbelievable
 @Cubejam  you believe bbcits your choice
 @Cubejam  say that about nuremberg too, dont be a hypocryte like your bbc
 @qb  absolute fool. You're honestly unbelievable.
This is so scary. Hearts and prayers where needed. I don’t even know what to think anymore.
Yeah, Brandon really has Putin shaking in his boots, alright.
Stand strong Ukraine.
Throw every Russian diplomat out of USA and Europe. Eject all embassy Russian staff and families. Consider pulling visa and throwing out all Russians in general from USA and Europe population including students and business people. Ban all tourist travel to Russia...or one way tickets only. No return. Close Europe and USA airspace to all Russian planes. Putin has planned this invasion for a long time. He will live with it for the rest of his life.
Reminds me of how America and England butchered millions in the Middle East
Stop bullying Ukraine!
To get a real picture view both side propaganda channels, and then apply some iq. Don’t let one side propagandists pollute your mind.My conclusion: US and NATO took Ukraine for a ride, propping it up against Russia and then left it hanging naked & wet.
Please my lord Jesus christ come and help ur people of Ukraine against the Evil man pultin.. Judge.. As you did it Saul.. When he was on King David.. Bornagain Christian pray. Jesus christ is coming back soon.. Matthew 24 :6-8.. Pray
Go to war with Russia nato and america
You'll take my life, but I'll take yours tooYou'll fire your musket, but I'll run you throughSo when you're waiting for the next attackYou'd better stand, there's no turning backThe bugle sounds, the charge beginsBut on this battlefield, no one winsThe smell of acrid smoke and horses' breathAs I plunge on into certain deathThe horse, he sweats with fear, we break to runThe mighty roar of the Russian gunsAnd as we race towards the human wallThe screams of pain as my comrades fallWe hurdle bodies that lay on the groundAnd the Russians fire another roundWe get so near, yet so far awayWe won't live to fight another dayWe get so close, near enough to fightWhen a Russian gets me in his sightsHe pulls the trigger and I feel the blowA burst of rounds take my horse belowAnd as I lay there gazing at the skyMy body's numb and my throat is dryAnd as I lay forgotten and aloneWithout a tear, I draw my parting groan.Iron Maiden
Why are we humans like this? So much death. I'm so sorry Ukraine.
De nazify hes the only nazi here scumbag
If this is world War 3.I petition to all leaders just to have a FK cage match...Or royal ramble at the cage..Not like this idiot..
How can you show presidents talk mute them  and say all different thing ….. that’s  not what any ow them saying….
Putin most be stopped at any cost, he attacks and kills civilans without regrets.
I’m not buying it
Their metro looks cleaner than US 🤣
BBC reporters interviewed the peasants
I felt pity for that. My heart goes to the people as others said. From the Philippines
What really sucks is that the normal everyday people on Both sides who had Nothing to do with this now have to go through  this. If the people of power have beef they should be fighting in a designated area.  Not chaos like this.
This is just low. He's not even targeting military personnel. Just straight up places with lots of civilians.
I have to admit I didn't think Putin was actually going to do it. It is such a pointless war. Putin's coolness has faded completely. He just seem like a silly dictator
🇷🇺❤️🇮🇳❤️🇺🇦
Putin has lost his mind! It won't end well for him!
What west did at Libya, Iraq was much worse. You have ruined the world peace

We as humans have! to do better than this. Forget Mars we need to learn to live peacefully together as One world 🌎
Wait until russias Old rusty Machines get destroyed by EU and America
We are Ukraine 🇺🇦 #putinmustfall
why usa is not responding to this madness. what is the purpose of being so powerful if they cannot help.
Give it to him and will no be wear . You both speak same language .
We are all looking at and listening to = SATAN Himself ! ! !
just give up you will die,Putin so called luvs his country but hes killing his own people hes a modern day stalin,Hitler,Russians should turn there back on him hes a scumbag.
Now let’s see how long it will take for the canal channels to open.
Isn't Putin a Christian or a religious person, people who live in Ukraine share the same religious beliefs as do Putin
The West has some neck talking about 
Putin is that guy that fears military force by the Ukraine and in the same breath threatens the world with his arsenal of nuclear weapons.The free world stands with Ukraine!
I think everything Democratic should be destroyed all the Democratic cities in the United States are s*** holes
Lol civilian buildings don't have giant radar installations on the rooftops.  This channel is dishonest.
Support ukraine...eliminate putin animalistic decision..

#FuckPutin
wow those few russian thats doing a peaceful protest got arrested i guess go to gulag just like chinese slave camp for protesting
Make Kyiv the next Stalingrad and Afghanistan. The Ukraine people fighting as an insurgency is the only hope you have to defeat the ruskies.
Stay strong Ukraine
Goddamn
Добро пожаловать в новый мировой порядок.
First, stop all flights into and out of Russia.  Isolate the Russian population.  I know that there are many who are against Putin in Russia but the only way to sting Putin is to make his populace suffer.  No trips for the Oligarch's girlfriends to Paris Fashion week.  No new Benz.  No vacation to the Maldives or Thailand.  No Harvard education for the Oligarch's children.  Etc, etc.
Putin is probably not got much life years left and is now thinking fuck it lets start a war because he’s going die soon anyways
Where is nato Where is all other countries 🤔
It is time to take the terrorist Vladimir out in a special operation. This is Putins plan and not the Russians.
Ukrainians are already leaving their country and their army is leaving the frontlines, that's not what they said they will be doing
Can't we at least control the airspace like in Syria? Seems like NATO should consider controlling Ukranian air space to reduce shelling, though obvs this could lead to NATO casualties.
I'm sorry but didn't we make ukraine sign an anti-nuke treaty to be part of the EU in 2014? If we had allowed them to have sovereignty under OUR RULE and allowed them to protect themselves, they'd be safe right now and putin wouldn't have ANY bargaining chips. 🤷‍♂️✌️👌
Putins got the west by the gonads 😂
Horrible.
Self defense that is the biggest bs I have ever heard
Translation:Welcome to the new world order.
Why? Why does Putin want this?
Việt Nam tin tưởng Ukraine 🇻🇳❤️ 🇺🇦
This damage and casualties brought  because of it's foolish leaders and because of NATO not Russia
Zelensky brought this on his people.He believed the US provocations and egging ons...
Putin needs a slap and so do the rest of the leaders of the world.
The US is responsible, much of Russia's population is Russian. He supported Ukrainian chauvinists to harass their minorities. He supported becoming a member of NATO. What did you think? Did you forget Cuba?rWhat did  think US , that  Russia would allow the bomb to be placed in its door?rIf Ukraine does not want to be a member of NATO and respects the rights of minorities, there would be no war.
We as Americans can't sit by and watch Putin destroy Ukraine...
My prayers to Ukrainian from 🇮🇳india
RUSSIA WILL INVADE ALASKA..!!
now we understand WHY Ukraine would want to join NATO
What i really need to know how strong is ukrainian army? Why arent they on attack nor even defended the boundary,i mean what the hell
Instantly I decree the immense peace of GOD ALMIGHTY. The LORD OF HOSTS shall arise and protect HIS People.
Zelensky is irresponsible he brought this war to his people. He should have trade NATO dreams for Donbas area. Poor Ukrainians.
Hope Usa is not behind all of this again.
WHY RUSSIAN SOLDIERS NOT CONCERN? WHY THEY WANT WW3? THEY ARE ALL EVIL IF THEY START WW3.
My heart goes to people of Donbass
Yo Russia needs to chill TF out
What about the American news reporters I guess they are going to be sacrifice
Again only common people going to be in loss
Of course the US is behind this, same as NATO. They don’t care about Ukraine’s people. Look back in History.
If goat carry a cat in back and go to jungle of course tiger will eat and cat can’t do anything.
May God  Bless Russia / Ukraine . I’m Against The War!!!! Let’s Be In Peace Forever. 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Crimea River.
Omg 😱 😭god bless 🇺🇦
I hope this act wont be forgotten.
This is what you get when you elect a comedian as a president....everything is a joke.
BBC is a bias
This is not about politics but is economic development and your own family (Ucraina) dealing with your enemies USA I full support Putin and the Russian people .
Imagine walking along the street, going about your business and there's some idiot from the BBC wearing a bulletproof vest ranting and raving about something happening 500 miles away. 😂
Pity part is those strong enough to tell and force Putin off Ukraine have also in the past invaded other weaker countries and have nasty history.So the likes of US ,UK have also done anti humanitarian acts on other nations.
Nope, NATO will not help you. Like 83 years ago when the world was watching Nazis where bombing Poland. We know what happen after that, right?
God Bless Russia. God Save Ukraine. And Down With Dictator Putin.
Russia is purely evil way worse than China
TF is wrong with putin
Targeting fleeing civilians straight to war crimes for the Russians they never change
fuck this peps in power i dont want war.no one wins
KOSOVO,  MACEDONIA,  MOTENEGRO,  BOSNIA  ARE  GREAT SERBIA
Putin can snarl and look tough all he wants. But he should realize by now that he is in Xi Jin Ping's pocket. Without Xi's support this invasion of Ukraine would not have been possible. ❣and support for the people of Ukraine.
Poland waring about that many years and most western country ignore that by decades   looks that taked prise  putin is  maniak and mentaly instable  now is other conflict  gonna start  China taiwan  Israel Iran and USA has not leader   is worst sytuation from 2 world war and more dangerous
Praying for Ukraine at least they not giving up like the afghans
10 - 20 comments every 1 - 2 seconds.... definitely not bots! 😂
the  american mess , innocient people paying the price
Please Lord, protect your people 🙏
Ukraine don't back down keep fighting it's your country you must defend it .....
Why crying bullshit
Russia has every right to protect his people that were being murder by bombs fired at them it's called self defence
I wish all of people in this world love and live in peace. Pray for Ukraine and Russia 😢. Remember, Pandemic has not stopped yet, A war will make some new problems in this world , Lets pray for them
Over the decades and centuries how many countries has Britain and its allies invaded?? Obviously reading the majority of the comments….many have absolutely no idea what’s been going on in eastern Ukraine for the past seven years!
It's is not civilian these are all military points
Ukraine 🇺🇦❤️🙏🏽🇰🇿
Just start WWIII It will happen anyway
What is difrence when UK and USA bombed Baghdad and thousand people died then it was normal and justifed West Hyporatic shitters.
Draft us all. Put this man child in his place😂
Im hating this whole scenario.. why dont they just talk it out? I won't blame russia nor america because matter is simple as this...  There is no way United nations going make an army, those peace keepers.how much money are we wasting for this ridiculousness. (for eg; league of nations) countries don't try to give some of their troops without out regarding  nothing would be insane so that countries are trying to do is build an empire like former Soviet union or current NATO.... World is not going into some sort of world war or something like that but countries will change its dipomacy... And the so called citizens all over the world will understand we are just people... Sometimes i wonder why do we pay taxes.. for this?
The West have been invading countries in the Middle East for ages. Russia is just copying the vicious tactics of the West and implementing it in Europe. This is a dangerous escalation.
No, this is the conflict the US and NATO want, that's why they ignored the Russia's security proposal. Every Russian, you should know the truth, the conflict is triggered by the West, they don't care about your lives neither the lives of Ukrainians. The West wants to destroy your country and enslave you!
Putin has told his people that ours is a peaceful country,, the troops are pulling back, there will be no war that no slav wants, and then he attacked.Make no mistake people of Russia, such as me, are shocked, we thought it was political manuvers yet now a war noone wants has broken out. The guy lost the last shreds of his legitimasy or any right to represent us.
Russia has been a menace to the world for much to long.  Same with china.  The world is in such a mess and it's just going to keep getting worse because of spite  greed and hate..   God help us all
I feel bad for ukraine. They dont have trump to protect them. They have sleepy joe that will do nothing to help.
Why putin have to do this war? I cant see any honor in this.
Get the guns ! Fight them evil regime...
If those buildings  were hit by rockets surely we  would see some damage to the masonry, and yet the pictures you show (the worst damage ) only shows blown out windows, so my guess is  the explosion was nearby and this is a pressure wave from it. Windows can be blown out and make a lot of mess a long way from a large bomb.
I wonder if the s.a.s is already embedded  just a quick mooch from the Kremlin.🤔
Putin has just signed his death warrant
Shame Putin God will punish you
oh boy the ukrainans will pay for every second when they poke out and woke up the bear from its cave with the 
I highly recommend watching Wion channel that showed history of Ukraine in a nutshell and beautifully stated.https://youtu.be/nK-yJD_fAtk PAST IMPERIALISM CANNOT JUSTIFY PRESENT-DAY EXPANSIONISM.
Putin has no human feelings. There is a deep darkness in his soul.
We love PEACE... ALWAYS ❤️❤️❤️❤️👍👍👍 PEEEEAAACCCCEEEEEE
Poor people. Where is Nato now? Where is Eu now? They all cook that war!
Stop the War! This is terrible!
💕💕💕
Not sure press is safe to be there now
Joe biden will bring peace to the world... where are all the people against Donald Trump before???
This is about NATURAL RESOURCES AND GAS LINES. PUTIN YOU'RE GARBAGE
How the hell is attacking airports considered self defense? WHAT A JOKE.
Did Putin call them nazis?
To be an Enemy of USA is Dangerous but to be Friends is Lethal. - Henry Kessinger (American)
You guys are subjective. You supose to be objective
nah. putin is hunting space nazis i heard.
as a russian i agree
russians are most humble people on earth. its just putin launched his space nazi chase. it takes its toll if ones has to lurk in bunkers few years. because covid.
If Ukraine really don’t want a war, they can surrender. NATO is not going to intervene, and Ukraine is nothing compared to the military might of Russia. Just surrender and avoid casualties
Admit Ukraine to Nato now,  the only way to stand up to a bully,. Putin like Hitler has shown he has no respect for international norms. It's time for the European debating club to take a stand either they stand for something or they stand for nothing. The same goes for the UN, there are thousands of young Americans lying under crosses all over Europe, they gave their youth and futures in testament to prevent this kind of thing, never again they said. Appeasement now will result in much worse later if this goes unchecked. Have some courage and stand up to this bully. Europe has bled enough over the past 100 years.
I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be an emperor. That’s not my business. I don’t want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone - if possible - Jew, Gentile - black man - white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other’s happiness - not by each other’s misery. We don’t want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone. And the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way.Greed has poisoned men’s souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost…The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men - cries out for universal brotherhood - for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world - millions of despairing men, women, and little children - victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people.To those who can hear me, I say - do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed - the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish…Soldiers! don’t give yourselves to brutes - men who despise you - enslave you - who regiment your lives - tell you what to do - what to think and what to feel! Who drill you - diet you - treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder. Don’t give yourselves to these unnatural men - machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men! You have the love of humanity in your hearts! You don’t hate! Only the unloved hate - the unloved and the unnatural! Soldiers! Don’t fight for slavery! Fight for liberty!In the 17th Chapter of St Luke it is written: “the Kingdom of God is within man” - not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! In you! You, the people have the power - the power to create machines. The power to create happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure.Then - in the name of democracy - let us use that power - let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world - a decent world that will give men a chance to work - that will give youth a future and old age a security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power. But they lie! They do not fulfil that promise. They never will!Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people! Now let us fight to fulfil that promise! Let us fight to free the world - to do away with national barriers - to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men’s happiness. Soldiers! in the name of democracy, let us all unite!-Charlie Chaplin. The Great Dictator end speech.
Putin is a bully period.
Putin is boasting of accurate missiles hitting military targets but instead hitting civilians.
Oh…may peace and mutual confidence be in the world.!
So it begins
Prayers and love from Australia 💜
40 dead in a weekend is still safer than a weekend in the summer in Chicago.
This is what you get when you go in bed with NATO 🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
So putin is the new Hitler We all need to mass on Ukraine from Japan Ireland UK France Turkey Israel SC Taiwan Germany all need to mass on Ukraine the USA already have all the guns and war toys ready for everyone willing to go to Ukraine fight for our very freedom.I got some inside info China will send many ships and troops over to Ukraine. Turkey must block the black sea cut of Russia ships destroy trapped Russia ships If Russia USA 1 nuke France Israel Germany UK USA will rain hell down on Russia. Pity cos I love the USA people and would love to know what they think of all this
Yankee poodle news
If Russia 🇷🇺 successfully invaded to Ukraine 🇺🇦 China will also invade to  Taiwan 🇹🇼 and only western support will be words with no actions this is all sings that western can't  able to  support their partners
I feel sad for each and every living being over there 🤍
Why war...it will damage the society,  climate , food , people etc....
Now time to All out war against Russia also China needs to stop
Only if World had shown similar solidarity to middle east, we wouldn't be seeing the dismantled region that we see now. My heart goes out for fellow Ukrainians. Putin started a war against people who were once family and lived together,  putin is a monster.

Ukraine president is still in deny

Putin let them test they medicine after Ukraine voted against Libya on 2011, swift military 🇷🇺.
We indians we stand with Ukraine
Russia : 
So it begins
Poor russians were enslaved long time ago
How long before people wake the fuck up and realise its the politicians who want this war not the soldiers or normal folk. Wake the fuck up.
what were they doing from one month , in the bible it is written sharpen ur knifes before the war
if the police do nothing, the bully  will do what he wants of course
Both Ukraine and Russia will benefit from this Ukraine just needs to surrender to Russia
This is heart breaking, Russia attacks Ukraine, I think even some part of military feel bad cuz of that and many tried to quit, but Vladimir Putin has much power and can decide almost everything in it's way, that's very sad to see such stupidity from the leaders of the world. Praying for everyone, especially for people that have nothing to do with the war, Ukrainian people, kids that don't deserve this part that it's seen  and hope somehow, others can stop it, but the war already started, the numbers of deaths are keep growing and many people don't have any fault, i hope this won't go to far away.. It's not a subject to make jokes about it, so people pray for those people and if u can help do it, we are the humanity. Stay strong guys! 🙏🏻🇺🇦
As a Canadian I hope Ukrain wins and defeats Russia. But we all know that is not going to happen. Russia will win, and if we the G7 countries want to insure a world war does not happen, we have to close our eyes.
Putin stared the WAR you say ? I don’t think so
We stand with Russia 🇷🇺 👏 Victory putin the best president ever
This is a consequence of not listening to general George S.Patton !
Read your history & see what the Ukrainian's did to the Jews in WW2 .
Ukraine must be neutral,to avoid problems.Must not ever believe US,UK & NATO,who r WarMongers,Liers & Cowards,who are responsible for the killing of more than 1 million innocent lives in Iraq,Libya,Syria,Vietnam etc.They lied,that,they won't expand NATO towards Russia in 1991.
Yea, where is all  those crab lice who was praising up Russia putin.  You happy about this great crime taking place in this mordern world. This is the end for putin. He will pay a price for this crime.
On a lighter note somebody animated a video of the missile strike turning it into a dildo........so theres that.
You don't speak for the people of Ukraine.
Russia is such a joke of a country. A failed country stolen by one man, with a very backwards mentality. Russia is a disgusting nation.
You know nothing about our countries and the situation, so why are you even speaking?
 @【Фулл Хаус】  You all should just shut up and let this happen. We need a nuclear winter for the good of the earth
 @【Фулл Хаус】  you know nothing about my comment and my opinion, so why are you even speaking?
 @【Фулл Хаус】  your country has a long history of lying including Putin too. You don’t have to be there to know when someone is lying sir
Ukrainian citizens do not have the spirit of nationalism, preferring to flee
Well...the United Nations became just another League of Nations
From someone living in Belarus to all Ukrainians out there - Belarusian people stand with you in your struggle. Thanks to Lukashenko and his regime russian troops came to our country and made themselves at home, telling us stories of how they're going to 
Why this looked like Planetside the armor column
This is heartbreaking, no one would want a war to put all their loved ones in a dangerous situation. World peace is all we need right now.
Trusting the nato to defend is the biggest mistake done by Ukraine.
Will Remember in my prayers
The Lord will make a way when there's seems to be no way ,
I don't care what is happened, but please save the Ukraine Crazy drummers. LOL
Did you guys pray for people of Iraq? Syria? Afghanistan? Libya? Serbia? Did God bless that brave people over there?
Ukraine messed with Russia,now thers the result ☠️☠️
FIRST, It's time to shut down Putin's personal wealth that he stole from the Russian people.SECOND, shut down all free world Russian Embassy and kick them out.THREE, cut off all Russian internet assets. Make the little green man feel the pain!
Putin should stop war you are moderate Hitler😡😡 stays strong Ukraine
I pray that Putin will get was is coming to him....Only HIM he will have to answer to higher power 💯💯💯💯🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽My prayers out to the ppl who is being affected by greed and stupidity by Putin 😢😪😪😪
Dear God, I know things aren't working for you. You have 2 men called 'STRONG' who use your name to HYPNOTISE their army to TAKE THE USA and the UKRAIN for the OLIGARTHY. One of your faithful said he's the 2nd coming and the other said he's coming to get us all... and probably spray us with 'ZYKLON_B.
Shame on the US government!!!
为什么要战争
American people are so lost in the propaganda sold by the media and the government. Here they don’t even know what’s happening in reality.
Putin = Hitler, Russia 2022 = Nazi Germany 1939-1945
They ( ukrainian people ) loose from the joke of evil soviet to be freedom and democracy ; now evil putin wants them back to russia regime under new communism under Putin.
Ukraine should have sat with Russia and Europe instead of listening to US and negotiated both sides should have compromised a little this wouldn't have happened
Where is NATO.....such a puppet
This mf said “ self defense “ 😂 fuck putin
US & Nato needs to go all in & stop russia..otherwise UN has no teeth.face the music now or these other powerful countries will just take over any country they want.
🇺🇦🇺🇦🇱🇷🇱🇷 💔💔💔💔😭😭😭 my condolences to Ukrainian from the black republic of liberia. While we should avoid saying or doing anything hateful, we need to go further. The cycle of hatred begins in the mind and heart. Therefore, we must root out any hint of hatred from our thoughts and feelings
The Ukrainian people and army are laying down there arms and will not fight. I feel Ukraine is already lost. Show the world and the Russian army that you will fight. Fight for your country, tooth and nail, otherwise the Russians have already won!
Citizens should have had recognized when they were becoming the puppets of west and overthrowing legitimate govt of Ukraine in Coup. Now they are paying for their own foolishness.
BBC knows that Zelensky is to blame for the provocations
It sucks to see this happening, my deepest thoughts go out to those affected in Ukraine! Sending all my love from the UK <3
Ukraine will capitulate!have no will to fight!walk over for russia!
False flag. Russia didn’t start it. Scaremongering by the media with lies. Thick ppl think Russia just invaded ppl with brains see what we just did to stitch up Russia. Fuck Joe Biden.
Oh  Dear God
Dear UK why don't you nuke russia when you wilk react
BBC propaganda 24/7
If the whole world doesn't back up Ukraine financially and take military action against Russia, Putin will not stop at Ukraine!!
America destroyed many countries now it's time to Russia.

That love you are sending does  Jack shit
Thank you 🇬🇧
America probably needs to do a Soleimani on Putin in Moscow in broad daylight. But if the Russians can retaliate then that probably wouldn't happen.
 @Wahyu Indrasto  Yes. They can retaliate. Not if. They can and will.
So when are you leaving Falklands and Gibraltar ? And Calling back your Military ?
UK will soon be under Russia control......
 @Streetz CultureTV  that will never happen
 @kamysamaa  I agree
PUTIN is supporting FREEDOM AND THE INDEPENDENCE of Eastern Ukraine.You guys shamelessly support separatists in Taiwan and yet whining about what Putin is doing in the Ukraine. Pathetic.
Guys,YaH The Heavenly FATHER HIMSELF was Who they Crucified for our sins and “HERE IS THE PROOF”From the Ancient Semitic Scroll: 
 @Дед Мазай  can you elaborate on this? How long ago did this happen? I'm not doubting you, I'm genuinely curious
Peace will never come as long as Ukraine join NATO FORCE .How would USA feel if Russia starts to join forces with USA Neighbours ???I don't understand why USA/NATO had to build defensive forces on Russia Neighbouring Countries .Face the consequence now 🤦
Agreed. Im going to school with a poster
 @Veztai  AYO HE IS PUTING IN DISGUISE
Britisher be ready India is coming to conquer uk give us queen elizabeth as hostage
 @Streetz CultureTV  if Russia attack uk India ,African and asian countries will sure help Russia Uk needs to be collonsied
 @Buddha Indian  🤣😅🤣
 @Buddha Indian   Sad that people still believe those of “modern” day Europe (citizens that have ZERO to do with the actions of their ancestors), should be punished and killed… What flawed and ignorant logic.
 @Tamara Carter  he's a troll, most of us don't think that way
@KevFaheyGaming sure, that helps
 @Дед Мазай  Because everyone listening one side of the story
The West remains silent on Ukraine, but when Syria and the Eastern Mediterranean become a bomb, you know how to bomb.
 @Zarrar 9  Both places voted to stay British why go against the people's wishes?
why won't you watch RT then? lol
Nice picture! Why would you eat we believe you anything

Stop adding fake news they are all the same people Ane occurs they support putins idea of invading Ukraine 🇺🇦
কুপা সামছু
Interesting, i talked to my Russian friend on ground and she claimed that Russia is helping ukraine. Up to now am questioning my sanity. Are Russians not given the right information  about this🤔
It's sad one man can do this to the whole world 🌎.  This is a war against the world. Praying for Ukraine 🇺🇦 🙏. Praying for children they are out of their home. Praying for the moms they are crying. Praying for the fathers deafening their home. I wish I could do more  than praying 🙏 😪
Zelinsky looks like a jerk and Russia surely is going to  take this jerk to task.
Russia is evil after what the world has gone through they could have solved this with talks and deplomacy
Jesus Christ is the Way, the Truth, the Life. No one comes to the Father except through Him. There is no other intermediary. May Jesus Bless you, trust Him, give your life - and He will take care of it :pray Convert yourself and believe in the Gospel - Romans 10 8-10 But what does it say? “The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart,” that is, the message concerning faith that we proclaim: 9 If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved.  : Why this division, in the evil world we are in, we will be treated as objects and put to fight against each other. This is not what human life should be about. What is the point of wars, the constant enrichment of small units that they erode on the people they use in their plan. It is clear where this is going, we are only a pawn in the game and evil wants to use us for its purposes. There isn't much time left. No matter where you come from, who you are: Christ Is Waiting for you now. Wake up while there's still a chance. May God Keep u in His care. An interesting thing about a disease that was created in laboratories by man. You don't remember any other flu: avian, swine, hiv virus that was also created by the human hand. The whole system of pharmacy [I recommend checking the meaning of the word pharmakeia] is not about treatment, but about stuffing the wallets of regular customers, leading them to death.  it's all business, people do not mean love: just look at what is happening in the world. Evil has no friends, does not know what love or loyalty is - it fights against its own. How to overcome evil? A simple way: apply love to him and wait for reactions. Evil doesn't know what it is, the easiest way to deal with the problem.  [MT 24] And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you. 5For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many. 6And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. 7For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. 8All these are the beginning of sorrows. 9Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name’s sake. 10And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another. 11And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many. 12And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. 13But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. 14And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come. [...] Christ is more powerful than the evil that now rules in this world. 
Now let us see reaction from NATO and U.S. How they can protect Ukraine 🇺🇦?  It is not easy as counterpart is Russia. The biggest fault of Ukraine is they gave up their own nuclear weapons.
I was always a fan of Putin and Russia. But not anymore. I feel very sorry for Ukraine :(
my country India is the fourth strongest country in the world but still i don't know whey we're neutral i mean Russia gave us lotta things and USA gave us love and respect and many more but India have a policy that India will never attack first so yeah i don't what am i sayin but PEACE & LOVE & NEUTRAL
Fucckk !!! War again??????
A pointless war. Putin using 'nazis' like a woke leftist. This is pure greed. Russians and Ukrainians dont want this.
Where is this world going always fighting for what? For something that it’s not ours For something that one day we will die and we won’t have the chance to see again All world should stand and grab a white flag and show the politics that we don’t want war,we want to live in peace 🙏Please stop killing innocent people.

If NATO just assured Russia that Ukraine would not be part of  NATO this destruction would never have happened shame on NATO and west
The only way to beat a super power is guerrilla warfare.
When would NAZI Azov battalion start to carry white helmets on CNN
The US, GB and Russia pledged the territorial integrety of Ukraine in 2014. Russia lied, the others failed miserably. The US has to step up to its leadership of 'the west and set an 'leave or die' ultimatum. This should have happened in 2014. If this fails, we lose the bet we agreed to. We in Germany lived with that shit for 40 years. This will happen anyway, given that no one is willing to follow any meaningful rule anymore. If the US doesn't step up, it will lose it's claim of leadership. It seems no one is willing to live near the new Berlin Wall.
Praying for UKRAINE 🙏 from Philippines 🇵🇭
Nuclear war is not the answer,but might be already too late.
So the western allies will place sanctions and hope Putin backs down...where's Nato and the military presence needed to deter Russian advance
they hitting the air bases and weapon depot  but UK has taken out 50 tank and 6 air craft  so go get them ukraine
What is Ukrainian Army doing?
Communist  Soviet  didn't destroy Nazism,instead they swallowed it and it's characteristics,  so it is clear now tht the world can see Hitler grabbing German-speaking  population to be part of Third riech ( SAME AS PUTIN GRABBING RUSSIAN-SPEAKERS IN UKRAINE)
Not a democracy
Biden was right all the time
QPrayers sent 🙏 ❤️ I TOLD YOU NOT TO EVER TRUST PUTINNEVER EVER TRUST RUSSIA YOU HAVE TO ANSWER MILITARY 🪖 STRENGTH NOT WITH DIPLOMACY BUT WITH OVER POWERING STRENGTH Q

Exactly....what they showing so openly now has been going on for decades.
I wonder if all these leftests who welcome fake refugees, will be as keen to see people fleeing a real power arrive in their country.
Someone needs to put Russia down. It's a country of monsters! We should never have let them into out society!!!
send here to USA let’s get it on already
Why didn't Nato attack Russia earlier is what we will be saying!!
Ничего страшного
LONG  LIVE  MOTHER  RUSSIA  &  SERBIA  !   🇷🇺🇷🇸
Oh the drama from the BBC, as if they don't know why this is happening.
PUTIN any chance of bombing the BBC NEWS offices please ? Pretty 😍 Please
Putin is Hitler
If US and world will not intervene then China can attack Taiwan! Taiwan should be wary and prepare...
Best thing Ukraine can do is surrender. United States and Nato stop interfering. Everything will be ok after that..
Enough of this fake news noncense. Stop saying untrue things and stop messing arounnd in other countries and the world will become a better place.I am against war and military actions, but you hypocrates created this. Why you did not say anything about Kosovo?Why there was no such tv presence of how the Serbs suffered there? The situation there was absolutely the same as in Ukraine. Is Ukraine NATO? - No. So why the hell you go there and provoce a conflict? You tried the same with Georgia, in South Osetia - gave them empty promisses and then what  - left them. Same is here. Tried it with Kazakhstan for only one reason to get the resources of Russia and become more richer.  And by the way I am not pro Putin, I don't like his policy.
Acha waguze kenya 😁😂
it's all because of the progress of NATO
When US attacks a country due to its own selfish strategic interest , it's hailed as Champion of democracy and when Russia does the same its demonized...Bloody double standards this world have...I don't support Russia but the fact is the world runs as per American crony capitalism and in this conflict also USA is a big spoil sport.
Why US is worried? What about US invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan?
Sending love to the people of both Ukraine and Russia. I don't think the average person wants war, this is Putin's war. I pray for peace from the USA. 🇺🇸 🌎 ❤️ 🇺🇦

Okay time for Russia to be kick out of the G20, send their Ambassador's packing back to Russia . Lets isolate this country they deserve it, all trade with them should stop . NATO and it's Allies need to match, or dominate the NATO borders with more military, send more war ships to the Baltic Sea / Black Sea . Russia is know friend to any Country except those of Authoritarian or Dictator leadership . Lets now send Ukraine more advance weapons to counter Russian aggression . And in America lock Trump Up, get back some pride and order, by  shunning Fox News, and Sucker Carlson >
This time around 
Putin in a murderer and I have never known one.

Help us, please start WW3...
Good luck Russia , kill all enemy, kill all 😀😀😀😀😀❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Putin is evil at heart!
Joe Biden will fix this he understands foreign policy. This is just what Biden wanted. Everything is planned the way Biden wanted
Thank the weakness and corruption of the US Democratic Party. Just wait until China takes their turn.
When USA & NATO attacks to Afghanistan & Iraq, Israel attacks to Palestine what the UN do there
Good!!’ Kill the Nazis!!!
Putin needs to be brought to justice the same as sadam hussein was in the iraq war with his terrible crimes .These people are inhumane and love war .75 percent of the world wants piece .thinking of you all ukraine from all of the uk.
Russia has a right. We need to stop budding into the business of foreign countries
Love putin from Pakistan 🇵🇰❤️🇷🇺
This is a very problematic situation. Who brought all those neonazis as paramilitary to fight over Russian speaking territory in Ukraine? That's straight of the book 60s CIA trash. It was used to dissociate soviet annexed territory to Europe back in the day and as always it spirals out of control. Why? Because neonazi militias are ethno-oriented in their targeting. Now Ukraine is dealing with what has become ethno-nationalism from Russia, who genuinely does not like such movements messing around with the Russian minority of that country. This could all have been avoided having the US intelligence applied normal paramilitary and normal support of Ukraine's army. There are even episodes of agreement between these militias and Russian separatists, ruling those areas as literally nazi based Republics. This could all have been prevented by supporting Democracy in Ukraine and sovereignty in harmony with the almost 3th of the Russian rooted population of its country. Look where it got us. The US has a problem within its own Intelligence since its foundation, one no one wants to admit. Now it is Ukraine and the civilians who will suffer. What for?
Defund the BBC
👆77th brigade sock-puppet trolls and bots!👇
Wrong news that are provided from American news lol 😂 Ukraine been attacking Russian speaker in Ukrainian and Russia is supporting
America triggered this war they send weapons to Ukraine
Whole world needs to come together and wipe the Russian military out of Ukraine. No one wins in war everyone's knows this, this should be standard procedure for any country who invades another in 2022
My husband is Ukrainian and he has a lot of family and friends in Ukraine and we are devastated and terrified because of there safety 😭😭😭😭 Putin is a coward!!! 😡😡😡
selenzky shoud surrender to stop bloodshed.
greedy putin very greedy imagine he's in power for almost 30 years
NATO 👹👺👹👺👹👺👹👺
Idiot putin is going to make his people starve
Putin a man with balls !
Thank the USA and Nato.
I have to say I'm shocked! I didn't think he would really do it. Obviously, there is zero Fs given about what the world thinks about his actions.
No one will help you! That’s the sad truth! Run away!
Thry were enjoying when innocent Palestinian Kashmiris, Syrians were dying, now see how it feels when rockets fall on their country
War pigs … Black Sabbath!!
If we knew for a fact that Putin would attack... why didn't we enforce the Peace Accord like he asked?  Instead we threatened a madman holding a bomb... that we would cancel his credit card.  This is gross negligence by our leaders.
Where's the actual fighting? This is bullshit.
The little man wants to be empore of the new USSR
Putin is absolutely right Ukraine is a threat because the US and NATO AR a threat
Still happy about the US/UK engineered 2014 C0UP? Maybe Victoria Nuland can hand out cookies again on the Maidan?

not really Putin wants NATO influence out of Ukraine entirely
 @Wolverine123  if ukrain wants to join its not up to him to invade and kill   is it ?    doing what hes doing only shows nato is needed
Nato said ukraine aint gang
The main instigator of the Russia-Ukraine war is America and Europe!War does not bring peace to mankind, so tell America and Europe to lift sanctions on Russia
please putin cease fire
Lay ring of land mines around key access points for tanks into Ukraine. Deploy teams with backhoes to dig large trenches so tanks cannot pass, mine both the trenches and the area on approach side of trenches, if Russia ground troops try to dig the earth to fill trenches BOOM!, IF THEY MANAGE TO MAKE IT TO TRENCHES,.,BOOM! TACTICS CAN OVERCOME NUMBERS.3
Take out NATO
God help Ukrain people🙏🙏🙏
Also I'm praying for the 6000 dead after Turkish invasion in Cyprus.And no one has cared
NATO -US  goal: Sell weapons to threatened countries, wage economic war on Russia. US makes money. NATO achieves its goal. Idiotic Ukrain leader fall into their trap.
Why? Why? Why?.  MIR, мир, Peace, Paix, Frieden ,..Is this word don't exist
Of course he lied its called the element of kinda surprise duh
Poetin& the kremlin should be 
Why they just ain’t make a deal with Russia 🤦🏽‍♂️
Why don't you people worry about the US and about what's happening here that could be us you don't believe it they didn't either God save us all
Russia would have not gone this far if it wasn't for our sniveling coward in the white house.!!
Tomorrow Russia map will be bigger to include ukraine.I recommend that the Ukrainian army surrender and stop fighting against the power of Russia and be killed at the end.Unfortunately Russia is strong. No point to cause more death.
Go Putin... Let me grab pop corn, the u.s middle east invasion movie got very long and boring..
very sad...war means casualties..seen in Iraq, Afghan, Palestine,now in Ukraine...God save us
Where are the other european countries why their not helping ukrain
Somebody ought be tried for war crimes when his own people finally do get their way and depose him.
I guess we're reaching points of no return
Fuck the NATO
wow lucky that Putin had months to set up his army all around the Ukraine,  before they 
Biden 😂🤲🏻
Ukraine should have kept the nuclear weapons.
Every one out there doing fake sighs and prayers for this but is anyone out there ready for buying the dip in both stocks and crypto If yes which one ur into??
Put your ego in your pocket Putin and go home...you have enough land .

But this means cheep Ukrainian babes for the rest of us!🥳
Europe war  is Coming  Stupid Biden and freaking Putin... Will be sorted very soon u will see..Showing Russia is still able to kick and not scared of USA or NATO... If he shows fear he's done..These is a game u will see in a week,... Nuclear weapons smoothly can delete Ukraine and rest.And he have it. Fear is what he wants....  Prayers to Ukraine people,,..ALLWAYS SMALL PEOPLE  GET FUCKED ..
This is not a war that the US wants eitherI do feel bad for the people of Ukraine, but at same time I don't, this is a nation that is in need of defending Itself, if the shoe was on the other foot, would Ukraine defend the US against a Russian invasion?, I highly doubt it
The russia is defending itself by attacking ukraine thats has done anything
Seems to me that Ukrainians should have been preparing for this for months. Patriotic Ukrainians need to start adopting terrorist tactics real quick if they want to defend their country. This isn't a job for American soldiers, though.
Is the world on the very brink of  World War III? Full scale invasion of Ukraine is a casus belli! Russia is waging a psychological warfare on Nato Members, it set out on the assumption that since it possesses more stockpiles than any other nuclear weapons state , Putin'sRussia  believes it could march on Kiev without any consequences. He has set right under our noses a precedent. Will the other authoritarian countries ,namely China , Turkey ,or North Korea follow in the footsteps of Russia? Chattering the world fragile sense of security. Emboldened by the large number of nuclear warheads at their disposal. The UN is completely overwhelmed by power states' s behaviors in a world of anarchy. How would Nato member states react , would this occupation lead other countries to build up their own nuclear capabilities ? Endangering further the world peace at large ? Who would be the next victim of Putin expansionism to reclaim more territories which Russia lost following the collapse of the Soviet Union
Dear Ukrainian, please drop your weapon and surrender to Putin.
One of my teacher in university was telling that there is only economic warfare in the future, but it was wrong.
There is really only need for ONE casualty.

Piggy Putin hungry for land
hey, what NATO are looking for this situation? are they not helping to save Ukrainian? sad!
要是川普是美国总统.俄罗斯不敢入侵
its the war mongering NATO alliance that caused this unfortunate situation by gradually expanding on NATO influence in Europe in violation of all previous treaties promising not to expand NATO  influence. Your expansion  finally got to the Russian border. Keep trying to deceive the world in to thinking that Russia is the big bad villain.
Stand with Russia. Let traitors bleed
This is when we need someone like trump
This is why NATO or UN or the EU union are just bureaucrats living out of public taxes and is useless when it comes to solving problems.
NATO means NO ACTION ONLY TALKSFINALLY  sly EU and NATO  have  Ukrainian people into helplessness and refugees, This is what West does use ,discard, and cast aside their so called friends, this is their history and future. Selfish west.
F*ck you Russia and Putin
Ukraine President “We are not afraid “... Putin “umm okay” ATTACK!
WHY THE FUCK DO WE DO THIS?? WE ARE ALL HUMANS!!
Praying for everyone in the Ukraine.
Imagine innocent people have to die because puttin is bored and powerful sad 😔 my heart goes out to the families of Ukraine 🇺🇦
Look the Sun is risingNo wait, that's not the Sun
nato terrorists start all wars
God bless putin and long live Russia!!!! The Ukrainian government was overthrown by nazi racist and is now being run by them.  So death to tyrants and racist God bless putin
Where is Boris and Trudu ....... when you need them??
NATO also bombed Belgrade and Serbia. The world didn't care. The SAME situation with Kosovo. Double standards... (same with Lybia, Syria, Iraq...)
Not our war
For 8 years UA army was shooting and killing people in Donbass. Their lives doesn't matter anything for you? Do you remember what happend in Odessa? Do you remember, how your politicians were unsilted Russia, and asking for a cheap gas at the same time? Zelensky said, that he'll not execute Minsk agreements straight forward, he doesn't want to speak with people from Donbass. So what did you expect after such impudent behavior? That Putin will sit down and look at these murders, while people in Donbass are dying?
BBC,  british bomb commentators. Keep pushing war. Despicable
This is war!! Don’t know what the west are waiting for .. Putin is doing what he thinks is right but is the west doing what they think is right! The world has failed Ukraine 😞

Shame on Putin
Beware of fake news...on both sides.
The ppl are now taking this serious when the us told them they didn’t listen
Do you know how hard is to find this many people in moscow streets who speaks English.
Putin: Its just a prank, bro.
I think it's ridiculous that the UKRAINE citizens believe their army can stand up to Russia.   Cmon
why everyone looking bad at russia when uk and america killed mllions in iraq and afghanistan and invaded?
I wish I could send enough love to this people that they keep strong and good hearted while they are dealing with all this sh***. This is so unfair and useless...  And if I had the courage, I would come and fight with you.
This is the end result of Ukraine GIVING UP their NUCLEAR WEAPONS due to pressure from USA, France & Britain. Now Ukraine is getting bombs from all corners, there is no France,  Britain or USA to physically help Ukraine fight Nuclear Nation of Russia. Very SAD, l wish, l can join Ukrainian insurgents to fight the Russians. With Love from USA.
What about Palestine, Syria? Doesnt anyones heart bleed for them anymore?
Ok we need a seal team 6 to go into Russia and give Putin the Bin Laden treatment, and fast.
Screw Putin
I never believe they’d actually invade for real. I thought it’s another of the western media propaganda and co. Mehn, wtf is wrong with Putin 🤦🏽‍♂️…nigga just be acting like some gangster shit..,blowing up airport
Asesino
This is murder!  There will be justice!
Twain will be next if Biden shows no balls
war must come usa must learn to mind their own business thry want to control everything haha china and russia must show nato they are kids
An unutterably clear mockery was made of USA and EU.
And there's actual dirt filth people supporting Russia.
Poopin just made history as modern day Hitler.
Thry honestly dont care what innocent people hey hurt and kill, people are just numbers they will go to hell. I cant believe in the obedience of soldiers are they totally irreligious?
Good while Bombing Ukraine better get Hunter Now LoL...🇺🇸🏴‍☠️🤠👹👺🤡🤡🤡👎👎👎👉👌🤭🤭🤭
here we go. more ruthless and stupid old men sending bombs and young men and women into war
https://youtu.be/fy910FG46C4
This is where we see how NATO uses other countries to expose their enemy's hand. NATO is just as evil as any military organization used as pawns. Just stop the fighting and stop the greed!!
Where is the Ukraine army at?
https://youtu.be/thADhg3M3yIhttps://youtu.be/thADhg3M3yI
GOD PROTECT ALL THE LOVELY PEOPLE OF UKRAINE!!! AMEN
Destructive!
Greetings  to prince Andrew
Ukraine ❤️...War is began 24.02.2022 5:00. Russia vs Ukraine
All them cars on the road not looking good for me
They should join russia
God bless Russia & Vladimir Putin xxxxx
This horrible gangster. I hope it's the end of this monster. We in western Europe will look back at this moment in history with deep shame for not really helping the Ukrainian people.
I feel like if all those civilians living in Russia really wanted to make a stand against what's going on then they should stage a mass hunger strike in major cities to show the government how far regular people are willing to fight for peace.
Praying for everyone in Ukraine is safe, I hope this fight will end
Ukraine is lost to Russia. They are waiting on the US, UK and Europe to help defend them and it's unlikely to happen until their country barely exist. This has always been. This should be an awakening to anyone waiting on other countries to save them.
Maybe if the liberal West had not spent the last 10 years eating itself we would of been better prepared.
Where is so-called American support?!
Libya, Iraq, Syria.....I forgot before.....think about that....use your brain
Russia's crime against humanity. Putin has dug his grave.
China is watching quietly and patiently waits for the western to kill their own economies over sanctions on Russia.
Why would Russian civilians allow this to happen? Why would they hide inside like rats?

Blessed  be  Putin  to  nuke  Germany.
Why da fuck arent they shooting back
GALATIC FEDERATION MAYBE ON THEIR WAY DOWN TO PLANET EARTH,
Pro Ucraina, I'm romanian!  Peace for Ukraine from UK
To War with Russia 🇷🇺 I want to have Russian War Slaves
All of the west should send their armed forces in, shouldn't be that hard to corner Russia once everyone unites..
Russia will invade Ukraine, Russia will be properly severely punished. MadMan Putin will nuke a couple of Ukraine trouble spots and hopefully, MadMan Putin will be sitting in the Kremlin when Moscow is correctly and properly fried. Then maybe the boneheads, each ruling their little piles of dirt, will honestly move to eliminate Nuclear Weapons. (OK... I laugh at this a little. After the big ones, every BoneHead with any pretense of leadership will be hand shoveling out his own little dirt home to  live in just like every other remaining citizen of Earth.)
Nothing will be done in Russia, in Ukraine, in China or in the whole world, pandemic or war, without consent of Rothchild and Rockefeller. So be careful about this.
Taiwan is next
Go go uncle Putin
Ukraine 🇺🇦 home of zionism 😈😈😈
“ Denazification “ wtf the prime minister is himself Jewish !🤯 this old fuck looking for excuses
If putin wanted to destroy ukraine he would drop a nuke. I think putin just didnt want a military with the plans to build a nuclear arsenal while having entire battallions of nazi sympathizers. Bad combination imo.
May Allah save and protect Ukrainian civillian
Hyaenas are always together . The Tigers 🐅 only fight alone .
Keep praying. They will be converted soon. Recommended to watch:”Heaven’s Key To Peace”
What a horrible evil little man. He sits back warm, safe, and proud while destroying and killing. 💔🥺🕊️
😨😰😓😓
India will always support Russia🇷🇺🇷🇺
Hmmmm.. well a week ago the UKRAINE pres.was all mouth and telling putin to beware ..  seems he's eating those words now and surely regretting shooting his mouth off to putin.  Stupid stupid comments came out that man's mouth.. Now he will pay for that as well will his country and its citizens..  So much for diplomatic approach huh
Prayer for  Ukraine
yes,,Ukraine attacked Russia,,,Russia is to defend ,,the attack,,entering to stop the aggressors in Ukraine.....lower your arms Ukraine,,Ukraine is the aggressors....stop the false treaty,,Indian treaty..in Ukraine...same false treaties never keep......Ukraine started shooting first.....neutral treaty  downer...
Putin says 
If Putin Swallow Ukraine he will swallow More of European countries and he will become emperor again 🧐Then Russia up 🔼  USA and Europe  down ⬇️ 😑..
I think we are too intelligent for war at this point, fix up for crying out loud.
Ukraine needs help very muchrRussia is just tearing contry (for 8 years btw)rrReposts, and praying wont do much. My appreciation, but sorry.
We are sending Prayers from the USA
This is so sad...people are suffering..all this war and for what??..☹
The thing that scares me is once they have Ukraine will they stop
europe must react !!!!
It is so sad, such beautiful people and country. 💔
This is not going to end well.
Russia my heart is with you, we'll stop the pagan nazis
I'm only 20 yrs old! And I haven't seen like this in my whole entire life! This is CRAZY!🤦‍♂️
nat0 was to blame for trying to make ukraine join there regime... go for war. dismatle nat0 regime
Putin is a modern cannibal
That's just horrible, still couldn't realize the whole situation🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
Oh like the protests in Canada. Oh right a got you bbc. 😂 😂 😂.
It’s going to be faster then the takeover of Afghanistan
that scenery is great, into Russia as well b.t.w.
We need to do something! We can’t just let Russia do this to Ukraine! I wish nato can offer open relocation to any nato country so the Ukrainian citizens can escape this madness!Fuck Putin!! He has nukes SO DO WE!!!
Is there anyone who understands putin’s decision, or is everyone here anti putin?
😔 My thoughts go out to Ukraine 🇺🇦 .  #Hope
Croatia stands with Ukraine! 🇭🇷🇺🇦
Russian should go out and protest .. even if arrested what are they going to do ARREST 50% of Russians and house them ? beat up 50% of Russians cause they want to SAVE RUSSIA from crazy PUTLER ?
Between sanctions from Nato and Nukes on Russia border. Any smart leader would choose the former.
Putin ftw this is 2022.
we don't need your prayers,  we need support,  prayers won't hit the missles
Where is Super power US ?
Also is it world war 3??.
Russia is under threat of the Ukraine pro-NATO that might allow NATO's military forces long terms stationed.
Very sad for Ukraine people... Why war... What Russia will achieve... So many people life will be lost...i will pary to God give some mind to putin and stop this war...
Looks like Baiden & Boris johnson wanted this war .. culprits..
European countries can't let Russia attack Ukraine without resistance otherwise what's point in being in nato?
Gauido of Venezuela
The gremlin in the Kremlin must pay for every last brick and damage he does..and indicted by the ICC
1:59 no dont try to get others to help your battle. This is between you guys. Stop trying to get other countries involved
💞🤗💞🤗🙏🙏🙏
Serbia with Russia 🇷🇸🇷🇺
Where is Moscow Mitch when you need him?
https://youtu.be/5SBo0akeDMYThis is what you people are supporting after what they did in Odessa in 2014.. 🤷🏻‍♂️
Yeah, Russia is a very SMALL country, it needs more land to protect its Sovereignty 🤷‍♂😠
Belarus should pay a heavy price
Zelenskiy should realize now he is on his own.  He will likely flee within a week.
USSR is abolished along time ago Ukraine is an Independent Country.
Putin just want statues built for him when he dies......Good people of Russia you can stop him.....In the name of God, please.
I said war was coning. Putin is puting his foot in his mouth. The demons must make you feel like you you are doing the right thing. Just like world war one and 2.
I am not at all disturbed by the cries of the people of Ukraine, because I grew up watching Palestine, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Myanmar, Libyan old and young women and children cry
Just drop at least one nuclear bomb in the center of Russia and the War will be automatically over and there's no need for useless resistance at the boarder.This strategy is already tested during  ww2 when US drop a atomic bomb in Hiroshima Japan.
Why NATO isnt stopping rusia? Or did nato en russia made a plan years ago togheter?😏
Whyd they only ask Russian women and no men? Not very balanced.
What did they expect, Putin to admit when and where he’ll attack?
I am so sorry... i am speechless... i am sad and afraid... i cant imagine the pain this people is going through... i am so sorry
No 😭 war please
The invasion was gonna happen eventually it was just a matter of where and when
I cant imagine having real war with tanks during the era of internet and social media. This will be first hand experience that humanity never had experienced before
Lord please give ukraine a strength. To fight for there freedom. 🙏🙏🙏
Trump met with every dictator before he left office. World war 3 is his doing, he helped these people prepare , he will try to take office again during this war. This is his fault. Do not let him take office again or the US will end up exactly as Russia has. Under childish rule.
Not really sadly :(
fuck you Russia and Putin.. fuck you!!!! and Fuck you USA and EU for being coward. Fuck you people!!!
America's meddling have started yet more blood shed!!!!
At what time did  They attack
Any discussion of modern warfare that does not stress the economics of The Merchants of War and discuss how the incredible ecstasy for the soldier of having such glorious killing toys to play with and being given the godlike power of life and death over any chosen enemy soldiers... Any discussion that does not address these foundation issues is a phony and empty conversation. Warfare is the penultimate transformative and satiating personal experience available to anybody. This is why warfare has remained for tens of thousands of years the most popular human sport. This is also why discussions like the one above with the esteemed Ambassador have little real power.
I don't know everything about their conflict. But I know it isn't worth world war 3. We need to stay out of their issues and watch our borders.
The U.S. has destabilize Iraq, Syria, Egypt, Libya, Yemen and been meddling in Ukraine since 2014..
Yes I'm sure most of Russian people don't want this war but they have no choice with the wrath of the Putin regime sadly 🥺👎
This is heart breaking but hopefully this won’t escalate any further
Can't believe that old man putin starts playing victim as like the Ukraine start this first. Coward!
Russian people don’t want war!!!!!! Please say this to all people you now 🇷🇺🇺🇦♥️
During the Kosovo War, NATO launched its campaign without the UN's approval, stating that it was a humanitarian intervention. The air strikes lasted from 24 March 1999 to 10 June 1999. The bombings continued until an agreement was reached that led to the withdrawal of Yugoslav armed forces from Kosovo.
Well.... I think NATO should expand eastward for Ukraine's sake!Let there be peace! 🕊️
All the best from germany!❤
Awww , poor old sleepy Joe can.t  have his NATO extension. GREEDY PIG
Communist hate nazis why ate u calling communisits nazis
The civilians always suffer the worst in wars and dont understand how humans call themselves most intelligent species on planet but solves things in violence
What a monster!
Why are all of those military age men not in uniforms?
Kiev is not bombed? Americans don't behave like that!
My prayers goes to Ukraine
https://youtube.com/shorts/eCgMVNeko9g?feature=share
Stay strong Ukraine! Keep connected and look after one another. Hoping this nightmare will end soon. Praying from Bangladesh.
Thirst for power never fails
I wonder if Trump and Fox News will continue to pour praise on Putin now
What do they mean where is Nato? They  want to be assisted by what they dont want to be part of, are they members of Nato in the first place?
I just noticed that the russain are trapping them
Kremlin = crimenalKremlin = crimenalKremlin = crimenal
putin is another hitler
America so silent
Reminds me when USA occupied Iraq & middle East countries.
Get rid of Putin and make Russia great.
Chickenshit Biden
The bully Russians need to pick on someone of there own size, not a 1/4 of their size. I hope they feel good. Putin says self-defense? That's funny. You can't tell a country to put your guns down in their home turf, they have to try and protect themselves. Bullies!!
Strong Russia!💪
...it seems we have called Mr Putins bluff :' I no plans to invade Ukraine ...liar, liar. I hope this leads to complete world wide condemnation and has destroyed his reputation as a world leader.
It’s a shame the world can’t work together to prevent the violence. How many innocents have to die before it’s enough. One thing is for sure. The world will remember and they will not forgive Putin
Ukraine should surrender to avoid more casualties, these greedy hounds like US and NATO aren't going to help them.
We’ll only see what God promises...Russia is doomed!
Putin  trimaldito
https://youtube.com/shorts/eCgMVNeko9g?feature=share
Not the same. Afghanistan and Iraq weren't fully developed or sovereign nations.
 @Matthew Ford  just like your brain bro
Well you British could have help with the Minsk treaty ! instead you have chosen War  to please the financial interests of the USA .
My heart and prayers go out to the people of Ukraine. 🙏❤️
What is the endgame for Putin? Why would he attack? I thought he was bluffing but he did it eventually. This will ruin Russia as well as Ukraine. And I dont think Russia's objective will be achieved. They will fail, Ukraine will endure and eventually may defeat Russia with or without nato.Russia will be in ruins both in the military and EconomicallyThen why would Putin take such drastic action? Can someone answer?
We can't worry about this in USA, the US intelligence community couldn't care less, 
Because Ukraine wants to join NATO. Egged on by the United States Ukraine War with Russia. In order to sell weapons. Let's just say the Ukraine government deserved the  beat, poor their ppl
🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
You all can thank Clown Biden for this...War brought to you from people who don't know which bathroom to use and thinks crt is a critical issue and white supremacy is the greatest threat .
Your leader its not human, he has no heart 👎👎👎
Yo boys when this is all over. RUSSIA AS A COUNTRY has lost all respect for their people aka soldiers and power. China and Russia will be public enemies number one if Russia continues cos hitler was the red flag and now we know the warning signs. Putin should be executed and Winnie the Pooh (China) should be left to their own polluted demise as China is a shit country too and their own people can’t stand up for themselves. So seems like call of duty was always right about who the enemy has always been.
Heartbreaking... I am simply heartbroken. How is this possible in 21st century Europe?! Praying for all people of Ukraine.
Speak like china chairman… no sense of remorse…. Keep strong to people of Ukraine…..
Putin has every right, the manipulative hand of democracy forcing it's stake wherever it pleases like a virus. He informed the world's governments over and over, but the salivating beast of democracy is blind to borders and their principles.

Find out why Russia attacked Ukraine. Situated next to Russia Ukraine was allowing Americans & NATO wepons systems NATO troops in to Ukraine and build military capabilities against Russia on its own backyard. For years Russia warned Ukraine not to backstab Russia. After years of ignorant action by Ukraine Russia has the legitimate right to defend its security just like USA did in Afganisthan Pakistan   Many many countries
Enserio … publicidad ? Solo os importa el dinero a todos …
putin the next hitler
I’m embarrassed to be human
China is watching and is probably ready to take Taiwan.
We did it Joe !
The British didn't choose this. Putin did when he invaded a sovereign nation
Including the people of Lugansk and Donetsk  .

If Ukraine wants to join Nato, then they should be allowed. They're a sovereign nation, putin gets no say in that
I mean war never stop. There will always be war between a country
It was all a lie from putin from the start. He's clearly been planning for this for years.
I haven't got any sympathy for the government of UKRAIN as they have been listening to NATO and US but I do feel for the civilians
Natos and USAs Insidejobs  and now media blame Russia
you do not launch the first middle and call it “self defense”…. Putin is a pathetic ex-kgb who was born into, fought in, and articulated war, and that’s all he knows. He needs to be replaced soon
I cry for the ukranian people.
All because a shriveling old man who is losing his physical and mental faculties is desperately trying to return to the past.  Prune faced Putin, there is no turning back the clock.
Stop sending prayers, send heavy weapons to Ukraine so they can waste as much Russian Soldiers as possible. Send them back to Moscow in body bags for Putin to personally count them.
...all of this fault of the U.S.A
Kudos to this Reporter! No western journalists worth a spit there.
Ukraine needs to use 2 empty lanes on other side of highway for leaving Capitol and allow one lane only for entering the city!!
Peace ☮️ ☮️ ☮️ peace on our planet is what we want!
People are already having enough issues to lead  proper lives. Now, this unnecessary war will ruin their lives. War isn’t good for anyone.I like Putin. But, I don’t like his action now.West should also consider Russia’s security concerns. Everyone should think rationally and avoid this madness please.Human race may become extinct if this continues.
I’m glad you put that out there tho about the people
this is meant to distract us.....
Praying for all the innocent civilians in Ukraine🙏🏻❤️❤️ love from the US
You can thank jobkillingjoe and the no balls dummycrats for this wouldn't happen under President Trump.
I think our only hope, what i see nobody else saying...... Is that the Russian people stand up for what is right and put pressure on Putin to do and put things right here. Any military intervention by the rest of the world will be catastrophic and sanctions aint going to work. So there isn't many other options that I see.
Looks like Putin is the new Hitler. World War 3?
its a lesson for the world... those crying foul in corridors of power need understand that things ought to b done for future of humanity instead of few devils ! the veil of dialogue is becoming a shroud of deceit . Rest assure, state sponsored media can no longer hide things,,,truth shall prevail !
Aaa quit spinning crap
LONG LIFE  PUTIN
Fuck them up Russia
Kashmir will be free from indian illegal occupation  ✌✌✌
Esto es ridículo todas las potencias quisieran el control total del planeta, no es sólo Putin, hasta los ciudadanos comunes muchos se creen más que otros ya sea por su raza, condición económica, etc. Pero a la hora de la muerte no hay distinción de nada, igual muere un millonario blanco que un pobre Negro o Hispano. malditas fronteras y maldito petróleo.
I ❤ Ukraine
PIDERAST PUTIN
You people don't respect any person but your propaganda leaders in the west
Is there any of you say anything about Ukrainian’s kill their own people in Donbass? All of you was quiet put their head in the hole.
russian people need to kick that sad heartbroken little man and the rest of his scumbag friends
Im Mexican i live in the mexican-US border and i support The Russian Federation 🇷🇺🇲🇽🇷🇺🇲🇽🇷🇺
Putin really messed up.. Lock him up for life.. Sick sick sicko
Russia is testing the water,and the water is very calm ,I pray the ripple wont become a tsunami.
With Ukraine... Russians are not defending they are now the real nazis
As a fellow human I can care less. I am a real human not a fake one. The real ones dont care. The weak ones are the ones that cares
Damn U.S.A and NATO  looking weak AF..
Ukraine president surrender, stop the death.Better with Russia than against
STOP RUSSIA NOW, the country and their leader must be held accountable, either attacked back or chained down now.
this new streets of tarkov map looks sick !!!
We will NEVER be on Russias side!🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
DENAZIFY - NAZI GVMT run by 2 Jews, Volodymyr Zelenskyy - PM & Volodymyr Groysman, so ABSURD, GO RUSSIA !!!
Can't see Ukrain troops defending as yet ???
The time when british air strike hitted iraqi childrens home,hospital along with american drone,pluster bomb......... In search of world mass destructive weapon....i believe in its existence
ukraine political leaders big mistake... believing western countries...  they didnot learn from syria,libya and iraq... after few weeks western media will forget ukraine same like syria...
The most disgusted you Europe and America these hypocritical people
No one cares about Palestinians , Syrians,  and many more..
I hope the international world will intervene quickly and not allow this mad dictator (Putin) get away with this again? I am praying for the people of Ukraine 🇺🇦 🙏🏽
My grandmother lived through world War 2 my grandfather fought in a war in Madrid in the 50s its not good soldiers are risking they're lives to fight which isn't good either xxxxxxxxxxxx
Hope this ends asap llease keep the Ukranin people safe and in our prayers
The world will stand with Ukraine. Support from the UK 🇬🇧 🇺🇦
Don’t worry Ukrainians, UK got your back we defeated one bully (hitler) we’ll crush another, you’re in our thoughts stay strong 💪 🇬🇧 🇺🇦
My prayers are for ukrain people...
Every Ukrainian must rise up against the Putin Fox.
Save the Ukrainian girls
I am sad for every human being. Can’t we be better than this?
Russian heroic army will win
hope that people are safe. Russia needs to stop its action
and poland 2, we will fight till our win
The only nazi is putin! To say Ukraine is starting it makes to sense they aren’t bombing Russia so how is the Ukraine starting this?
Putin wants to denazify Ukraine by taking the power from its legitimately elected Jewish president?Two bombs one on the Kremlin one on Putin's black sea mansion
UKRAINE WILL LIVE 🇺🇦 ❤️
NATO wake up!  You didn't have a problem bombing Serbia, which never threatened a NATO country.  So stop this bullshit that Ukraine is not a NATO member and so you can't intervene.
Aliens be like this season of earth is fire af 🔥🔥🔥
That's pure terrorism: to attack civil structures and civilians for political and ideological reasons. As simple as that.
Bet the civilian casualties are caused by NATO. Typical NATO operation. Kill innocent then blame the enemies for in front of the public.
Everything was ok until some countries provoked them and left them alone to the destruction.
This is the result of careless expansion of NATO to Russian border for the last 30 years. It is a public knowledge that Putin had been begging the west to stop the expansion and the encircling of Russia. However, all his warnings were ridiculed and the expansion got closer and closer to Russia. Any country, let alone a powerful Russia, has the God given right to defend itself from any threat. The surprising thing should be that why did Russia waited up until it is fully encircled? Better late than never, Russia should demilitarize Ukraine to the point of no future threat. That should be the goal of Russia, not occupying Ukraine. After all, the west has been Gambling on the future of Ukraine for selfish reason of containing Russia. Well, let see if the west save Ukraine now. Ukrainian leaders should have learnt a lesson from the war in Georgia in 2009. No western country will take dangerous risk by facing the Russia military power. It is a fact. Why the Ukrainian leaders do not see this fact? Regardless of how much they hate Russia, common sense should have told them that playing with Russia's security just to make their western boss happy is a dangerous game and a destruction to the state of Ukraine.
With Russia 🙏🏽.
Those don't look like military targets.
Well, I'm game for anyone showing the west their place. There was no need of inviting Ukraine into NATO other than to instigate Russia. The cold war is long over and the soviet union was disintegrated. USA should just accept Russia's demands and call it a day. But they won't because they've massive egos disguised as 
Miss Trump yet?
We Pakistani feel bad for Ukraine. Ukraine leaders choose wrong side and now they facing disaster. Before War you take right decision for your country after War starts no one knows what happened in the end.
Nato useless UN useless
The international community MUST end this. The world owes nothing to Putin. Communism is a plague in the world. This emboldens his buddies, naturally. Watch China take over Taiwan next. Democracy is in peril and only democratic nations can save us. Democratic nations must rise up NOW to fight these beasts or we are fully in WWIII. Except everybody has nukes. Bye, world. It was nice knowing you.
I see a lot people cheers us up in this moment. If anyone wants to support the Ukrainian army, the account number is on the official channel Military Television of Ukraine(Військове телебачення України) Слава Україні.
This is how World Wars started.. 🤦🏻‍♂️
UK and USA slept in but yet went into the Iraq without an excuse god bless Ukraine 🇺🇦
Defensive ! Oh look I just moved my Country WESTWARD !! I am still DEFENDING !! yeah Crazy Putler ... I am defending from UKRAINE by moving INTO UKRAINE .. oh look I AM DEFENDING even MORE FINLAND needs to be LIBERATED ... Ohno Look I am defending ... cause well fine Putler is crazy and attacking :P
God bless the people of Ukraine, the people of Ireland are praying for you.

Putin just (allegedly) invaded Ukraine. At least that’s the narrative the Media has pushed all week long. It feels like the MEDIA invaded Ukraine. But it has allegedly happened this evening and Biden is no where to be found. Trending: President Trump: “We’re Coming Back…Something’s Gonna Happen!”
Wanti g reserect the communist USSR
These brave people who are on camera and defy Putin.. There is hope for Russia!🇺🇦🙏
Hey BRITAIN tell russia to make it fast recovering their ukrain before it destroys the flow of stocks exchange!!!! And say my regard to your monarch 😜
I will support Ukraine 🇺🇦 ❤️ from Jamaica 🇯🇲  & 🇨🇺 cuba ,
Very nice
I thought Soviet union died in 1991
Useless agency WHO, UN now NATO
I don’t understand why this is happening in 2022.
The international community MUST end this. The world owes nothing to Putin. Communism is a plague in the world. This emboldens his buddies, naturally. Watch China take over Taiwan next. Democracy is in peril and only democratic nations can save us. Democratic nations must rise up NOW to fight these beasts or we are fully in WWIII. Except everybody has nukes. Bye, world.

Putin needs to be stopped
I really hope that the russian people sees this for what it is, not listening to their foreverly corrupt government. So sad to wake up to these news.
We as a world need to unite against Russia
@ 5-26 Yes and many recall who was on who's side back then ....
Innocent people are getting hurt

Support for Ukraine and Hoping for peace from the Philippines. 🇵🇭
Please be safe, my heart is bleeding  for Ukraine... Please, not another war, not another horror....
The most biased western media
The Russian ruble and markets are currently crashing and the Russians are in a state of panic, rushing to banks and atm's and that's after just the first wave of sanctions with more to come. Let's keep the pressure going.
Putin still not yet attack newclear when attack newclear what happened nobody think this
it is not easy to live near a big and powerful country.it is effect of Blackhole.
Palestine and Ukraine united for peace 🤝
The West is doing to little the only thing he will understand is real war consequences and should suffer these with a total blockade
Dictator Vladimir Putin's war crimes.
Other countries watching, but not actaully helping, actually pathetic. Just eating bad news and feeding media everything is a circus.
Pray 🙏 for Ukraine 🇺🇦
Innocent people always have to die for incompetent  and greedy leaders all over the world.
The invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan was democratic and right, this one is bad, isn't it?
Where NATO......hahaha 🤣🤣
Its all about Ukraine to understand to be nuteral rather then beating drums with nato thats west people creating unrest in world as how they created in Iraq,  Israel,  sirya, lidiya no point.
Is it just me, but I thought the US was going to step in and help
WW1 started  because of the assassination of a Austrian  leader  ...
damn so anyone gon live stream the battle doe?
Never betray angels who give up nuclear !
Mini Hitler has spoken.
NATO needs to try to take this in hand now
If the West don't help Ukraine. Then Taiwan is doomed..
NATO killed several Chinese citizens 20 years ago. And now doing nothing. Fxcking NATO.
THE U.S. HAS A WEAK STUPID PRESIDENT AND V.P AND RUSSIA AND CHINA AND IRAN KNOW IT - IT'S COMING PEOPLE - GET READY!!!  THE NEWS MEDIA AND DEMOCRATS BY VOTING IN BIDEN GOT US INTO A WORLD OF HURT!!!  GAS UP - FOOD UP - GET READY!!!
Imagine the great achievements of humanity, where now our entire human race is all put to shame once again - by one man: Putin ...
I can’t believe we’re gonna have ww3 over not even 1/3 of Ukraine, someone outta slap putin about for picking such a lame target.
All these people saying they will fight better get a move on.Didn't see anyone at the border when the tanks crossed.
No Human wants war only monsters
Poor people who live in Ukraine who did nothing wrong.
All the war lessons we got and here we are doing the same stupid thing that the stupidest people could pull, I hope Ukrainian turn table around.
Putin is a lier,  he cannot be trusted.
Ukraine did the same mistake that sri lanka did in late 80's. Trusting west too much and turing powerful neighbor (india) to an enimy. When india sent their troops to sri lanka, West turned blind eye on our country. and ukraine is paying the same painful price as sri lanka did. History repeats.
Don't Run. Don't wait for help. Fight for your country & your freedom.
War propaganda
If it says PRESS on the kevlar vest, it is okay to shoot. 😌
that the minds of the Ukrainians do not break in these hard times and that their hearts remain brave and strong in the face of these threats to their territorie
Wow man look at the strategies of Russian army. Within 2 3 days Ukraine will fall
Putin is acting like Adolf a deranged dictator
You can't deny that the Ukrainian government is way too far and there is some merit in wanting it gone. Until yesterday I would have still thought that the west is over reacting and forcing the rhetoric of war onto Russia and Putin...today this looks very different! Putin should be stopped in his tracks right now!
Rip neo-nazi in ukraine...
Joining the British reserves. The world is with you Ukraine.
Love one another. For these times are dark. I pray for all the innocent lives lost and those to be lost in time. Prayers to you all 🙏
Kept peace is the best way n negotiation with Russian President Vladimir Putin is the right time for future generations
I believe putin said he would attack on wensday.
war ... what is it good for ... ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!!  RUSSIA IS DISGUSTING!!!
stand with ukraine
For Mother Russia
Yeah, it's  RUSSIA, it's PUTIN, it's Ukraine, it's all talk and no action by western government because it's not a WEAK Middle Eastern Country like Iran, Iraq, Lybia or Syria, it's NOT Saddam Hussein, Mumar Gaddafi or Bashar Al Assad, and it's NOT a THREAT to ISRAEL, so we can all relax and just about sanctions.
Pray🙏 for Ukraine🇺🇦 ❤
Such a beautiful city.
God bless the people of Ukraine.
Don't get why everyone says to lay down your arms after just a few hours of fighting. Not sure that has worked since Mongolia ruled the world.Good luck Ukraine. Even if you can't win, make the invasion as costly as possible.
NATO and usa  are the real treats to the world.no one will point that...
End putin end war
Now russia is the villan right? Oh come on everything is because usa and nato. Usa is baddest country in the entire planet

@UCYo5NbUUHMuOruTGtFFV6CQ Ukraine did threaten to go nuclear so...Touché
People of Ukraine are the ones that  Russian peacekeepers are there to protect. Eight years they've been suffering by the US planted putsch regime persecutions, ban of one of their national language, shellings, bombing and terror by the US supported Banderastan terrorists. Now the ones that suffered all those years are finally rejoicing for there never been that much sense of freedom and security in sight since the US warmongering regime meddling in 2013.

Kill the head of the snake. Aim for Putin. End this war fast.
So when do we in the west star rounding up Russians living in our country? If we are going to be at war can we trust them,?
Praying for Ukraine from the United Kingdom x
Crazy Putin 🤯
Stupid Zelensky!! Your stupid act caused innocence life suffering.
If this is how he treats his (one people) why the fuck do the Russian people sit back and allow it. What a disgrace
NATO been asking for it, and now here it is y'all playing the victim card. Smh
The problem is neither Ukraine not Russia the problem for Nato which is a problem making terrorist organization and this same organization is using Ukrainian as battle ground against Russia
Stallin feared Potton.Putin should fear Biden but history will repeat it self.Good leaders come into play when the rich want it.Biden is bring down the US its a plan and there's nothing the American people can do about it.Yet
Russia
For days I been saying...let's gooooo.Now I can say kaboooooom
In Russia they can get anyone killed by poisoning and assassinating. How Come that this nazi criminal is still alive? Kill it and peace will follow.
No Amount of prayer will stop this. Putin must be stopped. 🇺🇦🇸🇬
world war III starts when other countries joined
Wonderful. .
Good advice
“Peace keeping”
May Allah save innocent Ukraine 🇺🇦 people. Amen! 🤲🏻
I don't see any bombs falling on kyve, so it looks like extrem restraint being used.  If your calmly talking on the street, your , well, count your blessings.
India also need to invade pakistan for Kashmir
We need to remember this, that the Russian people are not happy about this....it's not Russians we are to blame but only one man's ambition and delusions of Granduer - Vladimir Putin who wants to be the new Russian Czar
Jesus. Why why why?
Praying for Ukraine from India🇮🇳
How is that dumb ass trying to bull shit . Everyone knows Putin is a kgb monster.
Israel did the same thing to Palestine. Now I know how it feels as Media wasn’t reporting Isreal aggression. Why wasn’t the world reacting same for Palestine??
This is horrible! So so sad. The devil is at work. Putin is evil.
I am not American , nor Russsian , nor from Ukrain too but I follow one thing that how news change from country to country , nation to nation.
When the Ukrainian is speaking who is the we he is referring to this will make clear the stake the UK and USA have in Ukraine
How about we just nuke Russia, China and North Korea and eliminate them from the map forever..
You need to denazify Russia
We need mass protest all around world against this violence.

Why would NATO step in and protect another eastern block country that is unstable ! It’s not the UK’s war ! Get on with it !
So incredibly angled media.. for sure there are people supporting both sides of the coin and its a shame the media doesnt show this. This shows the media cant be trusted
Like your idea
Everybody is 
👆77th brigade sock-puppet trolls and bots!👇
Why western media didn't report the wars when nato and us invaded Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen and other countries?
How coward Putin’s government is, so no one can protest against his stupid decisions? He loves to put people in jail if is not on his side, shame on him!
Thinking of Ukraine in these dark times! From UK 🙌
Prayers for Ukraine… I am so sorry you are going through this ❣️…
This is not horrible this is the same what USA army has been doing in diferent countries like lrak and afganistan; USA destroyed all these countries and nobody said anything; l dont see any problem with this war because Russia  is protecting its own society, language and leadership in this part of europe, So l suggest USA doesnt  do anything because they have been doing the same and even they are telling just lies about russia, being honest Russia  is a country who hasn't caused problems but  yes USA does
Where is America NATO EU big big talk and warning to Russia but in  Real can't do anything look the world is watching
Where is the Ukrainian military?so they just let them drive right in and start Fukin shit up?
Who will stand up for the Ukrainians?👂👀👂
Go Putin! Kill these traitors.
reminds me of american cod, talk by video and attack , any idea where are those sniper camper hiding in ukraine ,lol
Russia loves you
At a time when we need peace the most, the exact opposite is happening… my heart breaks for the civilians. God bless Ukraine 🇺🇦
So much for the UN a organisation with no teeth.
YOU STAND WITH UKRAINE , I STAND WITH RUSSIA ,ITS OUR TERRITORY AND WE ARE ONLY TAKING IT BACK  ,WE ARE NOT TARGETING THE CIVILIANS ,ONLY MILITARY BASES,   UKRAINE WAS NOT MORE OF  A  PUPPET TO THE WESTERN WORLD ,WELL IT FORGOT WHO WAS HIS FATHER ,SO WE NEED TO SHOW HIM HIS PLACE .#WARISGOOD.

 @Anime Mega Bucket  and which god is that? The one that flooded the Earth?
The US is still involved in like 293 wars around the world and has been for the last ten years. This is just another drop in the bucket of conflicts.
This is so sad
ok lets go easy>soft take down>
For 22 years we have known Putin was crazy with a mad man's plan. Where were the West? Lalalalalallalalalalal... not listening.... lalalallalalal.... fingers in ears...... lalalalalall...Pathetic. The West couldn't/wouldn't look at and see the madman. Why have the Tories reduced defence funding for years? Send the British army to Estonia. Mobilise reserves. Immediately. Stop being cowards. Defend Ukraine with what Putin only respects. Military force.
The first defence with Javelin results in kill of 15 tanks.
What a lunatic!
So here's a couple of questions I think that journalists have to ask;How many people have to die before the west starts on the sanctions?rIsn't prevention better than consequence?Why didn't they have the sanctions ready from the moment Russia started the invasion?Why do they have to find out NOW what to do?
Ukraine is about to go dark re news coverage. Spot the thermobaric missiles moving in and the private relief of many politicians (hello bozo) that this provides a convenient external scapegoat/  distractionn.A bloodbath is coming.
European countries are silent and  do nothing
Damn right!!! Don't try to bully the Russian federation!!!!
can't believe this kind of thing still happened in  2022. Putin  still lived in the last century
May god save you all, love from Malaysia.
RUSSIA <3
Yet again history repeats itself, how is it mankind has to fight each other. This world with never see peace until we are all gone...
#ZombieStalinism at work in the psychotic belligerence of Putin - the criminal butcher of unarmed civilians in Chechnya and user of banned weapons, an imperialism completely devoid of humanity, global responsibility and peace. #IStandWithUkraine
NATO have no balls to step into ukraine, US army now face their biggest enemy and not some arabian dessert militan...
Puttin pls understand pak and chain is the real beneficiary of this war ( i am a Roman catholic from India we wish peace for the all (not fighting together for a single a litte bit of land (believe God give us everything pls people not spoil destroy that gift of God
If the West is against annexation, why aren't we sanctioning Israel ( now finally recognised as an Apartheid State by Amnesty International)? If we're against illegal wars, why are we supplying bombs to Saudi Arabia? If we oppose brutal dictators, why are we training the military of Cameroon? Incredible double-standards from Britain and America. BBC coverage of this is like CBC coverage of the Truckers. Imagine even 1 Russian base along the American border?? Russia has been unbelievably patient with the steady advancement of NATO aggression.
Someone just needs to take Putin out at this point.
glory to russia!
You mean whte people history
Self defense.     Same as USA strike Syria  on self defense!         What a history book we an Do now !
And all the dopey BBC bang n about is white privalige blah blah blah, really hope the BBC will soon be disbanded
We need to send f-22s to secure Ukraines air space!
I stand with Putin because his claim is valid!
Not many images coming out alot of talk not very convincing at all
Stay strong Ukrainian people, continue standing tall and proud. Love from Kurdistan ♥️
It's the destruction of Europe,like world war l and world war ll.American government policy; 'Divided and Rule'
stop hustle don't fight the war
Ukrainian are like toys between two superpowers
Ukraine did not want to implement the Minsk agreements. The Ukrainian government set up by the West did not guarantee any rights to the Russians who have always lived in Ukraine. Putin could no longer watch the genocide of his people. The Ukrainian army is full of neo-Nazis. The Russians lost 24 million people in ww2, do you really think they will allow neo-Nazis from Ukraine to kill Russians again.
Self defense of What?
How many casualties?
We are in the end times. This war will spread to the America and other parts of the world, (we will be invaded and we wont win). The only refuge will be in Jesus Christ, repent and receive Him while you are able.
Putin feeling threatened is like the USA worrying about Rhode Island
Oh my god!I´m watching from Portugal...This is insane!!!This guy is The russian Hitler!My prayers go to Ukrainian people and soldiers!
Fuck Russia 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿

Almighty's Grace nothing else dear from the Special Day Video of Day 1.
Russia feel threatened from Ukraine? Impossible. Not logic
Putin is evil, to start a war like this while the world is reeling from a pandemic and there is environmental and financial turmoil everywhere. War and violence are never the right answer!!! The innocent people of Ukraine do not deserve this. No one deserves this. Please stay strong, Ukraine! We can't tell you whether to flee or fight, but our hearts and prayers are with you. All sisters and brothers of one earth. The planet mourns this needless suffering.
fight for your country how retarded can a person be

No war 😭😭😭😭💔💔💔 no warrr
The people in Russia are all mixed up just like the end times in the Bible talks about they are all mixed up some know exactly what's going on and other ones believe both is doing it right and on and on and on just like we are in America because of Putin and Trump if he wants to do some denazification then he ought to come here because them motherfukers are all over the place Putin's a liar Trump is a liar the Republican party or a bunch of liars and now half of that country are all confused and completely mixed up Citroen plovers I should say even some of the religious people they don't like Biden because they don't like abortion so they vote for a goon and orange baboon's ass or face that's lied about everything all for the greed of money and power just like the whole Nazis the freaking proud boys the freaking Oath Keepers Boogaloo boys and on and on and on only thing I know I'm not against abortion because this is supposed to be a free country if it depends on a woman's life to live or die she should have the right to decide if a child becomes pregnant because of a stepfather or blood father impregnate in her at 9 or 10 or 11 or 12 years old it's disgusting and the Republicans are saying that she needs to keep the baby God himself is going to judge this world stay tuned for that real-life video folks talk about death and destruction because of people being so mixed up there will be billions of people laying in the streets Powers will fall all around the world at all of the tall huge Towers will fall Mountains will be moved by God it is done and he sends his son back to Earth
Putin is a Fox and bad dog.
They battle to contain fires in residential buildings that have been hit by rockets. Putin telling the people of Ukraine that they are not a target, and they will only target military infrastructure was clearly another lie then. He has no regard for human life, and does not care how many people, including his own, have to die needlessly over something as ridiculous as this.
Face the Russia, NATO and Biden so pussy
Prayers wont help!  Some Agreements must be Violated so that NATO Can Help Ukraine Militarily and crush the Russian invasion It should not escalate to a nuclear war I hope! If not, without the support from China, Putin wont have many allies thus losing the conflict,
I am not involved in this but looking at it from the outside I;d say this is a tragedy
Its like we all watching this but can't do anything
Why can’t NATO work with Russia to assure the latter that NATO will not expand toward former Soviet territories? You are putting your missiles at the doorstep of someone, pointing at them and yet call them the aggressor? Where is the common sense? If this continues, I will not be surprise that Russia will expand toward NATO too to safeguard her own security - may be put some missiles at Cuba, Venezuela, etc?
This is what happens when you have weak and pathetic western leaders.
Bugger!
Why can’t both the USA and Russia medle with the wishes of the Ukrainian people and their way of living.?

BREAKING NEWS!!! BREAKING NEWS!!! The Crazy MadMan of Moscow the honourable Putin, just could not stay home and now he is scattering his penis enhancers all over his scary Free and Democratic neighbor!!!r!!! !!!rEarlier the Crazy Man has promised that he will invade Ukraine. Rah, Rah. Jolly Good. Cheer him on, Cheer him on!! (It is an act of self-preservation to cheer on a Crazy Man.)r . rThe Crazy Man always holds all the cards. Hey, Putin, good buddy. You are just a cowardly age-demented old man wildly holding a really, really big gun. We all know that your little gun has a jammed chamber and a shrinking barrel. Look, Putin, you are such a coward that you sent your Foreign Minister out to bravely wave the Megaton Flag. Really... You could not hold that pole up yourself?  Problems often come in pairs. Wait, I am being unkind, Vlad, you finally found the strength to lift your own Megaton Flagpole... Still a bit short. Go ahead little boy, nuke a couple of cities, that's a good boy. You know, Moscow and Novosibirsk are looking terribly pale. They both could use a deep tanning that would really brighten them up. (Gratuitously written to give my good buddy, Putin's, Cyber Thugs something to write home about.) (ps... Hey, Vladdy-Buddy, Fear not... I am not ignoring you. Yes, Yes... You are pulling some troops and tanks away from the border. Doubters would lie about this by claiming that these are merely normal attack troop rotations and tank maintenance rotations, but what do those fools really know? I believe you, my friend, They are unaware of your... well, emotional... problems. This Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder that affl...  annoys you. This thing where you make a new, better assertion but it still takes months to make it happen. Let's be honest. You have already made your decision to ru... oops! pull away (curse the finger tripping) from Ukraine but your damn OCD will let months slip away before the troops really move. Vlad, you have my full support. You can do this. I am guarding your six o'clock. I will fight off the naysayers.)
Remove can’t
Both the Russia America Should stop their involvement in the internal affairs of Ukrainian people
This is not self defense this is murder
It’s a matter of opinion, the US has been invading countries all over the world in order to protect the security of blah blah blah…. This isn’t any different, Russia see NATO as a threat, so don’t want NATO or their missiles on their doorstep, seems kind of understandable from Russia’s perspective, imagine if Cuba decided to strike up a similar deal with the US…..you think the US would allow that to happen?
Unbelievable that they've been left to fend for themselves. The West is so weak. It's the 1930s all over again when no one wanted to fight Germany and just kept letting it get worse until the fight came anyway under worse conditions. Absolutely shameful, toothless leadership.
This is a bit much for self defense.Still wondering exactly what the Kyiv regime did to deserve this.
Seek The Lord while He may yet be found.
🇺🇦 ❤ be strong from 🇬🇧
EU cannot live with RUSSIA and Russia should demiltarilise so lay down your arms while NATO invades.. F who the F writes Putin speeches .. Sounds ridiculous doesn't it , but HE SAID IT ! crazy Putler...
Well done Putin
Wait✋ Putin called this attack self defense?? Since when is launching an attack UNPROVOKED self defense???😡😡😡 He is showing his insanity to the entire world.
This is horrible and inhumane. My prayer goes out to the Ukrainian people.
Where is the NATO???
All for Putin's ego and fear of democracy.
Both country civilians don't want war, but damn leaders are smashing, if they want battle they should go  one on one
Bomb the hell out of Belarus!
As much as I knew Putin would do this, it's still unbelievable. Our hearts go out to all the Ukrainians.
Peace ☮️ Please
This isn't a war this is Russia lobbing missiles at apartment buildings and airports
Yeah... It came as no surprise, but still shocking. It was building up for years... It wasn't what if.... It was when....

It's even worse that most of the Russian citizens don't want to start a war, it's only Putin and his little men.

May god protect both sides. War is hell.
Stop believing right wing propaganda. They said that we were overreacting for weeks and months. Here we are. Fuck off!
So WHY is Biden begging for DIRTY OIL  from RUSSIA while they are INVADING UKRAINE???? How can SANCTIONS work if we are buying their oil?? Why are we buying RUSSIAN oil if we are energy independent??? Is Hunter Biden still in Ukraine? STOP VOTING FOR LIBERALS!
So, they had  no clue about shit in Afghanistan, 
This sad day Putin is pure evil!
Enough is Enough. These politicians are screwing up the world.
Putin (as well as his little buddy Trump) are all about small 🍄 energy!!!
This would NOT have happened if Trump was still there. But political correctness had to oust him in 4 years of nonstop mainstream media bombardment to turn public opinion against him. You fight our upstanding men in your woke fight against 
Russia is just acting like a bully. Stay strong Ukrainians ✊️ From Bangladesh 🇧🇩
Cut off Russia from natural resources until they learn their lesson ….all Allias defeat this bully..Putin is awakening a sleeping giant 1000 fold
America/Nato interfere too much in the affairs of other countries, under the pretext of maintaining peace, the proof is that in the Middle East they are fighting each other, they come as if they are heroes of peace, Iraq is accused of having nuclear power, the president is executed and then for the new president, America has prepared it, continues to mine oil. Where is it going, the same thing was done in Afghanistan, now how many years ago they arrived in Syria even though the official government did not invite them, then patrolled the Syrian oil mines, I'm sure all countries know that but are silent because they are afraid of being punished by America, I emphasize not all stupid as you imagine hey america, now meet the one who has the nuclear meet the balanced opponent invites Nato your gang is nothing more than a loser,
This is senseless
Slavs, you have been fighting infighting for centuries, haven't you reacted? Either Yugoslavia was beaten, or the West Slavs beat the East Slavs, and now the East Slavs beat the East Slavs. You can't unite and be smart.
Besides  the loss of lives , i heavily admire what Putin did  to show its presence to stop US hegemony in Asia
He will have Ukraine and lose all he has including his life.
Putin is a criminal. Stop him and his ass lickers
So where is the american now?
This is really heartbreaking,Stay strong for Ukrainian people🙏
Chills coming down to my spines as I see these poor civilians leaving their hometown because of others stupidity. My heart and prayers to Ukraine from Philippines❤️
Ukrainian Military was part of NATO Led occupation forces in Afghanistan. What goes around, comes around.
“We Fought The Wrong Enemy.” History is Repeating itself right in front of our eyes.
Let's have worldwar3 too then Russia🇳🇱
What moral authority does US have to denounce Russia? I mean USA is the father of invasions. They bombed Libya out of UN mandate, destroyed Iraq under false pretences, looted Afghanistan, & the list never stops... AND NOW JOE TALKS OF PEACE, STABILITY & RESPECTING SOVEREIGNTY. You gotta be kidding me.
Worldstarrrrrr
This spineless US president is useless. The way US left afganistan showed the world that he is weak, and Putin took the advantage of this of his weakness. Useless superpower country with a useless president.
This is unthinkable! for just a one person to judge the fate of Ukrainian people. Why we could not let them live in peace. This a Pretext for WW3. Tsk. tsk..
All this because loosing so many people to covid wasn't enough.! He's a war munger
Ukraine needs our airforce. We the US needs to deploy our airforce over ukraine
Who cares? These same war mongerers are responsible for uncountable war crimes and murders on children and women, they f*** the whole of the Middle East and Africa, and now they want us to sympathise with their little personal beef F*** THAT! I’m still screaming free Palestine 🇵🇸
Putin had no plans to invade but Zelensky increased genocide on Donbass. Ukraine asked for the take over.
Meanwhile the west debates blocking Russian iPhone sales..

The world should be love and peace and only destroy violent people. If people are gonna start wars they should be completely wiped off the map so everyone can get back to having peace. Gonna have to fight fire with fire I guess. Bomb Russia and get it over with so you can give them Ukraine people peace and people in Russia, stand up to your government, your government is gonna get your whole country Nuked.
I love Putin ….
The western leaders negotiated with Ukraine to give up their nuclear weapons with a promise to be there for them in a time of need. Hmmmm. Why is the major media not bringing this to the forefront of the news coverage? Are truly sanctions enough aid to cover the promises made or do we just have weak leaders?

Americans stand with Ukrainian people.
Hoping for Ukraine and all its people to be safe
I'm for a war declaration on Russia, who is with me?
God Bless President Putin 🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
USA is meddlesome, Ukrainian govt. is very foolish by being enemy with the neighbors
where is the air defense? why are they waiting? this is nonsense. it sounds like a coup supported by russians and internal allies. this should end fast.
Good move from the Kremlin...to get rid the minority fascist and elites who plundering the country into chaos
God Bless You Ukraine, 🇵🇱🤝🇺🇦
When Nato put army near Russia nobody want to here what Russia has to say. Russia have warning and warning Nato , but Nato didint listen last 20 years.  Why everyone is so suprised?  Everybody was silent when Nato attack Yugoslavia....  I had 11 years when nato airplane fly just above my house in 1999.
Shame on russia and the russian people for letting this happen

THIS IS THE PROBLEM OF TOO MANY WOMEN AND TOO MANY BOYS RAISED BY SINGLE MOTHERS VOTING.REAL MEN KNOW YOU PREPARE FOR WAR AND NOT SPEND MONEY SO WOMEN DON'T NEED A HUSBAND. Marriage & children are the backbone of a country.   Something FEMINISTS fought against. This never happened under Trump because Putin knew Trump would make his life hell.  BOYS learn you get hurtwhen you play fight so you learn to talk out your problems.  Playing team games we learn how to work with other boysto WIN.  If not for the RUSSIAN LIES ABOUT TRUMP would Russia be OUR ALLY and not Chinas?    Give Russia the Crimea but pull out and move all Russian speaking Ukrainians there.   The rest of Ukraine would have been UNIFIED with a Ukrainian  population. If Russia had free trade with the West we would both be safer AND RICHER.
Let's war 💀 nice
support Ukraine because i hate Russia🏳️‍🌈
The Ukraine army will fall under Russian pressure. Better to take the uniform off and follow the example of Afghan. Hit and run, wear them down sending bags home. When the Russian people see bombs on their own land people will act. It seem the new norm in modern warfare. The Russians families will soon get angry at their own leaders and no one will win in the end.
Classic fascist Russia. Blood and soil justification. And his audacity to call Ukraine nazis when the Russian military is full of nazis, their president is a clear fascist, pay Russian militia leaders with ss tattoos, and openly support every right-wing government under the sun.
putin wants ukraine to disable its military capabilities. its like asking another country not to have armed forces at all to defend itself. after this he could do so with every country he is paranoid with.
Regardless of who is on whose side and what sympathies he has, this is aggression. No choir. But ...Do not forget that 2012 is the year. David Cameron stated that Ukraine has a place in the EU, but before that, it should provide Ukraine with NATO membership. When the then pro-EU government said that this would be possible, you have a statement from the Minister of Defense of the United Kingdom, Philip Hammond, that the port in Sevastopol will be a 
We do not feel safe as per Putin.  The Rus military has basically crippled Ukraine's defenses in hours.
reminds me exactly of the US and NATO attack on Iraq while i was a little one.. while this very channel sugarcoated it all! superpowers just can’t be trusted😭.. I’m almost sure these big powers were well briefed and probably approved of this Russia’s attack, just like they share bombings in Syria.. praying and sobbing for us innocent civilians, having to face this everywhere
That woman is really kidding herself Ukraine won't surrender.
That is all Zelensky's fault. Had he not made himself a puppet of NATO and the US, Ukrainians would have been living peacefully. The Euromaidan rally that put him in power was actually funded by the US.
Nuclear war is up and comingg

Russia will only strike 'military targets' ......which include airports and residential apt Buildings?!?  I call Bullshite on those claims!
Fake news
This airport was often used by the military.
When your government says stay at home and don’t  panic. That is the right time to leave that place and go as far away as you can
I would say the President would fear for his life, not his job!
Good for Putin. He is standing up to the new world order.
You can only poke a bear so long before it attacks you. That’s what the west has done to Russia from overthrow a elected president and install a west leaning puppet. They have done it all over the world for all of my 42 years. They paint putin as this dictator who wants to eat up all of Eastern Europe. Lol. He just wants secure borders for his people against a nato who wants a border with Russia for some weird reason.
The New Hitler
Prayers are all well and good.Arms shipments to Ukraine are good too as well as heavy sanctions on Russia and on the criminal Putin and his family.A hefty increase in US defense spending is in order as well.Let the body bags flow back to Moscow so that the Russian people fully understand the costs of Putin's aggression
WTF do they not know what WW3 WILLdo on OUR planet with todays weapons?  WAKE UP PEOPLE!!!!😎👌
SAD look what this world created WEAPONS 2 Hurt each other....
How to translate Russian: When a Russian says something, always assume they mean the opposite.When Russia said in 2014 
Best if Ukraine surrenders immediately. There's only going to be 1 victor in an all out war, and there's zero use in sacrificing young working men. The west cannot intervene because of the obvious nuclear deterrent. Get it over with and avoid futile bloodshed. Russian annexation is inevitable for Ukraine.
I wonder what happens tho if Nato puts troops in Ukraine does Russia attack them?Russia shouldn't attack civilians
I have a question why the world isnt helping or doing anything about it other than being passive?? Like what are u guys doing sitting at home and watching in tv ?
Heart for the Ukraine
Looks like putin is doing a gaddafi on zelenski.
Time for NATO and the free world to invade Russia. Russia needs to fall!
battlefield X coming soon
And you heard it the other day....TRUMP IS CHEERLEADING PUTIN & RUSSIA
Each and every Country should stop doing any sort of trade or business with them .. this is not right .. also at the moment I think Ukraine should say we won't join nato  sake of their civilian. Put your head down and try make this work in the table .
NATO & UN are useless. Don't expect help from them.
Love to see west suffered like middle east. Thank u putin
Long-live Russia, death to Zionist-imperialism in Ukraine.
go Russia! For the safety of the country, the NATO and US bullies are unacceptable
F*CK RUSSIA AND F*CK PUTIN
Oh good god.....
That man Putin is the literally definition of a devil
This is what is happening everyday in Congo🇨🇩 where more than 8 millions innocent Congolese have now died due to our numerous natural resources - include coltan as the backbone of all electric vehicles, laptops and mobile phones, uranium, gold, diamonds, cobalt, zinc, petrol, and Tangsten which produces x-rays and gama rays - and no one cares, alas! The world will never be the best place to live again until another system (other than capitalism and so-called communism) is implemented and the barter exchange is restored. One world one love❤️
Nerf miner
And he didn't poison the people in Salisbury. Putin is a bigger liar than Johnson, but only just.
Ukrainian president in fear for his job? I’m going to go out on a limb and say he probably has greater fears than just his job.
Putin rot in hell
This Zelenskyy who is hiding in his own room doesn't care about Life of Ukrainians people all he cares about is his stomach ! so sad to risk life of others for your own greediness
Russian Tanks Helicopters are being destroyed all over Ukraine the Javelin Stinger missiles are doing a great Job today . https://youtube.com/shorts/dDkS5tGZke0?feature=share
He truly is a genius
Usa doesn’t support ukraine
Marauders and thieves, of course it is for Ukraine. How else will Great Britain be able to feed you people if there is nowhere to rob?
God save Ukraine. Pray for Ukaine.We love the peace, not violence.From Thailand.
Concludehttps://youtu.be/I7RK0daehRU
To you all sending prayers, get real. If everyone relied on them, we'd get nowhere in this world.It might be kind to say but it won't help
This is horrible! Sending prayers to all Ukrainians. 🙏🙏🙏
Fuck the west ...and you re last of roman empire youre all in sin....you re shame ..... Youre not people seell yours ideologie somhwere ...always west  problem in other house....move on and go to hell...love to Putin and truth
I’m not saying I agree with him or support them but he done make a smart move and it’s a message to all of us.
Heil putinhead!
Calling Ukrainian people nazis wtf?
Putin has now completed the phase of becoming super villain. No one is gonna gain anything from this invasion neither Russia nor Ukraine.
Putin needs to be taken out like the rabid dog he is., did we learn nothing from the past when the free world had to battle hitler
Nato eu and usa war monger countries
Just like the people of Afghanistan, trusting Americans and their subservient NATO footman will be the worse disgrace for the people of Ukraine!
I’m embarrassed to be an American this day. The bought and paid for government we have needs to be gutted and corrupt hanged in public. Start new or die. I think this rings true across the world. The rich have successfully controlled the masses. If you watch most ANY “news” you are being programmed and indoctrination. The more you watch tv the dumber you are to the real world. Lies become truth if told enough and most have become stupid.
Why is USA & NATO messing around with other people's countries using them to play against another country . Zelensky should understand not F around with a world power.
Putin days are counted
Is Putin more like Stalin or Hitler comment down below.
Welcome to the Third World War. Best of luck.
Ukrainians must fight now more than ever make sure their invasion comes at a great cost
You led Ukraine to believe that you'll fight with them against the Russian Army...where are you NATO?? Where are EU??You sponsored the Maidan Square fiasco now we're here reading the last chapter of the book you edited.Let's all pray for the Ukranian civilians.
Blame NATO for pushing closer to Russia. Funny that nobody talks about that.
Quran 2:11And when it is said to them, Do not make mischief in the land, they say: We are but peace-makers.
Keep voting Demoncrat, see what you get. All the problems of the world!!!!
Is putin crazy now?? What is self defense? It is an aggression, idiot
Christian vs Christian 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
As Ukraine is not in NATO, they cannot intervene and Russia knew this.
Without NATO's help Ukraine will be lost you ignorant fuck
 @alexmini123  But it is precisely because NATO Ukraine is in this situation.More weapons will only make Ukrainians lives more miserable!After watching what they did in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, Yemen, Somalia and Yugoslavia I would never trust this people!The Ukrainians did and are paying the heaviest of the prices!
 @alexmini123  
Not really. Most of the Russians are in support of the war and it's approval rate is very high. Also they have enough nukes to blow the planet.
 @Rahul Basak  Wait and see. My guess NATO goes in after a while.
 @Morgan Eriksson  every one knew that nato was leading to Ukraine to war with Russia, still they didn't intervene because of diplomatic relationship with Russia thus I don't see any way how they will intervene now. And it's been strategically happening since last 6 years and the news of the war almost confirmed year NATO kept quiet. Now nothing can happen.
 @Rahul Basak  wait and see ! This is a very sencitive thing fore the world. NATO going in if Ukrainian nation get hurted to much. Ukrainiens going to damage Russian arme very much with support self defence wapons from the world. If that doesent help Nato goes in cause sencitive thing. Feels like they are the same as us. And west oppinien going to force NATO clean up dictator
Or blame Russia, for literally invading Ukraine in full scale.
Putin might take some ground, but will not hold it for long.
Really sad for Ukraine but if NATO mind there own business there will be no war. It’s all there fault.
Putin is Hitler’s son
What a time to be alive, 21st century hitler we have

looks like a US invasion
Those residential buildings look fake lol.
Russians say that eastern Ukraine is full of Nazis. When in fact the Soviets were more brutal and murderous then Nazis back during World War II. As close Ukrainians who were there. Ask them what it was like. And ask them about the same separatist who would murder you for a shovel and betray you to the authorities just so they can take over your land
Praying 🙏 for Ukraine
The poor people of Ukraine :( I'm so sorry this is happening to you guys
Ukraine has never and will never be a threat to the soviet union its all about water
Stand firmly with Ukraine and praying for Ukrainian civilians, soldiers and volunteers from Burma. Your bravery will not be forgotten.
Защитите себя Украина,Весь мир вас поддерживает.Обращение к русским....Русские всех стран,наведите порядок с этим бешеным путином

I hate US media so one sided
Fight back
Stay strong Ukraine! 🇨🇿🤝🇺🇦❤️
Omg putin please stop this nonsense war For God sake😭😭😭 lot of people suffer give peace a chance to reign
People in Palestine experienced this everyday, nobody cares... Because Israel was EU and US most beloved people
HE       Putin is telling you his issues       why won't the Eu and Nato listen?   OUR leaders can't ever negotiate  and reach understanding about anything        put us all at risk for nothing

nop I did>and gave a 2 year warning>
As a human of the world,my heart goes to the Russia people 💕
Putin should really think about what will happen in the end. Only the deaths of people will result.
😢🤯😱😱😱
Protests end like this everywhere now.
Smh...Is this act really necessary?
Military Airport you mean
He said withdrew, he said sending peace keeping troops. N he invaded, he targets not just Frontline,  Evil regime is evil regime , liar is liar. How much longer the democracies finally stand up firmly against the liars,  the evil?
Why is Ukraine not fighting back?
Planned decades ago.. freemasonic new world order
Never trust the mof west
because a JU coup.......is 
Man wtf. Fuck Russia. This not how the world is supposed to go man. This is not right. Y’all killing innocent people.
all this is so funny 🤣
Funny how the liberals kept saying trump would start ww3 but it never happened. 1 year under biden and we are on the verge of a world war. Bidens weakness is the cause of this. Hate to say we told ya so but we did.
The beginning of world war 3 and the new world order.... This has been already predicted 1400 years ago by the greatest man (prophet muhammad (saw))
The Americans will fight Russia until the last European!
NATO and Biden have to do something instead of sitting in their offices and put some sanctions ONLY do some real help of Ukraine
Never give up Ukraine,, we are with you 🇮🇳💥👍
wrold must come together and remove russia from the face of the earth
How all the world leaders are just looking till date with out taking any steps to stop this terrible and incredible invasion???.
Nato and allied western leaders are useless and hopeless.
Why didn't they mention that it targeted the military airport not a civilian airport
The United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union want a war between Russia and Ukraine. No matter how much damage it may cause to Ukraine and Russia, it won't hurt them. But they are sitting in a fool's paradise. Only Ukraine and NATO members will be affected by this war. Russia and China are going to benefit the most.
Make love, not war...God bless Ukraine, Russia....
WW3 baby
Ukraine, Poland and Finland should surrender now to Russia! Or be put in labor camps. Russia #1. We will take over world
Shame on civilized people, nation!!! This is just destruction with no outcome!!

pray and big support for innocent civilians of Ukraine 🇺🇦 from 🇵🇰🥺
Stay safe people of Ukraine lots of love from Ireland
Trauma of WORLD WAR II doesn't stop this mad man.
In your face NATO! Decades of NATO no-fly zones over other people's countries? Now a no-fly zone where NATO wants to fly! Newton's law.
Whats mean a civillians lifes for Puttin? He dont have a test. He is antichrist. But will pay hardestle for hes creazly.
https://youtu.be/fy910FG46C4
I still don't understand, what's the point of this Putin?
Putinhead gamed the world’s capitalists again by borrowing money at high interest rates and then hoping to repudiate his debt by being removed from the SWIFT system. You deal with a criminal you get burned by the criminal. Capitalists rarely make a long-term bet. There is no way for the Ukrainian people to win this. Either live under Putin’s thumb or see their country turned to rubble. What putinhead fears most is a warm water liquid natural gas terminal that could supply Europe with western natural gas. This was all a done deal between Adolph putinhead and agolf twtiler the treasonous traitor while they were in Finland together for their secret meeting. putinhead is gaming Wall Street again and making his short positions good. adolph putinhead might end up with the Ukraine and their natural resources as well.
🇺🇦 people fight against communism 👍🏻🤛🏻🦾
Nato illegally intervene
Russia did not want to war, but Ukraine did colossal mistakes in many ways because the Ukraine government understood the USA and NATO will protect them. In reality, The USA and NATO do not work in this vital time. In addition, all casualties and damages liability goes to the USA, NATO, and unskilled Ukraine government.

American led west is a failure.May be this time Americans and their subservient NATO footman will learn not to underestimate Vladimir Putin!
What hurts me the most is how all this we are fighting for is all going to be for nothing one day.
Just couldn't belive  that no one can stop this!
God always destroy communist countries .
愿世界和平。Wish the world to be peaceful 🙏
Putin had make mistake
I think it is PUTIN now is NAZI on this WAR.
ya ampun,,,, lek Putin lagi ngopo sih
Did any British people want the Iraq war?
Russia does not feel safe with Ukraine so they attack. Now,  the whole world does not feel safe with Russia. gg idiots.
How dare he use innocent people as collateral damage to 'protect' his country.  Worse, blame everyone else for it. Talk about gaslighting.
Canada is with Ukraine 🇺🇦 🇨🇦 Russian and Ukrainian people do NOT want this
We're are the ukrainian military on the frontline how did the Russia military tanks get in to ukraine borders
Sadly earth just needs a break from all of us, she's been trying
And so WW2 BEGINS. This is fucked up. Clearly not an attack. It was clearly a peacekeeping bomb.....dont worry.Sarcasm if you can't tell.
Господа, никогда не воюйте с русскими. Никогда и ни при каких обстоятельствах. Русские отважные воины и они никого не боятся. Для этих русских смерти нет.
I can't believe it the whole eruop can't fight Russia?? My heart goes out for the people of Ukraine. God 🙏 you all safe.
God save Ukraine
💙💛
Let's go.. dig in and set 1000s of massive  remote ied,s dig in wait and make them pay in blood for every inch.. you have the right to defend your country..

What’s wrong with this stupid old man. 🤦🏽Putin. 🤦🏽🤦🏽 . So sad 😭
Pray for 🇺🇦 in South korea..Maybe this could be the future of our country if we don't prepare..
Prayers for Ukrainian people God protect them from the old evil person Putin 🙏😈
Yea the comment section all say pray for Ukraine, but basically you just go on with your life just like sanction, you only can sanction but you can’t do anything to help them.
As a Filipino I blame Biden, trump showed leadership now americas gov. Is woke A.F.
May God bless and protect the Ukrainian people fighting for their liberty against that Russian tyrant!
Украинцы ебаште их самолеты из стингеров
More needs to be done than praying for ukraine. Stay strong ukraine
Why why .. we Europeans/ Americans are great people but the Slavic people are one of the most correct and well behaved people in the world but politics is creating war in their zones .. the people living there are the most quite and peaceful on earth… enough of these scumbags politician
This is all BS, media propaganda.
Ha Fake News the worst is yet to come Xi backed Putin will push their Gas Pipelines through to Europe where Germany relies on 75% of their oil from Russia???   smh Biden shut down the Worlds number one exporter of oil causing this senseless Bloodshed.   Blood is on the hands of Fake News Media!  Taiwan is Next get out while you still can!
There is nothing resembling Natzis in Ukraine. Vladimir Putin is a rambling idiot, just like Donald Trump.
Because Europe need Russian petrol and gas lol,  just wait : Nordstream 2 will open in a few weeks
Because nobody wants world war 3.
Because they're afraid of Russia
They can but chooses not to
Oh they absolutely can. Threats of nuclear war keep people scared though. Putin risks the world going to nuclear war by invading
It would be stupid to rashly go into nuclearwar
@Tolo Tube. RUSSIA has more than 12 000 nuclear weapons...Some of these weapons are Megatons .An escalation, with direct involvement on the ground of western nuclear powers could lead to WWIII.
 @RJ P  that is true but it’s mainly not wanting to start another world war or nukes too, sadly their have their hands tied it’s sad
Europe needs Russia, that's the hook they can't get off.rThey can't do anything since they rely on the gas supplied by Russia (Nordstrom).Just look what Germany is doing right now, they don't want to stand in their way.Europe will never supply military backup, they only provide non-military help.All they can do is support Ukraine by severing ties on technology to Russia.That's some sort of punishment to Russia after triggering the attack.
 @tana gunda  yes,  and the parlment of Germany made it that way too,  the Greens put pressure to make the country respecting the greenhouse gas deadline...and to do so,  they need the natural gas from Russia
Europe vs Russia would be the biggest war ever seen in history, as a European of course we don't wan't this. Then this is an old story, almost all the Ukrainians want to go back to being part of a powerful country and they're sick of all the corruption going on.The problem is that some, especially the russophone part, want that powerful country to be Russia, others want to get closer to the European sphere.This is totally an internal political problem but because of the huge external pressure coming both from the US and Russia, what should have been solved politically is now resulting in a war. We can only hope this won't last too much, and that if Putin really wants to annex parts of Ukraine to Russia, let's hope again that the new borders of Ukraine will make both parties happy. May the prorussia cities go back to being part of Russia, may the rest come with Europe soon enough, hoping the americans won't fill that land with military bases.The West should have stopped threatening Russia many years ago, we can live in peace and we're all European brothers and sisters after all.
The world stands in paralyzed horror watching the crimes being wrought on the Ukraine. My heart goes out to the Ukrainian people 🇺🇸 ❤️ 🇺🇦
Yaaaa this is exciting I want the world to end
The boss can sock mee
This is so sad and horrible. I'm praying for everyone in Ukraine. This shouldn't be happened. I'm sending much love from South Korea
The number of Russians protesting the military action are far less than the million Londoners who opposed the Iraq War yet Blair went ahead and did it anyhow.Who ignores the will of their people?
The world is standing by while a country is invaded.
The blood of all Ukraine who die in this evil Barbaric act will be on Putin Russians who fail to protest against their leaders. God Almighty bless Ukraine people ❣️❣️🙏🙏🙏
Rubbish Putin
Where is Ukrainian air force ? Why not news of explosions from Russian realm ?
Russia right to defend from nato
It's not that bad . Covid is way worse of the problem.  Put your masks social distance and  get your boosters.  Russians will need to show  Ukrainian QR codes to enter Ukraine cities and they don't have it , so your safe. No worries.
Latvian: Putins izputinās Krieviju un Ukrainu!Dievs aicina uz mieru, darīt labu, mīlēt līdzcilvēkus! Mēs esam radīti mīlestībai un sadraudzībai, nevis mantkārībai un karam!
Though we Indians   🇮🇳 have been helped a lot by Russia 🇷🇺 in past but still I call this act from Russia as a violent act . My prayers goes to people in Ukraine 🇺🇦 .
Even the pandemic isnt as bad as what the ukranians are going through now. Feel sad fr them
NATO is a joke.   Your on your own
Zelensky, a good comedy actor who is hindered by politics. Perhaps, you are good actor, everything can be reversed in the comedy. But you are dwarf in politics.
Love and support to Ukraine 🇺🇦!
Nato responsible for this chaos
. . . hoping Putin will appoing Vladmir Klitschko as the new president of Ukraine.
Don’t give Russians visas, china gave you Covid no actions was taken  o Russia gave u world war 3 and all you want is give Russia financial sanctions?? Face Russia with fire
America/Nato interfere too much in the affairs of other countries, under the pretext of maintaining peace, the proof is that in the Middle East they are fighting each other, they come as if they are heroes of peace, Iraq is accused of having nuclear power, the president is executed and then for the new president, America has prepared it, continues to mine oil. Where is it going, the same thing was done in Afghanistan, now how many years ago they arrived in Syria even though the official government did not invite them, then patrolled the Syrian oil mines, I'm sure all countries know that but are silent because they are afraid of being punished by America, I emphasize not all stupid as you imagine hey america, now meet the one who has the nuclear meet the balanced opponent invites Nato your gang is nothing more than a loser,
Paralysed indeed
It stood in horror as the western gave aid to tplf against Ethiopia, it stood in horror when the Italian minister spilled the beans on France neocolonialism in africa, it stood in horror when Saudi committed genocide in Yemen with weapons supplied to the west, it stood in horror when NATO toppled Libya and western rebels killed Libyans. It stood in horror when israel killed Palestinian children, it stood in horror when US sanction turkey and Iran, it stood in horror when usa raped and killed millions of Iraqis. It stood in horror when US assassinated president of Haiti.
The same while „somebody“ was attacking irak, Serbia, Libya and Syria…
 @Jason Harper  💯
 @Veronica Chan  Russia is evil. Get over it and stop trying to make yourself feel better hypocrite
Ukraine - current prey of USAUSA triggered ukraine to join in NATOIf ukraine join NATO, USA can deploy their troops on russian border and threat russiaSo Russia reacted to safeguard themselvesUSA is the basic reason for all the war in earth currently, that cunning fox needs to be punishedWhatever the reason, killing civilians can't be justifiedRussia please don't follow like America, killing innocent people in middle east countries

If Putin Swallow Ukraine he will swallow More of European countries and he will become emperor again 🧐Then Russia up 🔼  USA and Europe  down ⬇️ 😑..
dont copy paste corona
Well, it's a war between Russia and the USA , Ukraine is only a battleground.
 @Kristoffer Pettersson  how it started
​ @Veronica Chan  Two wrongs dont make a right. Stop doing that. We aren't talking about the US. Also, Putin is responsible for shooting down MH17, siding with Asssad when the rest fought his troops to liberate Syrian people, he put bounties on US Soldiers, he constantly has his hacking groups close down powerplants and other infrastructure like banks or even hijackt hospital systems to get some money for future operations. Never a fair election since he was in power. Even scammed by putting Medevev there because of term limits. He kills political opponents and journalists in sovereign countries (he killed people in Germany, UK etc) He poisoned them even. He constantly makes sure Russian NEED to dope during Olympics, setting up a scheme to change urine at night. He placed bombs in apartment buildings in his own country, killing/wounding  hundreds of Russians just to get a (false flag) reason to attack Chechen in 1999 or so. He has navy and jets going over/through European airspace without notice, so we need to guide them out. Furthermore, he's just a troll and a terrible person. Can';t be compared to any other country or leader. China does it slow and silent. NK does not much. Iran does not much. The only threat to the world in these decades is him. Ask Finland, Poland, Baltics, Georgians, Chechen's and others. Or me, a Dutch, for him STILL blaming others for MH17, He';s not man enough to own it up. And then the smaller things, like bribing officials to host the WOrld cup football some years back.
 @Mr.Kongunadu Ukraine wanted to join NATO to keep this from happening, how can you stand with Russia who invaded a country for no reason other than saying it feels scared, even though Ukraine leaves Russia no threat.Tyh
 @Erik Shelton  If ukraine joins NATO, USA will deploy their troops on russian border and threat russiaSo it is basic sense for russia to protect themselves, if ukraine don't join NATO, then why would russia attack ?
 @Mr.Kongunadu  Have you forgotten that Russia already invaded Ukraine in 2014 and annexed Crimea? Why wouldn't Ukraine attempt to seek the protection of NATO? Hilarious how you blame the USA and NATO on Putin's greed.
🇺🇸 this tissue paper is the cause of all the problems of world. From middle East to Africa from Africa to asia and now in Ukraine.
 @Mr Chips  well said chips
 @George Cher  he wont touch europe at all.putin has no need for war trough fighting. he is winning economically. no need for himto invade when he can buy it trough the corruption of germany france and whole of damn european union. putin isnt gonna touch any none eastern block nation. he has to much to lose in his pocket book.
 @Mr.Kongunadu  They haven't joined NATO yet though. So I ask, why are you guys attacking civilians? Or is it just because you want a border with NATO anyway? That's literally what's gonna happen if Russia takes Ukraine lmao.
 @Trashboªt  It is very simple , Russia don't want NATO  on their borderUkraine trying to join NATO after all peaceful request from russia, so now they show their power to stop themOnce ukraine agree it will not join NATO, it can free country anytimeAlready russia added 2 new countries on ukraine - russia border for extra protection
 @Kristoffer Pettersson  Germany is Not evil, we are stupid… greetings from Germany ;)
 @Prügelkatze0815  yeah merkel is a saint right? im guessing u have missed what has beengoing on. but its ok. u truly are stupid as u said.
Also as an Indian... We are neutral and wish Russia a great future
As Indians, we are always for peace. But, USA action of placing missiles on the borders of Russia and the continuation and spread of NATO escalated the situation
Your leader is too busy sucking Putin off
 @Thuncerd  true
 @Jedi Maibam  well saidUSA cunning fox is behind all these games
There are millions of people in Russia who do not want war.
I support Russia because Ukraine sells weapons to pakistan terriost country
Indian always support Russian brothers no matter any reason
difference between 
 @Thuncerd  indeed. He's playing both India and Red China against each other so Russia can sell more weapons to both nations..
 @Jedi Maibam  you don't want peace with the minorities in your country. Everyone can google it.
 @Paul Fri  China doesnt buy Russian weapons anymore and India buys from Usa, Russia and France so your logic makes no sense
 @Jedi Maibam  but it was Russia that attacked first and bears full responsibility for the conflict.  don't use reverse logic
Actually USA & NATO pushed them into the war by expanding NATO into Russian border.. and usa also want to cut Russia out of Eu market. so they can sell their gas to EU market
 @Jedi Maibam  It's amazing how idiots still think pedaling this bullshit narrative works anymore. This was never about NATO or Russian security, this was all about controlling Ukraine, a democratic sovereign country of 44 million people. Putin will go down in the history books next to hitler and anyone who supports him is a monstrous entity.
 @Ghui Larov   Ukraine - current prey of USAUSA triggered ukraine to join in NATOIf ukraine join NATO, USA can deploy their troops on russian border and threat russiaSo Russia reacted to safeguard themselvesUSA is the basic reason for all the war in earth currently, that cunning fox needs to be punishedWhatever the reason, killing civilians can't be justifiedRussia please don't follow like America, killing innocent people in middle east countries
No body ask your Indian prayers
Russia doesn’t help you they just give you something to take 10x more later,Russia and China do the same in Africa,half of Africa belongs to Russia and China because they “helped” countries here and made some people very wealthy at the cost of a nations natural resources.
 @Richman  You racist people are talking about indiaIndia have hundreds of languages, culture, religion but we are united
did u call thebombing by ukraine a violent act?
 @Ajeet Singh  it’s really sad how the people in charge always let down and use the ones they are supposed to inspire.
 @Hurley Cape town  We Indians know exactly what happened . During Cold War era , United States needed Pakistans' help for wrapping Afghanistan.  Hence US and NATO stand on India Pak war were more lenient towards Pakistan  despite India 🇮🇳 being more democratic and more accommodating. Since the end of Global war , US don't want Pakistan either and as India grew as a better economy , now they change the stand but we Indians know Western societies well .
 @Richman  what do you know of my country? Google is not everything
 @fosterslover  go and buy some sense
 @botol kecap  nobody asks for ur reply
 @Mr.Kongunadu  what a stupid narrative.  if ukraine wants the usa alliance, then it should get it.  Putin seems to be offended by his 
 @Ghui Larov  Yes but America is a dirty cunning fox, it will trigger war between countries indirectly and stealing their wealthSo I am just acknowledging ukraine people to keep away from USAWhichever countries supported by USA in middle east are now exploited poor countries nowadaysRussia is better than USA, they don't do nasty political game like USA
 @Mr.Kongunadu  It is interesting that you are defending Russia this way, since it had many conflicts in the 21st century, including in Chechnya and Georgia.  You have to understand that Russia is not the most powerful country economically, yet it is in second place when it comes to the army.  This means it is a regional power and this is the reason why many of Russia's neighbors want an alliance with the US for a balance of power.  American soldiers on the territory of the country are a guarantee that Russia will not attack this country for fear of a counterattack.  if you analyze the map of europe, you will notice that the russian state 
 @Ghui Larov  Bro if you are from America, it will be hard for me to enlighten youIf you are not then it is simple, throughout the world.. All the countries need to protect their border so they have some conflict with neighborSee America attacking Vietnam and most of the middle east and asian countries, why ???They need to exploit and steal other country wealth, so USA will create some drama
 @Mr.Kongunadu  You don't need to enlighten anyone.  It's true that the great powers conduct their policies boldly and profit from it.  But how you describe the US operations in Asian countries is too oversimplified, it is not just about using and robbing them.  It is about influence in given countries.  In the twentieth century, two states, the Soviet Union and the United States, fought for influence in different regions of the world.  More recently, the Middle East has become an arena for two powers.  we can bid on who's worse, but that doesn't get anywhere.  remember a stick always has two ends.  I know countries that benefited from cooperation with the USA, e.g. the whole of Western Europe, South Korea and even the USSR during the Second World War, etc. Russia alone cannot take care of the well-being of its citizens, but for 50 years after the Second World War it robbed countries in the so-called Warsaw Pact  eastern europe.
 @Ghui Larov   you are also telling sameSo I am just saying ukraine please don't trust USA or NATO and spoil your countryNow ukraine have 2 options1. Joining NATO - Russia will attack, so ukraine will stop joining NATO and russia border will be safe2. Not Joining NATO - everything will run ausual and according to russia, russian border is safeI am telling if ukraine choose option 2, it will be good of ukraine
 @Mr.Kongunadu  but do you know that nato is by definition a defensive alliance? Throughout the history of this pact, he has not been the aggressor. Unlike Russia.There is something wrong with the government of russia.  in 1947 they rejected a marshal plan that would help them.  I don't know, maybe their pride prevented them from accepting help.  they have also renounced all war repairs also on behalf of their republics and minor allies. after all, they have no allies in the region and can only use force to influence the decisions of the neighboring authorities.
 @Ghui Larov  No country or organization is aggressive currently, no one use nuke for past 70 yearsNATO is controlled by USA, USA is a cunning animal it can change its face at any timeSo Russia don't want a cunning animal to stand near its borderYou are just hating russia I guess
Watching from Kenya 🇰🇪.....Africa
oh myy god please be safe everyone <3
Well, what do you say now, Ango-Saxon Nazis? The queue for London and the royal family. You will answer us for Nicholas 2 and Hitler's financing.
Yall were silent when Israel slaughtered Palestinians and they still are killing them and abusing them and now look at you all, hypocrites. You are so loud right now  and when its time to speak up against oppression against Palestinians and Kashmiris you remain silent and whoever raises their voice they are 'anti-semetic'.
Shame on the western diplomacy, how to stop it,without collateral damages cut all financial connection without delay 'to block offshore institutions with Russia',airplane connections should be stopped.But again still on the much talk ,discussions..and tralali....tralala.
Just horrible why a country twice the size wants to bomb a country smaller . Look at how these so called leaders aroumd the world. Have no regard for human life. This is bullshit that a fringe minority of so called leaders, president, monarchie, kings , and queens etc.... Make life for other humans horrible. The ideal that governments have control to just bomb someone is awful. It's like there playing a video game . evil plain and simple.
The American democratic administration should be ashamed of its weakness in front of Russia and the abandonment of the people of Ukraine and the Syrian people to the dictator Putin.
Why civilians should suffer for political issues.  Why and why innocent people should die in this way. 😭😭
The U.S. is making Russia look like a villain in the eyes of the world
what is Putin thinking? Why? I feel for you Ukraine and hope this madness will stop
Wouldn't like too say what I would like too do to HIM.  !!
Just pray for peace!
Eu and un need to look into this and declare a proposition for both countries only they can appeal a matter of this sort and save innocent lives into political war.
Putin making up lies to justify invasion
We stand with Russia, Zionist puppet Ukraine go home. Kiev belongs to Russia
The US doesn´t have the Balls to attack Russia.
MAKE AVAILABLE PUTINS ENTIRE SPEECH TRANSLATED IN TO ENGLISH!!! BBC DO YOUR JOB FOR ONCE
Beautiful people of Russia it's time to get rid of your dictator
No one cares
He is probably thinking f it let's invade Ukraine
He just care about keeping his stupid hegemony of soviet-era alive.
Putin said that he doesn't want US missiles parked in the Ukraine which will happen if the Ukraine joins NATO. The US did the same thing when Russia tried to park it's missiles in Cuba back in the 60's. The US was ready to sink Cuba before Russia parked it's missiles there. Too bad the civilians are the ones who suffer the most.
Di nazification?????  WHAT!?!?!?!? Putin Is so high
The answer of nato is sanction, very funny. They are all comedian. Where are the words of the deadbrain president of america.
This is horrible...let them stop this😭😭😭
I think this situation happened because the United States did not do their job. It is questionable whether the United States can be confident that it is the police of the world.
Don't care. Just glad that the coming nuclear war will clear out all our commiecrats.
this is fake news. in 2014 the ukraine country government was forced out by the low life in charge now, he has ruin the country and for the people into poverty, and majority of the people support russia and wants to take back ukraine from the western puppet government. it’s happening in many countries around the world, the usa is stealing countries and killing to take their resources. all the protestors are paid to cause problem, and the reporters paid to talk in favor of the western imperialist. only the wealthy are benefiting while the people and countries are ruined. don’t trust the main stream media, billions of dollars is being used to pay all these people off. it’s the same in middle east, all those people murdered for the resources by the western governments and their allie’s in the east.
Fake news, Russia sent invading anyone, we have friends in Kiev. This is USA wanting another war and a distraction from the covid narrative thats falling apart.
😭😭😭😭😭
We should have taken russia out after second world war.Patton was right.
Get this weak Biden out of the WH and put The real President Trump in the WH..He will take care everything..Home and abroad
Please stop name of humanity peace 🙏.
You all push Putin hand. The west have been imperialist for a long time. Ask the brown, black and yellow people.
🇱🇻❤🇺🇦
People dying while Putin is sitting with sunglasses chilling in a pool. Prayers to the people in Ukraine🙏🙏🙏
Wow this is very sad.
Russia is bigger and more powerful.How can Ukraine be a threat????Stupidity in Action(SIA).
I’m worried about citizens in Ukraine. I hope that their life will be normal as soon as possible.
This is unacceptable, to have war in Europe in 2022, to lose the lives of our fellow friends, young people with their future ahead, parents fearing for their kids. The West MUST take a step and help defend what we worked for since WW2 and the Cold War. This is not what our values represent, we must help the innocent civilians and the soldiers that are protecting their home. I hope that the world wakes up and helps Ukraine, as this is an attack directed to all of us and our freedom.
Where the heck are the returning retaliation...... silence
Trump is a Putin puppet n Biden is weak we need a real war president who will stand up to Russia n China.
“Weeks of extraordinary calm” it’s laughable how western media can paint such a brutal picture for us. Ukrainians have been at war with Russia since 2014 this is NOT new for them this is an EMBOLDENED Russia.    With the west looking weaker than ever eastern powers will now mount their claims. NEW WORLD ORDER
There's no resistance at all
Whoever doubted him is dumb
Playing war games for 15 years on Russian boarders.   Wtf did they think he would do.
Putin is right to kick the NAZIS out of Ukraine.
Seems everyone support ukraine or russia but from the start peace was never an option. To state the fact Russia don't want NATO at his border and have military base from people who consider them enemie in font of his nose on the other hand EU and USA push Georgia Poland and now Ukraine to come to NATO but they was an agreement between EU USA and RUSSIA that NATO won't come at his border and country sided to Russia will remain neutral from this side no one can't blame Russia for attacking however Russia's president Putin still have nostalgy of the glory of the past URSS and still want all these countries to become one again with Russia from this side we can said may be M putin intend is hidden behind the broke agreement of NATO with Russia. But why let Georgia and Poland go to NATO and EU in this case? Anyway trying to find who is wicked and who is not here is not the question all the question needed is about people who  just want to live peacfully from both side Ukraine and Russia.
o-oh
Please Putin take back your troops.🙏
History has taught us that Europe and the west of the west (USA, Canada, Australia and etc) will talk and do nothing other than sanctions.  Sanctions have never worked.  I heart bleeds for the fee people of Ukraine!  I feel heart broken that another nation will fall under Russian oppression again.  Another Chamberlin moment.  The west must take up arms against Russia.  As it will occur for Poland, East Germany, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuanian.  Who knows, but possible.
Putin Hitler Napoleon all have something in common short in height but want to rule the 🌎
Слава России
please cover Middle east like this and there will be zero wars
Is really US and UK closer to Ukraine than Russia? Who's really drawing a wedg between brothers? This is evil western tactic to achieve what they want
The United Nations saysRussia's one-day attack on Ukrainian military bases is genocide. Was the United Nations asleep when Saudi Arabia and the UAE bombed Yemeni hospitals, homes and schools that had been under siege for eight years with weapons purchased from the United States and Europe?!?!?
Stop expanding nato don't trust western nations stop war 🇮🇳❤️🇷🇺🇺🇦
Anglo always has looooong nose
I Hate War...
Ukraine was used by USA to attack Russia & expanding NATO in to Russia. President Putin & Russia has the full right to protect Russian interests just like USA does all over the world. Weldone President Putin Long live Russia
Could Putin be targeted for assassination for war crimes ?
It looks normal there in the Capitol!
Neto not going to save Ukraine otherwise who going to save Neto. America is a spineless super power they have no guts to attack Russia they only attack week Nations they can not attack them back but Russia is a very powerful Nation so America afraid to Russia. This is time to face music Europe after second world war.
Finally Ukraine will be liberated from the occupiersUraa 🇷🇺❤️🇷🇺❤️🇷🇺
50 helicopter go tu Kiev low flight on road
I stand with Ukraine they r brave love ALLAH PROTECT U DON'T WORRY
Love to Puzin.....you started with all and now is time to you to get answer...Putin didnt started you arr...and you all be down soon. Love to Putin grom Croatia
It is the fault of Biden and Boris Johnson and NATO. Biden and Johnson talking about sanction. What a foils. Sanction is for long term pressure which should've started Ling time ago. This is a war and do you think Putin is scared of sanction now?
ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE!
Only way is every countries should scrap weapons and make up big peace for the future.. no more build up nuclear weapons etc. That should never happened years ago.. why countries build thier weapons at first place.  That no points to use it..  it stupid of it plus waste of money.
This isn’t a war Russia, Ukrainian or the USA want! But we have two old men with power hunger in their heart. Knowing that they are safe meanwhile the youth will die fighting their war! Biden isn’t as innocent as many make him seam, they could have sign to not allow Ukrainian into nato and promised Ukrainian a military solution if they were attack after that peace treaty was signed. But with everything failed in the U.S Biden needed another chaos to look good! Now that Covid has America tiered and are seeing the prices of everything from gas to food at a all time high, they figured this is the perfect distraction not seeing that this could become the end of it all! There should be a cap on how old a person can run for president not to young and definitely not to old! They have one foot in the grave and another one in the hospital. All both care about is legacy what they will be remembered by, that’s very scary because we are tokens in the middle of their ride!
Absolutely appalling, I have no words. My heart goes to the Ukrainian families who lost loved ones and homes 🇺🇦❤️Edit : Of course the Russian families who lost relatives and friends in the conflict are also included. It's mind boggling to witness the beginning of this war so everyone who is in the middle of this are in my prayers.
Why you taking about nazi? Ukraine collaborate with nazi and they been guard on nazi camp's! Peace form Poland for all Ukraine brothers but don't change the history.
Victory for Russia 🇷🇺 ❤️
China and Russia are closest political ally. China has caused man-made pandemic to kill over 5 million people, another country has premeditated to wage war for killing. Go to hell,  UN.
Nato keeps pointing  missiles at russia then gets other countries to do the same. Like having a neighbour getting a gang to surround your house and u ask whats going on and they say nothing then you ask to join the gang and your not allowed.
It’ll be world war now. Or slavery
ARE THE LEADER OF THE WORLD JUST GOING TO STAND AND WATCH?!? if we let him destroy the Ukraine, who's going to be next? He said he would strike against anyone to interferes.. he just threatened the world! We either stand back and become monsters of a human race as people are slaughtered or we stand up for our planet as a whole and stop Russia from attacking.
What will be the next target after Ukraine's incorporation into Russia?Georgia?Taiwan?
The American people are behind the Russians. I'm not even joking, check out Fox news comments section
In Lugansk and Donetsk .
'Horrifying Moment' Russian Bombs Drop All Over Ukraine https://youtu.be/ApuUWKuTJzw

Just like Germany's air raids on Britain in WW2.It's not going to accomplish what they think it's going to accomplish.
where u as appauled when ukraine bombed russia? just a few weeks or months ago?im guessing u wernnt.usa and ukraine started this not russia. remember that.
🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
You are fake. You are KGB
What about lydians one's, killed by nato
Never disrespect russian and putin.
America probably needs to do a Soleimani on Putin in Moscow in broad daylight. But if the Russians can retaliate then that probably wouldn't happen.
Whe stande wd ukrine😍
Does your heart go out to the Syrian people being bombed weekly by Israel and that US and Turkey military invaded Syria and are stealing Syrian oil? And the murder of Qaddafi and wrecking and looting of Libya by the West?
And the russian familes who's young soldiers are dying in a dumb war
Does your heart goes out to the people  who had to flee after the kindergarten bombing who only want to be free from persecution as well?
 @kreme pye  Absolutely. It's terribly sad to think about the young generation experiencing this war.
lol at everyone who joked on the west being 
Russian civilization began in Ukraine, the first Russian state had capital in Kyev. They speak the same language write in the same alphabet, have same Eastern Orthodox religion, eat the same food & have way way more in common, then differences. The Ukrainian government is to blame for this, for breaking the brotherhood between the two countries and pushing their own personal agendas trying to benefit from this. Why did the Ukrainian president have to call Biden? Shouldn't he have called Putin for this, when Biden doesn't even speak Russian?
God bless Russia,
Putin now has made his biggest mistake. Russia will within matters of weeks become the most isolated nation in Europe.
Death to putin and russia !!! keep strong ukraine nato is comming
Putin thinks after this the folks in Ukraine will just cooperate and be happy? Vladimir dear, we are living in a different world. It is no longer 1950.
RESIGNATIONS AT NUMBER TEN DOWNING!!
Putin has vodka for brains
Is world war 3 possible? Anyone?
My deepest sympathy for Ukrainian people 🙏🏻
Whatever the reason,leaders must not involve civilians.😒
That is why anti aircraft stingers and anti tank weapons are very important.  Russia can destroy all the airports and other command and control buildings but individuals can hide everywhere with those shoulder fired weapons and those weapons will take a toll on Russia.
Covid is already hard to live now you want a war. Right.... What is humanity becoming
Horrible, he talk like Justin Trudeau... disgusting
Acatually RUSSIA Show's His Power against USA 'UK AND EU' Countries...My Question is Where is  Human Community ...?If any Muslim Country Show this kind of activity then All The EU Countries wake up and their Humanity Card strat....Now Every EU AND USA NATO  Allinence start Statement Against RUSSIA ...No one Semd Their ARMY agains RUSSIA....Because RUSSIA now in Strong Military position .
God help Ukraine !! This is horrible
Everyone saying they support ukraine yet you guys don't want to send troops come on this is just like what Germany did
Mad man like Putin understands only the use of force and thet's what should be used against him. West should put Putin in place once and for all. We had a Hitler in our history now we have Putin. We won against Hitler and we win against Putin.
Ordinary Russians need to rise up now and take their country back from putin the madman. His continued presence makes World War 3 all the more likely.
To part quote the BBC presenter, 
Would love to know who the Russians a defending themselves from no one attack them, and Ukraine is hardly a threat.
Ww3 here we are 🙏🏾🤯😢🤦🏾‍♂️💔
All western media are liers
Who cares Ukraine is full of neo nazis plus they are not part of nato so why should nato help
Ukraine! We pray for you! And Yes, Russian President Putin is  chicken. Attacking smaller countries. Try attacking someone like US or INDIA.
Putin Fight vs Neo Nazi regime in kiew .And the world suport the Nazi regime in kiew
The mainstream media propaganda war machine will use footage from 2014. The Ukrainians want to be free from tyranny !!!
Yeah let's call Biden. Biden ramps the conflict but in the final analysis will do nothing.
Where is the airport? Unless you mean military airport? Your other western media showed the same scenes and called it military points and targets.
Which stocks can I invest in to profit from this?
How many people has to die before NATO steps in.. USA you're all talk and no action
we stand for ukraine from uk
so the us tried to use ukraine to put pressure on putin ( by voiding the agreement that keeps the ukraine as a buffer zone between russia and Nato ) and now that the whole country is punished for the greed of politicians, the west is just going to stand idle and watch, while mothers and fathers mourn their children and their country. I am not saying that putin is not a monster, but we have to agree that the us politics, once again, is as or more dispicble.
Just tell us about the war's news and stop the propaganda. No one is helping Ukrainians , the western countries are just like Russia. So stop your hypocrisy.
8:06This woman has an impeccable grip over how wars should be.
Zelinsky is to blame, he is fool and puppy of Biden and US, they manipulate him like a 2nd grade kid with candy to go to fight with big boys, he tought US and EU will cover his ass instead he is left alone now, Puttin is very long into this and he is 
Russia is evil and devil
Of course, it is wise to sacrifise Ukraine for prevention of ww3. UN is pathetic, as Eu and NATO. You prooved that Ukraine is better off alone
Signs of the end of the World are nigh
Just remember American defense companies still found a way to profit from this.
😔
Putins War not Russian War.😄 Putin is Delusional.
ah, Rich white people are dying because of war? That's not good... It is supposed to be Muslims and Africans
just when 2021 out did 2020... 2022 showed up
putin what the fuck
Nazis Fleeing to Home Germany Again,  😊
The west will not do anything to help help Ukraine because they are afraid of Russia and this will not be the last country Russia will be taking by force
Dear Vladimir Putin,You're a ¢unt.Love, The Civilized World. XXX
wheres the avengers when you need them
Where's nati and u.s now they left the group..hahaha.. pray for the brothers and sisters in ukraine nato and u.s where are you??
Make Putin and Russia pay. Putin cannot be trusted. History is repeating itself again. Winston Churchill has been proven  correct. If the Russian people don’t support this invasion, they must revolt.
How come others sources are saying at least 50% of Russian civilian population favors this invasion?
Remember that time when Hitler marched through Europe and the Allies didn't lift a finger to stop him? Yeah, neither do I.
Let two brothers decide, nato do not interfere, don’t you understand that you only make the situation worse. Ukrainian people always were brothers to post Soviet Union countries and look what you’ve done. There is always war in those regions were nato comes. Europe stay in Europe and US with its bloody history of killing native American population has no right to name themselves peacekeepers. Learn history please and don’t play games with Russia. It’s not Syria or Afghanistan were you can pump you money out
Communist mindset is like DESTRUCTIVE. CHINA and RUSSIA is world dangerous countries
He’s a mad man. A lunatic. He’s gone boo loo.
My thoughts and prayers to all Ukrainians 🙏🏽🙏🏽 This is heartbreaking, so heartbreaking
Putin knew the US and allies are gonna do shit all western country becomes too pussy
Very frightening...but it is time to leave Ukraine folks. Prayers to all civilians.
Stop lying that was not Russia that was America or Nato false flag attack
God love these people 😢🇺🇦🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
This will be another Bosnia.. What is NATO doing?
West stands with Ukraine.  Russian citizens need to wake up and condemn their leader.  This is an evil war and even though it is an authoritarian state the people there need to take responsibility for the person using their resources and might to murder neighbors.  We are all one people under God, brothers and sisters in the light no matter what nationality or creed.  Peace for Ukraine
God help and bless Ukraine, Love from Africa 🇳🇬♥️🇺🇦
He is the biggest Coward and liar!!!  Russia need a better and peaceful Leader!!! Pray for Ukraine 🙏🏼
Westerns invaded Africa,now they are busy looting everything from it.Russia is doing just excellent!
This day and age this is hard to take in. What the hell is going on in the world I’m honestly lost for words.
Jesus is coming turn your lives to him
For 30 years Russia said, don't expand NATO to the East Europe and bring missiles close to usFor 30 years they are saying and screaming to the WestAnd finally NATO want to add Ukraine also to NATO, in that scenario it's like NATO missiles just opposite to Russia's borderTell me, for 30 years the Russians negotiated and warned the NATO and the west, enough is enough now
Pootin go to hell 💀
I really don't like Russia leave Ukraine tf alone they think they own everything
Good on Russia. Support from UK. The Nazi regime in Kiev had this coming
A madman has been unleashed upon the world - and look who we have to defend innocent people from him.  Putin chose his time well.
West started this and west will fall.
for no reason the US invaded iraq and Afghanistan...and the whole world supported them,,,,now we seeing Russian invasion....the irony
The western block is equally to blame for this sad day. This is what I call a manufactured crisis. Knowing Russia, you first make them uneasy with all the NATO talk and security concerns giving him a perfect guise of then using the same rhetoric and only acting upon it. Now ya all can sit on the sidelines and play 
Were is NATO and American propaganda always

Just goes to show how despite having the UN and other bodies, if a country has enough money and weapons they can do whatever they want. Almost exactly as what the US did in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and the rest of the Middle East
Ukraine keep strong, I support you from your neighborhood romania, when i heard what happend and see this footages i get a feeling of deep sadness almost started crying seeing this but the anger against this neo-communist f*cks is bigger,we have to defend our basic right to defend ourself
They need surface to air missiles, wtf!
behind closed doors weak biden , the germans, and the quiet nato countries have already agreed of giving a part of ukraine to russia... unless biden and the dems sets up a false flag in the US before the midterm and blames putin
Ukrainians you are on your own and I'm sorry for that. You would think that the world has learned from WWll. God help us all. The very own existence of Humanity is at stake.
I hope Biden stays the fuck out of it……I’ll be ready for war on the homeland if we get drug into ww3
Planet earth we don’t deserve you.
Full support for Russia 🇷🇺
Russia wants  those drone bombs huh?
so he's willingly killing civilians
You guys forget Russia is been at war with Ukraine within eastern Ukraine. Its not Americas business. China Russian alliance in a world conflict will cripple either country or both. This is russian business and we have no business about it. Russia needs Ukraine more than we need Ukraine.
Prayers for Ukraine from Canada. 🇺🇦🇨🇦

Putin said he wants to Demilitarzation and de-nazification Ukraine.noun: de-nazificationthe process of bringing the leaders of the National Socialist regime in Germany to justice and of purging all elements of Nazism from public life, carried out especially between 1945 and 1948.
Propaganda
The UK and the US provoked this war and now they are happy. Russia is beating Ukraine and they are happy. Only Ukraine got beaten and felt sad about it.
Putin is dictator!
Put in let his army warm up & ready to take over EU
There is always two sides just think about that, why Putin did this, what is the role of NATO
War is peace ✌️🕊️
USSR lost bigtime in Afghanistan by only help of CIA to Mojahedin , now Ukraine has both US and EU to help them against Russia aggression
Bless these people
The president of Ukraine is Jewish, Putin. So what the hell do you mean by nazification? You’re so full of it.
The Bible spoke clearly of a time of tribulation and trouble. When mankind would abandon biblical morality and then be squeezed by droughts/diseases/fires/floods/earthquarkes/wars and other disasters before the return of Jesus Christ. The time is near.
This is horrible. That old man is a war-like wild beast.
Putin is psycho
I'm asking on what drugs is Vladimir Putin? Threats to him from Modern Ukraine? Denacization? I want some of those drugs this guy spitting massive crap
this is not a conflict the Russian want... stop lying.  it doesn't help. Putin is loved by like 98 percent of the people. He does this cause he has the support of his people. you think he is stupid he is ex KGB.. dummies
Fight back like these guys : https://youtu.be/FKlHa-J1vIQ
I feel like this is overhyped and fake
bam boom bam bam boom.... no defence weapons, no chance. Ukraine have a new boss soon
One sided commentary ,BBC as usual
This is bullying...
War of occupation has begun. 'peace keeping and no occupation'; what a lier.
ну шо, скоро нас в рашке закроют всем миром и будет снова СПЛОТИМСЯ ВОКУРГ ВОЖДЯ и военный коммунизм
Good luck Ukraine. You're gonna need it!
Well done Joe 👍
Horrible days are coming to Russian citizens and suffering will last years. that is, if they survive.
The best option  for the  ukraine was being neutral for both Russian and NATO. Countries sandwiched between  supper powers has to ballance both side...actually such Countries cannot function with full autonomy..That's the reality...If took one side other side will crush it...and the other side will not always come to protect us.I'm in a country which is influenced by the power battle between India and China.. Only neutrality makes sense.at the cost of autonomy...what to do....otherwise the turbulence made by superpowers  crush us.I think Ukrainian missed that very basic by being more favour for USA and NATO. Though this is not correct...Russian response is natural....any supper power will do the same.I Don't know ...this is how I saw the world. There are no true humanity...Only power will win ultimately..Very rarely power goes to hand of good people. Smaller nations are suffering in every corner. Being neutral is the best way...If NATO is really defending democracy,  why are they silent against  Saudi Arabia,   Many African countries,  China... why they not defend Palestinian..It's just about there supremacy....Not about innocents or innocence democracy. Just wish the humanity will survive among these clash of  superpowers for power.
Pray for Ukraine 🇺🇦 🙏
That russian lady said 
Slava Ukraini!🇺🇦
What the fuck is this guy doing??? We have suffered so much and now ww3
Putin is the devil
Stay strong Ukrainian people🇺🇦
Well.......when you wage war on Russian separatists for 8 years.....it was bound to happen
It's all about Russian president and Ukranian president..
Putin is crazy.  Ths man is bullshitt...
The U.S. and UK need to stop provoking Russia
Who could have imagined that the XXIth Century would have it's very own Hitler, cute!
Watch China go for Taiwan and Serbia go for Kosovo this is how the world war 3 starts ladies and gents..
PUTIN HAS A PLACE NEXT TO HITLER AND STALIN IN THE LOWEST LEVEL OF HELL !
Putin's statement sounds a lot like what previous US presidents have said when declaring wars... Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan...
希望乌克兰人民不会受到伤害
May Ukraine live in less interesting times. 🇺🇦
Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

Ufo coming to the rescue?
Can you guys remember invading Iraq? Because of what? Eh? Washing Powder?
🇺🇦 ❤️
Putin - a man who can never be trusted. By anybody.
You get what you bargained for.
West is sleeping as they used to and Americans never rescued someone in their history never ever
THIS IS THE FAULT OF ALL MEMBER OF NATO!!..THATS WHY HAVE A WAR BETWEEN RUSSIA AND UKRAINE!!
join NATO more. 😂😂USA is enjoying this show from White House, that's what they wanted to see.

Prayers for Ukraine civilians 🙏🙏
Democratic. What kind of demoncratic? When u just organize neo nazis and distabilize ukraine back in 2014 and install US govt.. this is what u get when u dont accept the minsk aggrement.and kept licking the azzes of ur master(US) oh. Where r they now? They just fooled u.
Ukraine is not forgotten 🙂
soon LONDON WILL BE LIKE THAT !!!!!!!!!!!!!! fuck UK NAZIST!!!!!!!!!!
I don’t agree with the Russian Regime, but I must concede Putin has bigger ‘Balls’ than any of the western leaders! He is a tactician and a superb chess player 🤷‍♂️ he has outclassed Biden, Boris, macron and the German chancellor
Where is the Ukrainian army? We see much footage of Russian army, but I see no footage of Ukrainian army.
those jets are 99% Russian
Please pray for our people in Ukraine and Russia.  😔😒😩😏❤️❤️❤️❤️
Don't worry Ukraine God is watching
My heart goes out to Ukraine, from the UK. I hope you stay as safe as possible throughout this, UK 🤝 Ukraine
Fuck Russia
Prayers to the people of Ukraine! 🙏🏻🙏🏻
Somebody’s gotta give up some booty!
We pray for peace in Ukraine and victory against Russian forces and Hitler Putin. Dastardly Putin must be taught a lesson and only the US and NATO can do that. Putin has no right to invade democratic Ukraine's sovereignity, independence and freedom. Putin's Russia is nothing but a gas station, an oligarchy, corrupt cronyism and violater of human rights. Let Putin be cursed !
We are all with Ukraine. How can we help?
prayers goes to innocent civilians,FROM INDIA.
Russia have every right to dismantle a neighbour that harbor it enemies! What has UK been doing in Ukraine? UK SHOULD BE THE NEXT TARGET!
https://youtu.be/fy910FG46C4
From the country that has invaded most of the world? ROFL
Y'all did India Hella dirty☻ Australia got invasive species because of UK. I can keep going but the list is way to long. #GetThePoint

 @RenkyoKrishna  and we also stopped you becoming German.
Praying for all the innocent people of Ukraine.
Sorry - Putin is starting a war, escalating it and is now blaming Ukraine on being the threat?
Russia just targeting military not civilians...
This is all so very frightening and sad. I can't imagine what effect this will have on the world, but my heart is heavy with what the Ukrianian mothers are going through with the thought of their innocent children who are at threat of being cold bloodedly murdered! ..... For personal reasons and for all the people of Ukraine please hold hands with us and Pray that Putin changes his mind and lets the people of Ukraine live without threat of loosing their lives! 🙏
YES PUTIN MY MAN DONT MESS ABOUT HES  GAME AS A BADGER
You're the one who's bringing blood to the border line what the fuck are you talking about?
Thanks to the the US regime change 
5:23 “it will be like another Nazi occupation” is this guy serious! Nazis have been parading throughout ukraine burning Russian flags, book, and people you’re already under Nazi occupation mate. Putin is doing you a favour.
Ukraine government has killed many ukranians but this didn’t go on TV! That is why we need help from Russia. People don’t understand. Zelensky is the killer of our family
go Russia go.
Russia😐Putin will be need to answer
The media is painting out Russia to be the criminals when in reality they are not, it is everyone else who are the real criminals, Russia is defending their country, I don’t believe none of this media s*it

Ukraine doesn't need to surrender there fighting for there freedom against Russia and puttin..
Oh God please help Ukraine 🇺🇦 🙏
Inaction and 
There is no way Ukraine can defend itself without superior air forces.
Yeah, nothing says 
 @Extreme Griefer Jesus  u calm down pal
Dogs are the ones who fight for food
Let’s go RUSSIA🇸🇮❤️🇷🇺
.l
This has been planned for years.
It's a military airport.  Russia is disabling Ukraine's air defences after coming under air attacks.  As for the BBC,
Most probably a yank false flag.
Great theatre.Another nazi occupation.Well spoken by a nazi.The Azov regiments are Nazi units.Simple google search.Great actors anyway.
Everyone saying russia is the devil, but we forget all the invasions america has been doing over the years..this is big dick little dick era we are living with
Lets Go Brandon!
I literally searched 
This ruthless pressing forward to attack, only invigorates China, who will be waiting to see what happens, probably still wanting to do the same to Taiwan. These 
God bless people of both the contries ❤️
Once again nato and america show their uselessness...bunch of dead alliance, what's all that trillion dollars military tech for???for decoration and toy??useless nato
No one is getting out now
Putin needs to be stopped. He planned this for years.  He is a genius and a madman. Not a good combo. This is gonna lead to a new world war. Sanctions isn’t going to stop him. He planned all this and knows the cause and effect for all our actions. I don’t want a war and I think Putin is a smart man. He knows he has many nuclear weapons and he can scare countries with that being a threat to stop us from intervening. I also think his nuclear threats are bullshit. If he knows what’s good for him and his people, he wouldn’t revert to nuclear warfare.
They are not part of nato so why should nato help
Putin is a mad man! My prayers for Ukrainians 🙏💕🥰 🇳🇬
Putins way of removing a Jewish president under the pretext of removing nationalism in Ukraine while they themselves have a growing nationalistic movement is just ironic and sad.
Truth!
I can't stand to see helpless children suffer because of one man's ego.
Funny how Putin said he's doing this in the name of 
Since I was born, this is the first time I'm seeing what I read in history. May we choose peace over war because the consequences of war is too much to bear. My heart goes to the people of Ukraine 🇺🇦.
Russias most evil president
This is what happens when you play fire with a nuclear power using your country as tool by another power to bully and threaten  another power
He calls for denazification when his attack literally personifies the German invasion of Poland in 1939? C’mon man
The west should not intervene
Putin: support 2 states independenceRussia military: fire missile !!!
Even Russians aren’t happy with another nation by them losing their freedom. Why? Because they know they can’t have it for themselves while their leader tell them and others that they are his pawns.
every sane person knows who is the aggressor. this isnt about ukraine. it is about the war on democracy
The two kings with their hearts bent on evil will sit at the same table and lie to each other but to no avail because an end will still come at the appointed time Daniel 11 27
Just think if Ukraine called Palestine ! upps, can you still hear something !?
Why is this making me cry? I not a person who cries, I haven't cried in a while but this has tears flowing.  😭 what is wrong with Putin 😭😭😭😭😭
The full on him to compare Ukraine to nazis this shit was unprovoked, Putin is the next Hitler or stahlin.
So heartbreaking.
UN and their allies don't like Russia so they think we care about  Ukraine hahaha
But Putin warned that he doesn't mess with western criminals!

If western country attack any country, it is not violet any law. But when Russia attack,  he broken all law. Shame western  media. We can not hope from BBC such kind of news. NATO and American policy is fully responsible for this situation.  I hope Bbc broadcast real news.
Stay strong Ukraine, the rest of the world stands with you 🇺🇦The Kremlin has completely lost their collective minds. They will pay for this
Just think if Ukraine called Palestine ! upps, can you still hear something !?
I don't pray only for Ukraine, but for everyone who does prefer peace over war.
Usa and Nato only can invade week countries like Libya,  iraq afghanistan and Vietnam!!!! Against strong opponents they flee like a wiped dog
This is crazy, how can you attempt to attack a sovereign state, let me ask you, if you win this battle will you establish a Republican state in in Ukraine or what will be your opinion mr Putin?? I really respect you...but what you are doing is really frightening. No one wants war anymore people are already tragedy by ISIS and other jihadists movements yet again you want to destroy peace and livelihood.. shalom from Namibia.
This is horrible.
The year 2022 has a futuristic ring to it for a third world war. I hate to say it ladies and gentlemen but you'll all be seeing nuke shelters before the end
US AND OTHER MAJOR COUNTRIES NEED TO STOP RUSSIA NOW! Russia is violating and undermining international laws. If UN or NATO fails to stop Russia and Ukraine is successfully invaded, it will render all international laws useless. Nothing will be stopping other countries from this same thing, especially China which has been eyeing Taiwan for quite a long time now. and if that happens we'd have a sh*tstorm ahead of us.
It's very shameful that! the world leaders don't respect Children
The intelligence was never in question.  After two weeks worth of civilians chatting to the press about how a Russian invasion will never happen.  And now?  Roads backed up with those same people fleeing.  Herd mentality is certainly real, but is anyone ever satisfied living as a refugee?🤔
Putin says he's afraid of NATO being on his doorstep. He's trying awfully hard to make sure they are.
Why does Russia want to invade Ukraine?
Ukraine is not democratic and Putin did warn the west what would happen if they dont take him seriously. He did say any arms in Ukraine supplied by the west will be destroyed
This is a horrible sight. Hope everyone is safe and my heart goes out to the civilians. ❤❤
So sad to see the situation escalate so quickly. :(
The gov is urging people to “stay calm” are you serious
Putin is such a liar, a sick man. My heart is going out to Ukraine. Love from Finland 🇫🇮
ALL HAIL MOTHER RUSSIA♥️🇷🇺💥

FEW EVIL MEN TRIUMPH BECAUSE BILLIONS OF GOOD MEN DO NOTHING!!!!!
Why was there not so much sympathy and emotion when the Ukrainian army bombed Donetsk and Lugansk for 8 years?
Russian air force bombed indiscriminately in Syria, Ukraine will not be different. Russian Air Force has repeatedly bombed hospitals in Syria in order to crush the last pockets of resistance to Assad. The Syrian Network for Human Rights : Russian airstrikes killed around 5,703 civilians, about a quarter of them children. SNHR: 
The media wanted this blm is over the rats need something to do
 @Hagz Tanz  you think it’s a fantasy world
 @George Cher  yes
Your hope and heart doesnt do anything for them
 @Дед Мазай  Who said they weren’t?
 @George Cher   we won't let it Happen, if the idiot Putin thinks he is gonna get away with this, hes mistaken Badly
Russia is gonna whoop yo ass
Putin do what he need to do..He stop the arm sales
 @Дед Мазай  Because only those support the west will have human rights.
Amen
#standwithrussia

Yeah I don't think everyone's safe.
 @joe key  say that to US arm dealerThey kills most of the ppl
How in the hell is everybody going to be safe?
 @himanshu somalkar  если вы поддерживаете диктатора Путина, у вас нет сердца, суверенитет наших стран был нарушен, и мне все равно, поддерживаете ли вы нас, но сочувствуете#СлаваУкраине #Ukraini #saveukraine #изпутиниз
Great Britain with its great voice and great army should go over right now.
America probably needs to do a Soleimani on Putin in Moscow in broad daylight. But if the Russians can retaliate then that probably wouldn't happen.
 @Juan Crespo  you shut up
I'd wanna hope this is all a bad dream but it isn't, i pray for all the innocents that die in Ukraine, god bless from Russia.
 @George Cher  what will happen to Israel????
 @RUST Funny  Go play rust kid or watch some marvel movies
EVERYONE IS HARDLY SAFE.
Gee thanks Biden another outstanding success for your so called Presidency !  What’s next joe World War 111 ?
Peace will never come as long as Ukraine join NATO FORCE .How would USA feel if Russia starts to join forces with USA Neighbours ???I don't understand why USA/NATO had to build defensive forces on Russia Neighbouring Countries .Face the consequence now 🤦
Guys,YaH The Heavenly FATHER HIMSELF was Who they Crucified for our sins and “HERE IS THE PROOF”From the Ancient Semitic Scroll: 
We are all in this together
 @Andrew Walton  Yeah because this is his fault wtf 😂
We support Ukraine 🇺🇦🇦🇿😥
 @zoro zoro  You don't understand why Nato put troops on the borders? Well back in 2014 Russia annexed chrimea so all the other baltic states got worried Russia was going to do the same to them so they asked Nato for help, it seems pretty simple to me mate. If Ukraine wants to be a part of Nato then they should be allowed to, Russia doesn't have anything to worry about because they said they weren't going to attack Ukraine and its not like putin is going to lie is it......
Even soldiers' lives matter.
Come russia ..move on ..🔥🔥🔥 usa,nato,un all mfks was doing blw jb with Israel while israrel was invading Palenstine and now the usa,nato,un is moaning like a ditch for a russia ..and also Ukraine supported israrel to invade Palenstine ... And also so called nato is surrounded russia that's why russia is taking good step .. and daring step 🔥🔥
 @Ukraine for life  and you using the situation news for gain subscribers ... 😏😂
they are being bombed . unfortunately they are not safe. horrific!
where have your hearts been for the past 8 years while western backed fourth reich gangs attacked east ukranians? The BBC are a state funded terrorist cartel!
 @Rhys Shaughnessy  Russia will Never allow NATO force near it's borders it's against National Security .We will make sure to protect our National Security 🙏 If USA wants war come and get it .. we are not scared of 3rd world war or let this earth be broken into pieces we don't care .But will make sure no foreign forces established their base on the borders of Russia .
I dont think anyone is safe

Prayers for the people of Russia
the comedian president is provoking war by inviting nato to russian dootstep.
KR support UR
I hope that Putin gonna rip ukraine apart
As the politicians start the wars, they hide in Their bunkers protecting themselves why the innocent citizens deal with the consequences... I just wish the people would wake up & see the bigger picture.. We are better off without Politics.

 @Bruhski  no.... I hate u pussys who lie
 @Dutch Van der Linde  ✊
gogogogo russia, send nuclear
 @Дед Мазай  maybe because Russia occupied the cities and they wanted to retake control since it was part of their country?
 @Дед Мазай  also that never happened, Russia was bombing Donetsk to kill the soldiers protecting the city
I swear the comments amount of salt
 @Дед Мазай  You forgot to change name
Nobel Peace Committee are you seeing this?? This is what happens when you give Peace prize to a politician. Now Mr. Putin wants to show to the world who is the actual keeper of peace or on whose shoulders the peace lies safely in Europe. May be you should consider giving Mr. Putin a peace prize. Or a joint peace prize to Mr. Biden and Mr. Putin but that will surely bring Mr. Trump into picture and you should answer him as to why he should not be given the peace prize. So committee, in view of so many families being affected you should revise your policies...I wonder if a prize return from his rival politician will satisfy Mr. Putin's ego...
Russia gonna f u up
 @wricovy_  no u
Россия 🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
 @wricovy_  Children from Syria wondered how come children from other countries don't know of war planes.. they are as regular as a bird in the sky to them.. this is how war can affect the future...
 @bigmanv  can never  sympathize with the nazis . Sorry .
 @mr g  be quite your not making any sense.
 @Nguyễn Cương Lĩnh 綱領  putin gave a LITERAL blood and soil speak to justify what he is doing. He's literally a fascist with nazis in his own group... he literally gave you the reason WHY he was invading and it had nothing to do with what your saying
 @Дед Мазай  exactly when Russians were being hurt no one cared but when Russians are hurting people now every is so worried. Just shows how biased the world is
 @Andrew Walton  how is this his fault?
 @zoro zoro  exactly like how would the US feel is Russia put their army in Canada, Mexico, Cuba, Bahams etc
 @zoro zoro  Ukraine isn't a part of nato? And you cant feel for something that is and was never going.to.happen.Like I don't get the whataboutisms
This is what Biden  said about Putin before he was elected:
 @MIT Mathematica0101  now y'all care about covid lol
 @Lunar Eclipse  - is your ignorance drug induced or do you just lactate ignorance naturally for a living?
Common bully Putin, give some nuke to that Ukraine, if you think you're powerful.
 @Nguyễn Cương Lĩnh 綱領  Funny that, I just checked,  russia never brought any complaint to the United Nations about it, in the history of the Ukraine, the only report that stud out was from Amnesty International that claimed Russia were backing separatists during a cease fire in 2014, were civilians were being tortured and murdered by gorilla groups all funded and armed by putin.
No. They aren't safe at all and a heart emoji probably isn't helpingEstimated at least tens of thousands of innocent Ukrainians will die
If you have anyone is Ukraine get into contact with me and we can evacuate them to poland
 @Ted Hibbard  Putin is orthodox, not catholic 🤦‍♂️. Shows how little you know about Russia.
Does your heart include the ethnic russians in Donbass (Ukraine) that have been fired at for 8 years by the ukrainian army and slowly starved to death by cutting power, water, food supplies, financial services?
 @DemonicCODM  But for some reason, no one provided a video that there was a Russian army in the Donbas. And why is there such a panic now if Ukraine has been successfully at war with Russia for 8 years? Is it because the Russian army has really come to help the residents of Donbass now?For 8 years in the Donbass, the Ukrainian army has been killing its own citizens, citizens of Ukraine, who were ethnic Russians. They were killed only because they disagreed with the illegal coup in 2014. They declared their independence. If you shift the situation to Europe, for example. It's just like Catalonia would vote for independence, and the Spanish army would bomb Barcelona with planes and heavy artillery. And all this just because they participated in the referendum.
 @Дед Мазай  yeah I wonder why as well.
 @Kirk Terrace  exactly. Even if you hope something bad doesn't happen,that doesn't exactly give any extra odds that nothing bad will happen. Just facts.
 @Darrell Moore  we don't need your fantasy ass up in here,the heavenly lord ain't doing shit for anyone right now,so why believe he exists?
 @21 Gang  lol.
🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
Because America and nato are the destroyers of this war, look at what has happened before, America is a coward who dares to attack, America is the destroyer of this world, facts, Read the history first. Ukraine used to be, what in Ukraine were mostly ethnic Russians, Russia had to protect its people from western Europeans, Mamarika and Natos
NATO should NUKE russia before its too late, this is just the start of world domination
Man... this is what i was talking about. Humanity might go even more downhill at this point... Russia starting this damn war that can easily turn into a big one like last world war and even worse we have higher nuclear power weapons... things can. And i hope not. Get very bad. I hope this only stays like this between Russia and Ukraine only because it can spark a world war. And man it can be even worse than the last time... and i get that biden maybe wants to help fight Russia... but than again things can turn even worse. Maybe things might get worse no matter what you do sometimes. But take care and stay safe everyone
Y can't ukarinegovernment or the ppl just give Putin the land. Putin seems very wise. His ppl respect him.Or at least get the residents out of there to other neighbour countries.
 @George Cher  Putin looks like the only wise kind president in the world. God look after the whole world.
I think the west news isn't telling public truth...the reason y Putin is doing it..he protecting the world from the west. I don't trust Biden at all or other president's .
 @Wilfredo Gomez  nice joke kid the US military is a joke
Your heart only goes to the civils?dude what about the ukrainian soldiers, They do their best to defend their country and civils..
BBC reporter's words are farts
 @George Cher  Europe the continent? You talk about it like it’s a country. Haha.
​ @Hagz Tanz  not anymore. millions, if not billions refuse to put up with this any longer. most of us support and stand with Ukraine.
Zelensky is too naive and are barking at the wrong door. Be like Afghans, they defeated Russia, the US, and NATO.

Unless Ukraine pointed their nuclear weapons (that they don't even have right now) at Moscow INVASION IS NOT ACCEPTABLE! Don't blame a victim! It's not girl's fault that she was raped - no matter how short her dress was.
Ironic isn't it? Russia invades Ukraine on the same day the people's convoy begins. How fortunate for let's go Brandon. Strange.....
What a degenerate is Putin...just like Milosevic in Ex-Yugoslavia...stay strong Ukraine...support from Croatia.
Another rich man's war supported by a Fake MSM. I can't believe that the Sheep still buy this 
If we didn't have a 20 year based on lies other countries would have respected us
so putin is saying that if ukrain have war armor then russia is in trouble and is defending themselevs? makes no sense
8 years people of Donbas dying from ukrainian artillery and mortars. American media not shown this, because scared. Now, Putin decided to defend people of Donbas. Fired to ukrainian artillery and control centers.
Ww3 👍
This is just like normal monday in Palestine
This is it Putin has made his move and now the free world must rise up against this act of aggression
NATO zionist regimes should have listened.
Support Ukraine from India... God be with you.
WTH where are all the countries who promised to help?! I can't believe this is happening!
Exactly what western leaders where praying for cuz they always win in war
I'm so happy this happenedHumanity is bad World should suffer
10min video for a short clip, really?
This is when a sick man got the power.
F**k russia .😡😡😡😠😠🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕
There is no purgatory for criminals of war. There is only hell.
Evil evil evil devil 😈 u can't win Jehovah shall judge u all , praying for Ukraine 😢🙏🙏🙏
For every 1 anti Russian person the bbc interview on the street I can assure you that they won’t show you the other 99 Ukrainian people who are pro Russia that they interviewed.BBC = the propaganda network
Let's stop traveling all russian to all democratic countries.they need to stand up against their president Putin .,🇸🇰🤝🇺🇦
I doubt the overwhelming majority of Russians dont support this mission, really do.  It all depends on the age of, size of and where rhe sample size of the population is polled.   US doesnt want Russia at their doorstep, see Bay of Pigs, but yet Russia is supposed to accept UKR to NATO so that the west can be at theirs?  Nonsense.
You'd think that with the months of 
kupie opony do żuka
Its over,,, the ukranian army has surrendered,, pack up and go Zelensky you have been a disaster for Ukraine, where is your US and NATO friends now?
When the rich wage war its the poor that die
Putin a real devil
How grateful I feel to live in a peaceful country and have never had to face war!
Weak men create hard times. Thank you president Biden.
it's like three hours flight from the UK to Ukraine its too close we don't want war in Europe. We need to talk sense into these politicians!
So Belarus is fair game?
Wtf is happening
bhagavan hii bachayaga inko . hey god pls help these peason
As a human being that grew up under NATO bombs, I can't believe the level of hipocricy I'm seeing all around. I do not wish war to anyone, but what did Ukraine expect after ignoring Russia for over 7 years... You took Biden's money, now eat Biden's shit.
Putin is just playing words as excuse for invasion. He has damaged his reputation to the world. Now NATO should play different game and China will assess his plans for Taiwan. Heavy sanctions should now be underway from Europe and USA.
Hopefully all the Russian equipment is as old as Puptins phones.
This taking of power is unjustified, once they take this they will take it all.
Does Putin has a human heart. May God fight for Ukraine.
THIS IS THE RESULT of the criminal politics of USA, UK aand OTAN !!! This is the goal you were looking for.  You have armed the nazi AZOV and PRAVI SECTOR  regiments, ... you have armed your puppet Zelensky.  Now you have obtained your goal.  What do you think to do???
putins lost his mind...this is scary....
That's what you get when you bad mouth Russia and spread covid radical extremism. It's much better to be good neighbors than adopt Nazi like covid restrictions and mandates on people. KARMA has a way of doing justice who ever it may be.
This guy is evil
The US will now bring the UFO technology, just watch
Nazi's started 🥺
Praying for all Ukraine sending you all so so much love please please please stay safe all of you 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺💙💙💙💙 we stand with Ukraine 🇺🇦🇺🇦
America UK please help Ukraine for us.
That’s what communist do.
told y'all not to join nato
Pray for Ukrainian people and Russian people 🤲🤲
Ukraine had time to prepare how did they not expected this  ? No air defence ?
Putin is really a coward who hides behinds his weapons. He wouldn't cross any major European country or the US but economically and militarily devastated Ukraine.
I live near Polish-Ukrainian border....you don't even know how terrible I feel because I can only watch it. I see fire in the Ukrainian forest.  People are dying and Russian propaganda on the main news channel there said: UKRAINE ATTACKED FIRST.... Nightmare is really happening.
I am not religious but Putin will go to hell.
Ula
My allah help you my allah protect you all Ukraine human coming NATO and europeo Union protect Ukraine human coming NATO and europeo Union attack Russia
Mr  zenelky,  you  don't  deserve  this position,   go back  as a comedian,  you are  responsible  for suffering  of Ukrainian
🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
Ukraine I know you can't but try your best to take out EVERY Russian solder like the trash they an there leader are. Feed them to whatever wants to eat them.
War is coming
wish people was this sympathetic to the people in Middle East that's been suffering this for years
Leaders please speak with mind, heart and pen. Stop speaking with guns.
HOW CAN PUTIN SAY ITS SELFDEFENCE  ? HE IS THE ONE STARTED ALL THIS IN THIE FIRST PLACE   SO SURELY IT SHOULD BE THE OTHER WAY ROUND  I WAS RIGHT  PUTIN HAS GONE NUTTY A SCREW LOOSE  HE IS GOING LIKE HITTLER  AND IF IT CARRYS ON WE ALL GOING TO COP FROM HIM  HITTLER HAD A SONG WE MADE UP LIKE HITTLER HAS ONLY 1 BALL  NOW WE GOT TO THINK OF A SONG  FOR SCREWY PUTIN
This man is a monster 👻 👽
Wipe. Out Russia once & for all
Weeks and weeks of NATO pouring in war materials and machine to ukraine and yet they couldnt even counter the airstrikes using air defense arsenals. NATO is just a show off but no force😆
Just like Afghanistan Ukraine is weak army...
Prayers to the Ukrainian people 🙏
If Russia want to have a great economy,If Ukraine doesn’t want it’s country destroyed,If The West don’t want a new Cold War and risk of Nuclear war,Then they all should give up parts of their depends and stop this madness. NATO can’t say they won’t say Ukraine won’t join NATO.Russia can’t say they will continue this military operation,And Ukraine can’t say they have the right to join NATO. And the war stops and Ukraine’s infrastructure is not destroyed and Ukrainian will have the life they deserve which is not this.
支持乌克兰🇺🇦，远离邪恶的俄罗斯人🇷🇺。
#pray4Ukraine
🇷🇺🇨🇳 ✌️
And Rest of the world is watching , and they don’t care about what happen to civilians,  such a smart game by world power .shame ,shame .
Well we got rid of the mean tweets and all it cost us was everything.
Stay strong ukraine. I understand russia for not putting trust in nato specially in us but it is wrong to pick a fight with so called brother in many years its very wrong. Please take care citizens of ukraine from philippines.
Freedom is the right to own a mustang  GT  in Ukraine .
my question is Where are the NATO countries? Wy they do not not help?
Russias security concerns were ignored by the West, this is the language NATO and US speak
US and NATO will not send troops to Ukraine that would start WW3 and it would be a disaster for Europe
ur ukrainian president is defending u from shells and missile attacks .. goodluck with that
“No fighting in the war room”
Corona is not enough for these people
Russian: I have a neighbor, he don't want to be friends with me, I don't feeling safe, so I break in his house and kill him, I do this for self defense.
FALSE FLAG BULLSHIT
This will recoil on Putin.
🙏🏻heart goes out to Ukraine 🇺🇦. #stopwar
This is really sad.. Romania and Poland should take as many refugees they can, I don't think Moldova is a safe destination...maybe putin will go there next after ukraine since moldova it's not a nato country either
GO RUSSIA VERY MUCH LOVE. RESPECT and SUPPORT FROM ROMANIA. 🇷🇺❤️🇷🇴.Don't allow these terrorists (NATO) to get you down. We, those who still think independently and do not believe everything that propaganda says, are on your side and we are all over the world.
as Ukrainian and my family near Kiev we hide in a bunker and we literally leaving every 2 hours outside of the bunker for some wi fi just so we can contact our close friends and our families, yet its scary to go out every 2 hours just for like 10 minutes of wi fi ...
And so it begins 😓
Yes! Where US, and NATO now, only we 
President Putin did the right thing he cant allow his enemies sneaking at his back yard
this is what you get if you do not pay your gas bill ontime
Russia has given Ukraine a pretty good reason to finally join NATO.
This is heart touching..supporting Ukraine from Somalia 🇸🇴
Russia has now shown it's teeth & has become the worlds Satan, no hiding it. Putin uses the word 
Afghans be like first time?
As an American, I wish we had a show of strength there.  Just so you didn't feel alone.
 @Thung67  Americans “helped” many other countries in past as well and honestly they never helped🤷‍♂️
Good
A V is probably a Russian or chinese bot. Just look at his comments or profile.
I know it won't help much, but lots of love from Cape Town , South Africa. We think of you in your crisis
 @Ender Lain  I’m not a bot g 😂 I got a heartbeat
Thier are many somalian supporting UkraineDon't know why
Afghans fought off a Soviet and US invasion and sent both militaries packing
NATO and USA no balls
Hey women that wants equal rights and pay go fight in the war and the men stay back
Just like what they did on 08.08.2008 with Georgia.. I hope Putin rots in hell one day. Nothing but an absolute nazi!!
Putin wants war but his soldiers dont.
WW3 under way just waiting for the 2nd sun to bloom.
World War III just started
What? This is the war for gas, oil , etc initiated by anglo-saxons long time ago. And we know it very well..
Putin will spend the rest of his days fearing this same end.  It will be interesting to see him in another six months
💙🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦💛
What's the purpose of NATO?
The reporter went underground showed and said it was soldiers there……. Uhhhh underground wouldnt be safe anymore now they know where the threat lies. That man is working with them. Lol smart man get ya money no organic get that monnnet
Putin war never solution
Praying for Ukraine 🙏🙏 I hope Russian President change his mind. Because no one suffer from this war only the innocent people
Praying for iraq,syria and Palestine ❤🧎‍♂️✝️🛐
Guys in comment show a big love for Ukraine and happy for Israel the Zionist attacking Palestine the hypocrisy on it's peak
Where are all the feminist in ukraine?
No it won’t be ww3, it is a war of Ukraine liberation by Russia! Please always remember 🇷🇺🇨🇳always together and together we are stronger than USA!
only to bomb smaller countries, but against a nuclear power US and NATO are scared like dogs
Iraq is safe now
All loving democratic countries should unite n oppose putin.. he is a mad dog now...
This is Biden's fall from his stupidity and weakness
It's all America's fault. The United States has waged war. America is fanning the flames of war. The United States has killed millions of innocent people in the name of terrorism. I think the whole world should boycott America.
In put things in perspective, doesn't it? This is real war, not some flu virus
bro, the tanks went to Lugansk and Donesk not another ukraine territory
Putin is a mad dog.
Everyone says we stand with Ukraine, yet these cowards do nothing to help them besides give them weaponsAnd ammunition. NATO is a joke
It is unbelievable that NATO and the United States now do nothing ,before the war they say they support Ukraine.
Well he would die, u can’t stop the Russians. It’s not a nato or EU member, so sending troops would mean not assistance it means war with Russia
When will the people learn the lessonDon't trust or 🤝 with 👉🇺🇸
God bless Putin ♥️
If only Ukraine had been quicker to join NATO.
When this is over, I want to watch Zelenskiy saw Putin’s head off taliban style on national television.
I can’t look at Putin without feeling disgust. He is taking advantage because many countries do not want to go to war. He is basically testing the grounds to see what he can do without being stopped. It’s disheartening seeing Ukraine like this, shame on Putin for creating chaos after COVID was done. Shame on him for thinking that losing lives is far more important for his political agendas.
Two rotten corrupt regimes calling the other side nazis. If ever we had proof that calling someone a nazi has lost all currency this is it.
Stay strong Ukraine.
We stand with russia
not really US invaded and bombed Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, FR yugoslavia etc. US are equally as mad,
Putin out of his f'n, why the f is scared at a country that's a quarter of its size!?!
Putin is a psychopathic Lier!!!
God bless the USSR!
At 2:46 and 2:51.Is that the PAK-FA T-50 and MIG-29 Fulcrum flying at the city of Ukraine?!
Why does the BBC sound more and more like a mouthpiece and less like a news organization?8:14, they did an independent poll and most Russians supported this War
This is the dawn of something greater.
Putin´s concept of self-defense is out of date. Applying Putin´s concept of ´self-defense´ all big Russian blokes around the world ought to be set upon by the local people before they kick off!
Airport? Why civilian buildings. That's very bad and signs of unprofessional Army
My heart's broken for Ukraine.It's like a big boy (Russia) fighting a small boy (Ukraine).
Well BBC you finally got your war.Hope you're happy now.
Who will fight for NATO ? Germany‘s interest in this is   zero.  The same for France. Britain is just babbling with big words.  None of these countries will send soldiers. Old unused weapons to Ukraine. And BBC and CNN are misleading the whole world by their cock and bull stories.
#forabolsonaro
I hope everyone crushes russia
Remember what you british and americans have done to the Iraq, libya Anf afghanistan
🇷🇺♥️🇪🇹
Black Kitty ASMR lives there.  She can make Putin go to sleep
Good 👍.   Fuck Biden and usa 🇺🇸 hope Russia 🇷🇺 does them all in. Fuckin trash 🗑 idiots
Putin will pay dearly. Might take some time but he’ll receive the same send off as Mussolini
People are been killed while NATO is quiet and doing nothing so sad. 😥😔My heart goes to all Ukrainians 🇺🇦🇺🇦😥😥🙏🙏🙏stay strong
Give Peace a Chance. What's so hard about a chance? What are we doing here on Earth? What's the point to all this nonsense ? Ppl with power are insane
You mean like when Nato attacked Yugoslavia or Irak Or Afghanistan or Syria somting like that? Or weare not talking about those things, just asking for a friend
 @smith Don  It only matters when it’s the other way around I guess
Thanks for clarifying who was the big and who was the small
 @smith Don  NATO is the villain playing the hero, Russia is the villain playing the villain. There are no good guys in all this tbh. I just wish the civilians in Ukraine didn’t have to get caught in a cross fire of a conflict which is ultimately between the idiots who call themselves leaders in the west and Russia.
 @Thunderbug   me 2 Man hopefully there we be smolier amount of civilian casualties,bat let's be honest here they don't have a chance I mine Ukrainia . The smartest thing for civilians is to not fall on the calls to take guns from piople how well run away whit the money and have nice life's in some other country. And to be honest how fast is happening I think the Ukrainian military have make a dill whit Russia I think they to don't like the president (actor)  and the paramilitary groups
not really
They want to avoid an international incident and WW3
 @Wolverine123  there is nothing like avoiding, Russia has already declared war and NATO thinks by giving economic Sanctions will do anything.Humanity is vanishing, I only cry for those Ukrainian children 😥,how they are feeling right now inside is just painful 🙏🙏🙏
Madness of power we have seen before as well Israel invaded Palestine , China took over Taiwan , India taken over Kashmir , but what happen only innocent lives suffered.
Putin madness
Go to hell Putin!!!!
Nice!!!
If only 
Reminder that ukraine is a corrupt puppet regime that is in the pocket of the demons that run USA.
How long until uk and other countries r asked to sign up and fight???
Vamos destruir a Rússia 🇷🇺
This is very sad. Innocent people get hurt because someone is insecure about the size of his pencil. Ukrainian people, please stay as safe as you can under these circumstances. Much love.
war will be the last thing that russian people will want kremlin amasses wealth by corruption whereas the burnt is borne by the people
Leaving yet or they still celebrating there peace day ?
and noone is going to help ukraine to  stop this tiran shame on NATO  and USA
Ffs man!!!
Putin? What's wrong with you??? What go inside your mind? The devil.
Praying for Ukrainians..
putin is litterly hitler hope Ukraine are okay ❤
you started this.
Peace from Chile make love not war
Russians are a proud and intelligent people, plus this whole region is very complex, so it's naturally going to create a fog of war. I hope the dust settles fast and with few casualties!
Comunistas desgraçados
Kashmir is already a part of India. Dont believe in Western propoganda channel
Kashmir should be free, India took them over by force in 1947.
Putin is going to liberate ukrainais don’t worry. Everything is going to be amazing.
Stop this war nooob come custom 1 v 1 ...in mobile legend
My sister is in Ukraine now :-( I am hoping she can get out safely.
Ukraine president didn’t want to believe when USA had gave them heads up about being attacked! Now believe it. 50 plus Soldiers had die and y’all can’t even get one
Putin 💪✊✌️
Why? Many people gonna die cuz of 1 wicked person.
so NO ONE can get to Putin ..... and take HIM out of the equation
propaganda from both sides is nauseating.  Remember that the US wanted to make Ukraine a nato ally which means they want to put US military base  right next to Russia.  Just immagine what would happen if Mexico agreed to a Russian base on its north border next to the US territory, the Americans would nuke the Mexicans.
I am so sorry for all the Ukrainian people. Im not effected by this war, but i iterally have tears in my eyes.
Don't force Ukraine into NATO especially when it's dealing with a civil war and is unstable. Also allow Russia and Europe to have Nord Stream 1 and 2 and stop being jealous!
Ukraine was owned by Russia for hundreds of years and, gifted to Ukrainians so they might prosper. When it was gifted it came with a strong agreement it would never join NATO  or  acquire Nuclear weapons  . Both agreements were being broken by Ukrainian leaders. NOT ACCEPTABLE!  Since 1991 14 territory's next TO Ukraine have joined NATO. By all rights Russia should re-occupy  Ukraine entirely.
whwere r russian troops?
I think it’s best for Ukrainian to surrender to many innocent lives may be lost if this continues but my heart goes to the Ukrainian people 🇺🇦from  🇺🇸
Never even made it to the video just a bunch of advertisements some dude putting on makeup and some other dude seeing what's in his butt I mean nothing but commercials
I hope it going to be quick end and very less casualties.
NATO(ROTHSCHILD) BETRAYED UKRAINE
How is it self defense by invading a another country
Fuck Russia
Those is so disgusting and appalling on so many levels. The poor innocent people. Putin is a pig
Guess what, there are already NATO bases right next to Russia and their puppet Belarus... You need to stop drinking the russian koolaid. It justifies nothing.
Get ready ..cos we will all be affected very soon
The war will come to the whole world soon.
 @Martin K  except for africa and south America
Not yet
 @O'Connor  time to move to Argentina
🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
Welcome to WW3. You're not affected yet but you will be. We all will be.
War? Seems more like bullying😂😂
We will all be affected. Covid was the start.
m2 i am watching live stream with friends not for the sensation but hoping for news that the russians are losing.
Why was there not so much sympathy and emotion when the Ukrainian army bombed Donetsk and Lugansk for 8 years?
You are affected… you just don’t know it yet.
 @Дед Мазай  Because few in the West were even aware that was happening.
Where were your tears when USA and NATO bombed Afghanistan , Iraq , Syria and Libya ?
Cringe
 @El Cid  meanwhile whole of the Asia , Middle east and majority of the South America wants Russia to win . They want The NATO shit show and terrorism to end.
 @Zarrar 9  shut the f*** up how would you like to lose your cereal and Saturday morning cartoons p**
 @Linux user  il go with you
My grandma is there I am crying right now
Dummy WW3 is everywhere unless it underground stupid
Oh yes you are! If you live in the US, look at the market today. I work for a financial service company and I’m getting ready for all the financial panic today…
You are lying
 @Dan Mann  not even close to a world war America not doing anything no other country’s are with Russia on this u idiots saying ww3 needa stfu and get educated y’all think they gonna start a large invasion there not Putin won’t risk soilders lives for that he trynna take part of Ukrainian to cripple them economically and make them bow to Russia and America has made it clear we’re not sending soldiers to Russia get it straight kid
It’s gonna spread… time to head for the hills from the city’s
But we all will be affected by this war globally definitely in means of global grief, food and gas shortages or inflated costs, but more importantly the loss of human kind.
 @Daz Slater  these dumbasses saying ww3 pissing me off and just shows people needa learn more bout “war”
That's so naïve to say, it will affect* you. (An effect is noun, affect is a verb. The >effect< of this war will eventually >affect< you.)
 @Zarrar 9  you are right we should tear when dicators like Saddam Hussein, Gaddafi etc die or terrorist like Taliban, IS, osama bin laden
 @ImPresSiveXD  stop Imposing your Satancracy on other Nations. By your Logic Russian are doing the same against evil regime siding with The Western fascists.
Shud hv tears for ppl of palestin who for decade doesnt hv the media to report about them
 @Suraya ji  Exactly. Our news here is completely biased and it just shows us whatever narrative our governments wants us to believe. And people feel like they're too busy and stressed to deep dive into everything and do research into the affairs ourselves.
Even if WW3 doesn't break out, gas prices worldwide are gonna go brrrrrrr
We will be, when Russia stops the gas supply to EU. Will be terrible for the economy.
 @Warped Sounds  3heli
 @Daz Slater   You think the death of innocent people is a laughing matter?  Trash
 @Zarrar 9   Most people globally cared deeply. Because people are not the USA government and Nato.
 @Flowers of Edo    Let's all stop and pause for English lessons and  btw your reply shows a bit of naivete as well..
No humans are always greedy from every walk of life.
Putin is a bully and a fool.
🇸🇰🇪🇺✌️🌼❤️🇺🇦
Pray for Ukraine
....No mention of Nord Stream 2 pipeline then BBC? What a shocker.
this is all started cause the USA
At this point a revolution I needed in Russia to stop this Putin tyrant
Putin is a devil that needs to be put down.
Putin, is a hitler power monger. It's 2022, this sort of thing should not be happening.
Some say Biden is to blame.
Long prayed for Peace, They were fighting for 8 years.....................  It's a disgrace
🧲🧲🧲Praying for Russia ✌️Hope Russia will win soon ✌️The big match is coming soon NATO vs Russia ❤️✌️We want US & NATO empire defeat 👎
World people need peace peace peace pls stop war for alitte of Lana or something china and pak they are cheaters they want like control the all world ( imran also think all world convert to muslim country
it is really pathetic to  see people's sad  and concern face.
My love is for the Ukrainian people and soldiers. Respect for Ukrainian soldiers who lost their life in this conflict. There will always be an Angel guiding and guarding you Ukrainian soldiers when you are fighting Russian army or separatist group.
Russia you have just declared war on the Ukraine and America. Good luck Idiot!
We hope bbc will also report nato war crimes in iraq syria . Libya Yemen Afghanistan . Israel bombing on Palestine . Bbc hypocrisy
If russia backs hezbollox then russia will see real terrorism
Zyklon B Vladimir Putin
Satan waiting Putin to hell
Back off putin😠😡
Pretty sure there aren't any soldier deaths yet
 @Ae  From the news, there have been 40 deaths of civilians.They didn't mention soldiers.
https://youtu.be/zFJ2AN_CZH8
Brave Ukrainian soldiers? They have been murdering their own people in the donbass region for 8 years while Western media turned a blind eye. You know nothing about whats been going on in ukraine. You dont understand why this is happening now but yet here you emerge with an opinion? The ignorance of the masses makes me sick to my stomach. You think our politicians give a damn about these people? They caused this problem in the first place in order to dump russias gas pipeline project. Where are they now? Offer strong condemnation and threaten sanctions but happily let ukraine fight russia down to the last Ukrainian for their own selfish interests. Hopefully the Ukrainian people will be rid of this pro US puppet regime soon thanks to vladimir putin

 @Dicky  that’s good
Ukraine is not a NATO member, US has no business getting involved.
NATO should back off first
 @Wolverine123  what the hell is the war solution

Seem a good place to make tik tok video
Putin calling Ukrainians nazis yet He’s being hitler
Canada to mobilize 25,000 troops for war effort
This world will never learn, and will never learn till ww100, A human is dangerous
2:39  they have mustangs??
😰😰
I feel for the citizens of Ukraine 🇺🇦, but I hold politicians of Ukraine for not being wise to make decisions to protect their citizens. It is stupid to listen to people far from you and go into a conflict with your neighbors..in this case Ukraine and Russia...American are not in such a situation that Ukrainian are facing now....Why follow such path?

A Jewish fellow like Zelensky calls Ukraine his country?
Goddamn idiots
Some are very smart Goebei's students.
BBC Propaganda
Karma
all western leaders are uncercomomisiz and has no ball's to confront Putin
STOP wasting time. REPENT AND TURN TO GOD. No human government can solve any problems. It will only get worse. The ruler of this world is satan, this is why there is so much suffering.  Salvation is through Yeshua, the son of the only true God, Yahuah who is the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. THERE IS NO OTHER WAY. FOCUS MORE ON THE KINGDOM OF GOD. SEEK GOD NOW BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.
Utterly, NATO has been strategically wrong in confronting Russia utilizing and shielding with the Ukraine's internal crisis🤔All the World leaders 👣💪🔄💪 constructive peace talks between 🇷🇺🇺🇦 . God bless the Ukrainians and all the European nations💐
Don't trust Russia they lied they no what they want I just feel so sorry for Ukraine  good look and let God be on your side 🙏
Ukrainian people should get rid of Zelenesky, just like Previous one
this is why aliens don't visit us, we primitives still fight and kill eachother after 200.000+ years for some dirt  I know ukraine was part of Russia in the past. but so what? its's not like ur some small country where I live Belgium ...
The best thing for Ukraine to do is overthrow Zelensky and declare themselves militarily neutral like before
F
Russian stocks plunged! Yay bring them to their knees. Crush Russian!
The sanctions wont mean anything which is the sad thing. They're so deep in every government. Trumps government, probably Biden's and boris Johnsons as well as many others. Russia isolated themselves from USD and other currencies so it wont mean anything with the banks. Russia has a grasp on the entire world.
Welcome to 1939 all over again.
For the last 1000 years Russia was never a good neighbour. 🇵🇱
My heart goes out to the people of Ukraine for the monstrous events they are now living through 🇺🇦
Tell that to the 100,000 iraqis civilians,  who were killed in the war on Saddam. The Ukrainian government are Nazis, they are Fascists. Fact
It's going to be a long bloody war if this warmongers aren't out of power
I would like to ask this Journalist which coutry civilians want war against another nation?
They dispare in the voice of the president of Ukraine just broke my heart and every minute that goes by is another minute someone can be killed! 😱💔💯😪😪😪😪🙏🙏🙏
Russia is out of their god damn minds
So bias news... lol
It is difficult to believe someone would start a land war in 2022. It’s barbaric.
With all their military strength, the West hands are tied. Playing by the rules.... while Putin acts with impunity.
Für den Westen und Nato-Idioten, ist die Ukraine Geschichte.Ich hoffe, das danach die Mitgliedschaft des Baltikums in der scheiß Natoein Ende findet. Das geht mit Krieg und dagegen macht die Nato nichts,denn Russland ist die stärkste und effizienteste Atommachtund das ist gut so.Russland muß die Nato aus dem Baltikum vertreiben, da gibt es keineAlternative, es sei, das Baltikum kündigt die Nato-Mitgliedschaft und zwar sofortTut sie das nicht, riskieren sie die völlige Vernichtung. Sie haben die Wahl,Krieg mit aller Härte, oder Frieden mit Russland, dazwischen gibt es nichts.   Wobei auch hier, die Vertreibung derNato-Idioten, in 5 Tagen Geschichte sein wird.
Nazification? Pretty sure you just pulled an Adolf Hitler, Puny Putin
Any evidence for that?
OMG
Terrible time to joke, but did the girl at 7:45 not look like one of the Beatles?!

Says the Russian bot.
So is US bombing of Yugoslavia, invasion of Iraq, Vietnam and many other countries or is that okay

IKR! Why won't they use drones instead to kill whole families from some office's comfort? Have they not learn anything from the US? Barbaric indeed!
 @Orpheus Prime  you cant take land with drones though
FREEMASONIC agenda..new world order planned ages ago
In Europe of all places as well
 @Orpheus Prime  keep fallacies and diverting topics to support russia the big baddie 💀
People never change
 @Why are you reading this  True. But you use them to clean 
 @THE DUDE  please shut up, just for a few years
Boris wouldn’t hesitate to do it either if we were allowed to get away with it politically. He’s cut from the same cloth as Putin.
You realize there was a whole ass world war only 80 years ago, that’s still just one lifetime, conflicts can pop off anytime.
How else do you think a war works?
 @S W  Putin is a  freemasonicJesuit/ plenty proof..just like trump.biden..borris..ect ect.
 @Orpheus Prime  or you just fund an insurance group until they got strong enough to take over a region and then declare that region the insurance group as it own country and it under the protection of your nation.
Yamen has been at war with Saudia Arabia for a long time too...
 @S W  lol you think boris would able to declare war on some country without messing up, i love you confinement in the current Brexit UK government,  and this form government that cant even host a secret party without it leaking all over the new.
 @CoughoDemon  masonic shill..yous are losing.
 @khanh nguyen  borris is playing his role..as the clown..the fall guy..who destroyed UK as we know it.all planned .
SRBIJA,SIRIJA,LIBIJA,IRAK.......BBC🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫

Compare this with Serbia invasion of nato.
😥
All the USA and NATOs fault. Russia amd Ukraine are a family stop your bullshit
We love you Ukraine
Lame 😑
King Putin vs Queen Biden
Bias news report by BBC against Russian liberation of Ukrainians !
Putin has gone mad, this is not right
Nothing going on in karkiev according to someone in city video he showed me city was normal Russian forces got sent packing
Prelude to WW3
And i see in BBC the UK war . NATO should not have expanded if it didn't wanted a war  with Russia . When u cross red lines and enter bigger countries backyard then repecussions will be there. And Ukraine was thinking in false beleive that NATO CAN SAVE it from Russia. Every country has to fight his or her war ,so it shoud not bite more than it could chew by sitting in NATO lap
It's American fault world war 3 can happen. When the soviet union collapse. The Americans promise that they won't expand to the east. They cheat the Russian. That's why Russian are very angry. Now with the sanctions, everyone will suffer because of the rising price on fuel.This is what happen when America under Joe Biden. Donald trump is the right president.
Is nobody going to mention that the title has nothing to do with what happened in the video? Where's the airport? Where's the fireball?
from georgia, i will pray god to keep ukraine, and stay strong ukraine, georgia is with you!
Save all civilians.We want a peaceful world, no war
Notting different to what the US and Nato did to Libya and Iraq actually they totally flatten those two countries
I blame NATO and USA. When Ukraine announced Nuclear ambition the West were quiet. I feel for the Innocent Citizen.
Ukraine.... do not fight. Leave and keep your lives. Please.
Peacemaking includes blowing up an airport in Western Ukraine?
As an Afghan, my heart is broken for the people of Ukraine. This is exactly what's been happening to our country for the past 30-40 years. May God protect the innocent ones.People of Ukraine, remember no one is your friend nor West, nor Russia...
He hit the airport purposefully so that people couldn't leave easily.  How atrocious!? Prayers to the innocent victims and their families.
Propaganda News
That like hitting someone first then call it Self-defence, they are still mostly likely to hit you again.
Putin is murdering women and children. This is a travesty
What does one do with a snarling rabid dog?
Afghan. But it is captured by taliban. Btw how are you. From India
Yes but the Taliban is right?
Ive seen your comment somewhere
 @Mandalorian  ah yes because someone doesn't like the west they automatically like one the worst regimes. Very logical
 @Mandalorian  The Taliban are Afghans. I prefer those people fight with each other better than they fight against a Nuclear super power called The U.S.  The American Civil War was fought between the United States of America and the Confederate States of America, a collection of eleven southern states that left the Union in 1860 and 1861. The conflict was solved by Americans not by another country so know your position before asking such stupid question.
As an Afghan,you should know Allah.I just not quite understand  when Allah transforms to  a god.Can you  explane it please?
 @Tac Tac  alot of other countries were involved in the Civil War, including native nations.
 @Unbreaded  Lmao what no our civil war was just us. That's why the south lost so hard, can't get much supplies when the north was the one supplying.
 @slav  I am commenting everywhere because I am really heart broken. Millions died in Afghanistan because of these wars. West or East, none of them are your true friend. Everyone is looking for their own interests. And who suffers, the innocent people of Ukraine.May God protect the innocent children, women and men... AMIN!!
 @Trashboªt  nah, go read about it. The south was heavily aided by European nations
 @Tac Tac  England and France were asked to help but decided to remain neutral to both sides.
 @Unbreaded  And they still lost? Lmfao
 @Trashboªt  yep 😂😂👍
@Beydar one person who spoke real words.Only people who go through something horrific know real truth. Listen to them, don't be idiot and listen to government, they all lie. USA doesn't give a sh1t about Ukraine, they won't send one soldier there, only sell weapons to Ukraine, EU will try to help because their ass is on the platter as well, but Russia is too strong so they won't try hard. Nobody will give a damn shi7.Joke Biden warning about this for 2 weeks, west knew Russia is attacking, but still didn't call for g7 meeting before attack, work through options before is too late, now they doing something just for public.
I believe this is all planned by everyone, banks are real rulers of the world and monetary collapse is coming so they need to blame something, and it will be as always A WAR. Reset everything with war, as always.
Good advise, I think the whole world celebrated when US and Nato invaded Afghanistan. But now the whole world heart broken when Russia invading Ukraine. US destroyed whole country just to kill one man, Osama.   Nobody wins any war. We all are losers.
you say nobody is their friend but i think basically every other comment on this video proves that wrong
 @holo  friends aren't ones who wishes you luck or pray for you, that is called humanity, friend is someone who come and help you, and nobody is helping so far, and everyone said they will stand on side, UK, France, Germany, USA, everyone said they will not send military in Ukraine, just send read sell military equipment.Am I friend who feel sorry for innocent people, but still understand Putin?
 @Trashboªt  well Sherman basically just march right in the center of the conference and destroy all their train track, the south can have all the supply it want, but if they dont got the train track and train to deliver it to the fund it cant do squat
 @khanh nguyen  Yup, that's literally the dooms day of any southern expansion. The railroads.
U have no military knowledge, it was to prevent the Ukrainian air force from taking off
Siege of Kiev again 😏
It's a fault of NATO and USA
Lol
This is due to western folly.The west started it, Russia will finish it.
Lets go Brandon! Love and prayers for the people of Ukraine from the UK
BBC should have been criticise same manner when USA and UK destroy Libia , Iraq and Syria
I hope the Ukrainens military will give them a good beating... And I hope that they throw russia out of the UN and beat them like the crazy dog they are
I feel horrible for innocent lives that has nowhere to go😰😰😰
I don’t like war because here in my country🇦🇫I see the results of 40 years war 🥺🥺🥺🥺Praying for innocent people of Ukraine 🇺🇦
i love BBC
Shame on you Russia, it's time for civil war to kill your governement and install a real democracy, suka blyat
I can't believe this deranged unhinged tyrant has the cheek to talk about Nazis while killing innocent people. The west has to do more than imposing sanctions.  I hope the day comes when this tyrant pays for this slaughter of innocent people. And if you protest you get locked up.
Will Ukraine stand and fight?
Putin is Fascist and Neo-Hitler
To all Russians: Take this maniac down - all we need is a second Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg…….but this time more successful 🙏🙏🙏🙏
and so it began 💥
That's the end of humanity then I can only hope I'm asleep when the nukes hit Humanity is finished
My prayers are with Ukrainians, the book of Deuteronomy 20:4 says For the Lord your God is the one who goes with you to fight for you against your enemies to give you victory. Ephesians 6:13Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand firm2 Chronicles 20:15And he said, “Listen, all Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem and King Jehoshaphat: Thus says the Lord to you, ‘Do not be afraid and do not be dismayed at this great horde, for the battle is not yours but God's.
I feel like Ukraine will surrender 😭 bad for them
Putin is down right lying just like 45 an the GOP does an still do...they all lie with a straight face 🤬 I'm so angry for u all who have to live in this mess 💛💙
Who is Brandon?
European peace at stake, all because of one man’s ego! Russian’s need to stand up and throw that small minded moron out of power ASAP!
Don't die like chicken, defend yourself, your family and your land,  Russia should be hold responsible.
putin is only a thug
These NEO-con's are really something, It's a disgrace Ukraine didn't settle things peacefully with the Eastern territory for the past 8 years, which Russia did for them. Not to mention forbidding the use of Russian language. That's some way of 
So that's what peacekeeping looks like, bombs falling from the sky...
Blame our failed govt failed to protect Ukraine we all are to blame russia got the upper hand
How has this been allowed to happen????? Why were the Russian forces not met by overwhelming force by the world as they tried to cross the border? Have people learnt nothing from WW2? How has this not been stopped?????
To hll NATO burocracy, send the bloody troops now! It's about defending a fellow democratic state! Russia will not stop there! Send the troops for Odin's sake!
Those poor people. Doesn’t Putin have enough? The west isn’t interested in threatening Russia. The west has been embroiled in disastrous wars for the last 20 years. The Cold War ended more than 30 years ago. Russia would be fine if Putin didn’t keep flexing like a dick. Putin is a rabid dog for which there is only one treatment.
All we are saying....is give Peace a chance
lmao this world is so fabricated and fake, I'm amazed people still believe this shit. All wars are bankers wars, and banks own nations.
The United States supports ukraine
Bravo Russia 👍
at least they were warned before missile take out crucial places
I stand with Ukraine.
We Americans feel the same. We don't want to fight anymore.
it is the result of biased UN.
F you Russia and Putin
Belarus was in on this from the beginnings
With a big brother like Russia who needs a family.  Long live 🇺🇦. So much for your brotherhood rubbish Putin. Putin=🗑
Troops seem like sleepwalk get into Ukraine, no one stops them? US and NATO behind the TV screen?
Prayers to the Ukrainian people from the SANE section of USA that isn’t brainwashed by Tucker Carlson 🙏🏼
REMEMBER YUGOSLAVIA!!
Russia might gain land, but they will earn the ire of the entire world.
Now you heartless selfish understands how Palestinians are living in their own land against aggression of Israel.
From Turkey, we want peace, pls pls , Ukraine and Russia our friends, peace , no war
Russia a true leader. NATO is doomed. Western media never shows other side of Ukraine calling out on Russia to help them from Ukrainian military who killed many Russian speaking people
Absolutely heartbreaking that regular people have to live with this. I pray for them all the time. Humankind has an intelligence deficit, particularly among global leadership.
He realised if the Taliban can take a country,  he can take 2. Russia should of been delt with in the cold war
I pray from Myanmar. Fighting for your country never give you
noticed how fast those birds 🦅 was getting the hell out of there
I genuinely didn’t think they’d actually invade. Seems surreal
WTF
Dear people,rrIf you died tonight, would you be in heaven or hell?rrIf you’re not sure, and would like to know for certain, check out this short vid. God bless!rrhttps://youtu.be/6lzaPqKf2zs
អាមេខូចPutin
😥😥😥
Why no one says anything when Ukrainian army attacked and killed people in Lugansk and Donetsk?
leaders should go fight and not put civilian in danger, all of this for what? For their desires , stupid leaders!
Damn I am just amazed how good you are at making propaganda videos for USA and GB!!! Wooow
They dont have to live with this, each man and woman needs to grab a gun and fight.  If they wipe out russsian forces using gorilla tactics they can win but they have to do it themselves.

 @R6  why would anyone do something like that?
 @Tacito Zetticci  Self defense? Are you saying civilians should just not doing anything and therefore die?
Well, they did it before in 2014. Hopefully it will end soon with no further escalations, but the situation looks worse then ever unfortunately.
well now they have it becomes obvious that at least all of Europe is also under the same threat & it's essential the world unite & hold the line NOW!
To avoid being surprised, always assume the opposite of what the Russian government says.When Russia said in 2014 
what better way to get past a pandemic Good old invasion
 @The Be Sharp  they always lied in their history. Also they are protecting all the worse dictators in the world, you can expect them to do worse then them because they have the firepower.
Failed diplomacy of Biden. He forgot to act out of his Dementia.
'Horrifying Moment' Russian Bombs Drop All Over Ukraine https://youtu.be/ApuUWKuTJzw
 @The Be Sharp  - Well said
Xi's watching carefully..
Why not!? With the UNsmiling, emotionless Putin, I knew he would! He's heartless, just like his master, which is the devil!
Once boots are on the ground in Ukraine is when we should all be worried
 @shootfirst214  🙄🤒🥴🤨
 @A Şhah  Biden might not have had to negotiate if Trump or Boris hadn't allowed themselves to be bought for elections.
this is what happens when u bomb a country unprovoked. russia didnt start this. ukraine and usa did. biden has waited for this war since he took office.
 @Henry VIII  yeah
 @Cloudy McCloud  What do you mean? Do you mean actual Russian soldiers?
 @Henry VIII  did they  invade in 2014? On a scale like this ? I don’t think so, they are marching towards the capital
 @Kristoffer Pettersson  yes it started with Obama tbh, The US basically bended over Ukraine.... with the hunger for power. if that US had left it alone Russia wouldn’t have done anything
Ikr I can only guess that Putin got scared of Ukraine joining NATO so decided to act first
 @harrapino  Youre a fool
 @Daughter Of The Great I Am!  Yes actual Russian soldiers, not rebels, Russian Military boots on ground.
Me too. I am very dissapointed in Putin.
Putin is worse than a wild animal
https://youtu.be/thADhg3M3yIhttps://youtu.be/thADhg3M3yI🙂https://youtu.be/thADhg3M3yIhttps://youtu.be/thADhg3M3yI
You’re quite the optimist. Seemed obvious that invasion was Putin’s objective
What did you think they were going to do with the thousands of troops they lining up at the boarders? Of corse they were going to invade
How could you not....THAT seems unreal. We've had some very clear signs that this invasion would happen. Why are people so shocked now?
 @Henry VIII  No further escalations.... they just invaded an entirely innocent, passive country. They're not going to stop with Ukraine, within 10 years they're going to try and invade NATO countries, and I'd bet Slovakia is next and then Poland. If we do not stop this now, it's going to end up exactly like WW2. It has already started EXACTLY like WW2, except it Russia  as the aggressor this time
Lol really?  Why? Putin isnt a good person
 @tana gunda  jupp. obama is second worst president in us history. biden is worst by a long shot. biden won peace price while bombing nations to pieces like a coward. biden and obama is the reason for this but mostly biden. so sick and tired of russia and china being blamedfor everythingis china and russia great nations to be in for everyone? hell no. but poverty lvl isnt exactly better in the us.
Because you have been programmed to think that you are safe and “bad” things happen only in films.
 @Cloudy McCloud  You're right, it will be worse if that happens! We hope not!🙄
Naive, it's obvious Putin would invade.
I didn’t either and if this teaches you anything is that there is no honor amongst thieves. Lying sack of sh!t a$$ politician.
 @The Be Sharp  there's an episode of Masyanya about a law banning facts, so everything had to be inversed just like this haha
Putin is a liar and a thief.
 @The Be Sharp  Hitler's strategy
 @CreoleRep7  yeah getting ideas about Taiwan
 @Cloudy McCloud  they got armor going in
 @Patrick Ashmen  it’s not looking good, if NATO is forced to put troops inside Ukraine, that’s enough to spark another World War hence why The West is not even contemplating it at the moment.
What choice did they have seeing NATO building ever more military infrastructure in Ukraine pointing east? Yes NATO was operating their despite western media never mentioned it. Oh wait Reuters did, saying that NATO personal left Ukraine last week. What were they doing there in the first place since Ukraine is not a member of NATO?
Nikolay, they never did - seems to be that you are one of Putins brainwashed bootlickers
What is it Russia is so scared of about Ukraine?? Being among the superpowers doesn't give Putin the Moral Obligation to deter Ukraine from joining military alliances, God protect Ukraine, glory to Ukraine 🇺🇦, 🇰🇪
The reasons why Putin is attacking the Ukraine. Tetyana Montyan from the Ukraine stood up and said the Ukraine had no intention of implementing the Minsk agreement. The Minsk agreement has constantly been breached by the Ukraine they have been selling the Donbass region for years killing around 100,000 citizens which everybody seems to have turned a blind eye too. Putin is continually asking them to stop and they have not so what do they expect. US and NATO is giving false information.
Taiwan now needs nuclear weapons asap
BBC YOU HAD TO DO SAME SO CALLED 
Ww3
Why UN Is Still Silent Till Now
🇺🇦
This was very uncalled for. Putin should be seen like hitler this is evil. This guy need to be put out asap. I never like Russia with there racism.
The Nazi regime of Zelenski must step down now so there will be peace.
My prayers goes to innocent people of Ukraine, much love from Kenya
BD ^ RU :D
Putin is modern day Hitler
The maniac Putin lied. Lying is all they do...
We don't need leaders like this☹☹And if other nations try to intervene and help Ukraine it will be a very large scale war .This is an issue
We will win in the end it's sad the suffering that needs to happened but Russia will feel it in end it's 2022 we will not put up with people like this and countries like this no more
I am with you Ukraine ! Hate cannot be overcome with Hate , but Love : Lord Buddha
Do you people supporting The Ukrainian Government, know that  in it's own words are a self proclaimed Nazi regime. Stop listening and reading our western news media and their lies, and do some research on the subject yourself. The Ukrainian people are being used by America, Nato and the West for it's own goals. So-much so that some UK ministers could not point to Ukraine on a map, if asked.The West does not give a shite about the Ukrainian people. They only want use Ukraine's territory, as place  to put it's WMD missiles, to face Eastward's.
They should have fought Russia at the border.
God help us all
08:02 look at that old fart 🤦🏻‍♂️
You got that right. And that’s why it is so scary
There is only one Nazi regime here and this is the Putin-Regime. To all Russians: bring this man down !!
The USA killed thousands of Innocent  people in Iraq.
 @Md Mahmud  Yes.
 @Md Mahmud  red herring
What will your prayers do? Nothing.
 @Md Mahmud  yeah and the Ukrainians didn’t do that lol
 @Md Mahmud  the British stole trillions from India!! Does that mean Poland deserved invasion in 1939???
 @Augmented Thunder  you sound so heartless 💔💔😩😩
 @alfa braxton  Oh yes, I'm heartless because I don't give into religious nonsense, despite me running a top 100k website for hunting scammers, despite me giving away my money and helping others for nothing. Grow up.
 @Augmented Thunder  What a stupid comment, you're the one who needs to grow up. The guy only wants things to end well. Don't be a dick.
Namo Buddhay 😍☸️ from India
putin i love you
And how cand a comediant become president is just a pupet
Ukraine u messed with the wrong one, long live president Putin.
heavy fighting ?  Stop laying !
Let's all pray 🙏 that Russia  have swift victory,  with minimum loss of life in both sides
Self-defence? Why bomb other buildings like airports and residential areas? This just goes to show how Putitin is a man of words.
Biden and Boris are too much of a coward to send troops to Ukraine
Cry baby pro natos haha
Putting please stop the name of almighty god
do ukraine have a military cos i dont see 1...
US dragged russsia to war.. Now all are silent..nato fooled Innocent citizens of ukraine.. Giving them fake promises..
Where is Ukraines air defense system They need help bad May god be with all the people of Ukraine
Russian public want Eastern Ukraine , but our Putin want all of Ukraine. That is the reality of Russia
what tf are we waiting for
all this is going to cause anger and hatred  on both sides does putin want this?This will be putins down fall
Finally Neonazis are off Donbass. Let Kiev people feel like Donetsk citizens felt for last 8 years. No civil people will be prosecuted. And, no civil people injured by that time. Only killed tonight by Ukranian army civil people of Donetsk.Bendera is WANTED. Seat home. Don't do anything. Russian Army, as comtinental police at this time and region, looking for NeoNazis Bendera Zelensky and his administration. Soon it will be over. Please sort FAKE news
What about middle easterns they weren't people what' about their pain
that man in the subway... you are scared for your boy... then shouldn't you be conscripted, like those able bodied rebel men, to fight for your family! they are so ignorant and does not know NATO cannot fight this war for them militarily! this is what i dread seeing... helpless able bodied ukrainian men not fighting. myanmese youths who do not have the millions in aid and weapons NATO is pouring into ukraine, are fighting the junta.
Something seems mighty strange to me because those pictures that the news is putting up there are abandoned buildings over there and abandoned city what they're bombing abandoned buildings I don't understand there's something more going on here than what we're being told
So NATO left Ukraine to be butt fucked by Russia.
Sooner or later Putins Oligarch friends will handle him…….🤜🤜
 @Martin Hacke  What are they waiting for?
 @Karis Gaitho  Someone is waiting for the right moment - why does Putin keep such a big distance between people and himself……because of COVID?? 😂😂😂😂😂 He knows he won’t survive without violence……matter of time, hopefully before he pushes the button, and someone will take him out - DOWN WITH NAZI HITLER II
No nato to help
Praying from Myanmar. May everyUkrainian be safe. Putin is so problematic. His end will be very soon. 🙏🙏🙏
See what happens when you get in bed with western security services..  Russia is not iraq-Syria-Afghanistan.. it can fight back.. Go ahead Britain send in your troops..  lets see those bollix you claim to have..  or give 10 million Ukrainians free passage into the UK.watch your bigoted public and press push hate upon them.. .  See when your a US and Uk pawn.. they will abandon you like they used all others before you.. filled you will  hundreds millions in arms like the cannon fodder they think you are. .
They need to build bunkers underground asap
I dislike war! It means death, stealing, raping, hunger, fear ...Some guy with muscles tries to test himself on his little brother!
The fact that there are ads on this video shows something rotten about the human civilization
Putin is a lunatic. He’s doing this for his own legacy. So he gets a statue and a parade. A little man overcompensating.
Only lies hi is hitting only military airports
Never thought i would hear air raid sirens in an actual situation in the modern world
Murder.
My stomach hurts an my heart is broken for Ukraine 😞🤍🇷🇼🤍
They better start using all the weapons the west gave them.
Young men will die for that old man. And mothers will cry for those young men and putin will not care. Fcuk off you lying POS!
Russia is very close to making alot of people very angry. Good luck to all my brothers and sisters in Ukraine. Putin needs to stand down if he wants his country stand the bombardment coming it's way
Wow the coverage is amazing....Anyone remember when BBC went to iraq during the USA/UK backed invasion?Men women bombed.....Babies burned....Yep me neither.Western hyprocrisy
Putin's sick as fuuk attacking a peaceful democratic Country. The West should have done more against terrorist Russia
The bear drew a line in the sand, the west crossed it and didn't listen to their fears. Ukraine the pawn in this game, high fives among the military industrial complex they got their wish, back in profit.
In my opinion it's better for Ukraine to surrender itself
why ..💔💔
I mean no offense, but this is part of the problem. It's so easy to get complacent with the last 50 years of peace in the first world that we can't even imagine things like this. We take for granted the peace we've lived under, but it's incredibly fragile. War can still happen in an instant. There are now generations of people who haven't seen real war, and are unprepared for it in both training and temperament. This isn't directed at you, but at all of us for thinking it could never happen. All of that said, yes, it is chilling to witness.
 @Nautilus Guitars  i 100% agree, we have become complacent, especially with technology (imo), and we should still be vigilant about war and stuff, but you would stiller never expect to see it in the modern world, but i guess alot of humans (like putin) dont care about diplomacy
 @CentreMetre  Technology has certainly been a big part of our detachment of reality. I do get what you're saying. It's hard to imagine and hard to truly comprehend. At the same time, as a student of history, I knew this day would come eventually. It's inevitable, as much as I wish that wasn't true. We just aren't past it as a species yet. It's unfortunate, and the results are horrific. But we should always remain conscious of it, and be prepared to unite against it.
Love to Russia ❤️❤️❤️
Do we have a chickenshit UN. We should be bombing Russia airports Russia highways Russia infrastructure.
Russia or Ukraine. Pest or Kolera.Russia aggressive as fuck, Ukraine giving advanced military weapons- and explosives training to hardcore nazis. We all know what they need this kind of training for. Breivik, anyone remember?Im good with Russia controlling Ukraine, its not like they will attack more then old soviet states anyway. We dont have to worry, my worry like i said is the nazis which are more of a threat to our EU countries then Russia is. Way more dangerous.
Nato left Ukraine high and dry.
Putin is the Hitler of modern world!
My heart goes for the Brave Russian PPL .. 😭.  .... 🇷🇺God help Russia .
So our wonderful leadership seems not to have armed the Ukraine to the teeth, you have to wonder if even this will wake them up to the two over armed and one of them at least intelligent and over wealthy busy colonising (no tanks needed) monsters in the world today.
Ukraine gonna need a whole lot more than just prayers
Stay strong Ukraine! No to war!
Lol
I’m from Ukraine and we don't need words of encouragement. We’re heartbroken and the rest of the world just watching. NATO - not action talk only. 😭
Praying for peace in Russia-Ukraine.
So because of a fictional threat from UKRAINE, Putin in his deranged mind thought that destruction of a country was a good idea, how psychotic do you have to be to think that maybe something may happen, maybe it won't but let's invade, kill many people, piss off the west, they started the war with UKRAINE, because of something that was inside Putins head, he's mentally disturbed. Russia is the problem not the UKRAINE, defending itself from an imaginary enemy. Its all made up so Putin can take back UKRAINE because he wants USSR back as one
Putin 🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕
I'll never understand this world
What russia does is just self defence as what israel daes to syria
🙏🏻❤️ Praying for the Ukraine 🇺🇦 from NYC 🙏🏻❤️
My heart is very happy. East will beat shot out of west. West is terrorist
This is horrible, My heart goes out to the civilians.
Does he stop at Ukraine?
But is it really a surprise? Georgia got invaded as well but no one cared
Why are you surprised? It was obviously.
Ukraine - current prey of USAUSA triggered ukraine to join in NATOIf ukraine join NATO, USA can deploy their troops on russian border and threat russiaSo Russia reacted to safeguard themselvesUSA is the basic reason for all the war in earth currently, that cunning fox needs to be punishedWhatever the reason, killing civilians can't be justifiedRussia please don't follow like America, killing innocent people in middle east countries, you doing it to ukraine ?
 @Mr.Kongunadu  It's human nature for war, if not one country there's always others lmao. How about crying about one country you learn that we ourselves are disgusting parasites to this planet.
 @Mr.Kongunadu  STFUP. You wish you had the freedoms U.S had.
Not that I support Russia but what can the rest of the world do? If US/nato gets involved it can escalate quickly into world war and then definitely civilians will also be attacked. Even if countries not in nato try to attach Russia, it might still stay the same. But it is tough to see what ukraine has to endure too. So what is the right move? No one knows
 @Trashboªt   Everything is just star dust ?
This is what happens when you side with America lmao. Good luck
 @Mr.Kongunadu  everything is just atoms*
Ur president must be funished for this..why he trust nato and usa like a blind one
 @D star Boi  so fuckin true, fck US and their bullshit,  they Just want war so they can sell their weapons!
 @wendy widjaja  Humans are always gonna have war lmao. It's about time we all come to the fact we aren't good for the earth
 @Trashboªt  so you want war, because I don't like the idea of anyone dying for objects, that seems pointless.
Blame your government, not NATO. Ukraine isn't a NATO country. Why didn't Ukraine join NATO back in 2014? And since then why hasn't Ukraine been developing an extensive network of anti-tank ditches, ideally booby-trapped? Why hasn't Ukraine been rigging bridges with explosives in case of an invasion? And rigging trees with explosives too to create abatis defences? Why hasn't Ukraine been buying loads of aircraft, UCAVs, SAM systems, SHORAD systems, MLRS launchers and mobile anti-ship missile launchers?That said, countries have given you Javelin and NLAW anti-tank weapons as well as Stinger MANPADS to shoot down drones and helicopters, including attack helicopters, which is practical support, not words of encouragement. Plus Germany has given Ukraine 1.8 billion euros since 2014. What did Ukraine spend that money on? Or did it go into the pockets of oligarchs?
 @Suresh Kumar  The right move is to stop Putin. Once he's taken Ukraine I can't see him stopping there.
 @Drew Peacock  that's the question, how do you stop Putin?
 @Suresh Kumar  By giving Ukraine the gear it needs to fight Russia. Ukraine urgently needs SAM systems, SHORAD systems, UCAVs, MLRS launchers and mobile anti-ship missile launchers. As well as loads more anti-tank weapons.
 @mr mash  No one wants war it's indeed pointless and it hurts us and the planet. But am I and you gonna stop it? No we are just specks
As long as Russia has China's support, they are untouchable.
 @Drew Peacock  bruh, no matter how much hardware you give , they don't have the numbers. Check out the infantry strength.
 @Trashboªt  you said humans are always gonna want war so my point was do you want war or are you an alien
 @mr mash  Once again you don't see my point, war doesn't stop? And aliens don't exsist? Are you okay...?
Yes, I share this as well. Here is my assessment of what could have prevented a war between Russia and Ukraine that the media is not telling you. Let’s have a debate by commenting on this video, watch this clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dURbVp6gM0
What about Iraq?
My heart goes out to all Ukrainians, military and civilian
Your heart didn't respond during Us genocide in Middle east. Putin has done nothing to Ukraine similar to Us
Terrible ....The USA and UK would never do things like this .Except in  Afghanistan 2001 , Iraq 2003 , Libya 2011  .
 @norman clegg   hahaha
 @norman clegg   and Yougoslavia
 @Out of the box  He was killing his own people and others.. Ukraine has not
 @Polymathic Talk  +15p

Bbc is lying to you, yes russia is in Ukraine but not for Ukraine invasion, they there for the 2 states that wants theor independence and 2014 violence to stop
 @norman clegg   someone with common sense
And people in the army who are just puppets
 @Out of the box  What about it? Was Ukraine ever on Iraq?
 @Out of the box  Them too.
 @Polymathic Talk  trying to get followers through a war, you're a sad and tiny person
Fact, Reminder that ukraine is a corrupt puppet regime that is in the pocket of the demons that run USA.

Britain will be next after Ukraine.
Innocent people lose there lives
lol
Yeah, Israel bombed Palestine yesterday, USA bombed Somalia yesterday, those don't matter right, cnn fkn war news propagamda
 @Neo Nationalist  You just don't want people to talk about the new Hitler in Europe called Putin. That's why you are trying to change the topic. Well the topic here and now is Putin. Putin has become the epitome of Russia's imperialist aspirations and really stands as the new Hitler of Europe. Ukraine suffers because of that. The new greedy Hitler called Putin wants to conquer its neighboring territories and subjugate other nations. Putin = Hitler
 @Abstern   there are no states in Ukraine ashore, just like Essex county of NJ is not a “state”
Yes your right
 @Out of the box  yeah, Israel bombed Palestine yesterday and whole summer, and USA bombed Somalia yesterday. Yet onlu this is important, supporting the Ukrainian nazi regime is more important for the white Europeans
 @Out of the box  Who are they attacking?
 @norman clegg   you can't plan to kill someone then get mad when the strike back
 @Abstern   😂😅 So why are they bombing the entire country?
Your heart cannot do anything for nobody.
Same i pray for all the kids mothers old people 🙏🙏🙏
 @Abstern   Russians in ukraine could just move to russia. Gotta leave ukraines land behind though of course.

 @Xendrius  Stop trying to blame Russia's aggression on the USA -- take responsibility for your own mistakes.
The Klima Problem made the People better and this is what Putin Not Need.Putin Need the Clevage and hies Frind ,this is good for the Rich People ,then he need the Sozialisem not, this is not what Russia Need oder will or the Oligarchs .Putin will not Lose hie Place or his Power ,he like his mony and his Position and the Mony .He Lifs for the Mony and his Place and not for Anybody or the Humans or Human Rights.He say self over his Solider an the Normal People ,this People is how my Dog .I give him a Paymant or Treats an my Stupide mass made what I will.The best is the Mass made this,the Mass need it to made his Self to a Dog.This Need all People or the Most of this World.The Human is not only a Human ,the Human is a Rat ,a Pig and a Dog ,and a Parasite in one Lifeform.
 @Neo Nationalist  Where were you when the Middle East people were killing each other for decades? I didn't hear you say anything then.  America gets involved and you act like the Middle East was living in peace. GTFO here with that trash 🤣🤣

 @Hung Duong  Actually, the  North Vietnamese invaded South Vietnam, with help from the Soviets and China. The USA did not invade North Vietnam.
Please pray for mercy for our leaders 🙏 this is so devastating we all are going to suffer the consequences from this terribly event. Pray with out stop please.
 @George Cher  So according to you , Yemen is being bombed by the Saudis to help Yemen against Iran.
 @Duke of Prunes II  Do you think its logical that Britain sells arms to Saudi Arabia then gives Humanitarian aid to Yemen.
 @Marvhead  Are they? Have you seen it with your own eyes? Then a question for you why did the Ukranians bombed Russian teritorry, 100 km from the border, two three days ago?
 @Out of the box  What you mean the war that republicans started against Iraq? that one?
war is in our blood only strong will survive, left whining and crying for women
 @norman clegg   only 1 US president NEVER start any war in his term, that because OF is just right after WWII
 @Polymathic Talk  It's too late for any could-haves. Putin has revealed to the world what a tyrant and liar he is. I am also not interested in your version or opinion of the media. The whole world knows what is going on.
GO RUSSIAAAA 🇷🇸🇷🇸🇷🇸🇷🇸🇷🇸
Biden and Trudeau are trying to act tough to Putin but they couldn't even handle a couple guys honking their horns.🤣

That's it horrible  ?? U should condemned Russian otherwise a simple sympathy is nothing
 @Out of the box  I knew someone is going say this....
 @GRIME & GARAGE  US got no support in the UN security council from UAE. Saudis aren't going to lower prices for US. EU, after sanctions, now wants gas and oil from Iran. Looks like Joe and Hunter Biden made a big mess....🤡🤡

 @Out of the box  the Invasion In Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq etc. Why aren’t the usa, uk and those who supported the invasion punished? Fxxx America
 @GRIME & GARAGE  Our allies are attacking the terrorist Houthi militia, not Yemen, because this militia is racist, terrorist  and killing civilians and chanting Death to America, Death to Britsh.
 @Abstern  .....  What Led to this Moment?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJbSJqZoTIg
 @Andras Kleistenes  how do you dare to talk about human rights when you talk about white supremacy. Gross
 @Xendrius  👍🏻
 @GRIME & GARAGE  Go ahead and change the subject...
 @GRIME & GARAGE  exactly! And all the killings in the Middle East! Sanction on UK!
 @Дмитрий Сергеев  New: Putin announces “special military operation…  aimed at demilitarisation and denazification of Ukraine.” 👍🏻
 @name1.1 name 2.1  no because sadly to the west white lives matter only!
 @vulc1  👈🏻🤡 Low IQ has entered chat
 @OfficialBandido  Fake News, deep fake
Remember shock and awe?
 @Duke of Prunes II  Gulf of Tolkien says otherwise.
 @GRIME & GARAGE  👍🏻
 @Tell me more  America probably needs to do a Soleimani on Putin in Moscow in broad daylight. But if the Russians can retaliate then that probably wouldn't happen.
 @Andras Kleistenes   So the Middle East were not sovereign? They too had democratic governments until the Americans and Britain killed them.
 @Melissa Windle  well, what about 50, 000 Ukrainian fled to Russia yesterday? My dear! Who would just left their?
 @Brian Hurley  Putin and Assad fought off ISIS that the west backed, bit like the CIA Obama led coup in Ukraine in 2014..🤡
 @Melissa Windle  That's the lie you was told but,  was it OK for America and Britain to kill Iraqis?
 @norman clegg   except syria,lebanon...u forgot vietnam,combodia.....how america left afghanistan??? Like a thief at mid night.....
 @Lesco Brandon  Ukraine will never be erased.
 @Wahyu Indrasto  No, need to do on The Bi-Din Regime.
 @Tell me more  👍🏻
This is horrible indeed
 @Out of the box  no one cares about Iraq right now Russia and Ukraine is more serious
Your heart didn,t go for the 20 thousands civilians ukraine killed in donbass
 @Wahyu Indrasto  Russia needs to do a Soleimani on Biden but, Russia probably won't as sleepy Joe is half dead.
 @norman clegg   Belgrad 1999
I hope I was wrong, but sadly I am not. People are suffering now. And NATO and US are not there to save them. They were quick to take nukes from them, however.There is still time for Ukrainians to surrender, they are not from a warrior race like Afghans, who can fight for 20-40 years non-stop. In this case its the same culture and religion too, so even less incentive and motivation to resist. The sooner they surrender, the better is the chance to strike a deal with Moscow which will give them some level of autonomy...
Ukrainian military targeting civilians, while Russia liberating Ukraine from the fascists.
 @norman clegg   we are talking about Europe here not some 3rd world colonies
This truly horrible it's going to be like The Nazi Occupations of WW2 all over again
 @G.V.  Which world have you been living in?  In which country has the Middle Eastern people were killing eachother?
 @Brian Hurley  Maybe you are too thick to remember that the West and Israel are bombing Syria illegally and killing civilians. Maybe you are too thick to know Russia was invited to Syria.
https://youtu.be/tIxKmqNxThU
So only civilians are important and all others can die?
Когда вы пришельцы бомбили Югославию, ваше сердечко даже не дернулось, мы не варвары как вы, мы бьем только по аэропортом с которых они бомбят наших русских людей, желаю вам всего наихудшего!
yes and the nerve of Putin to say that it is out of self defense and he needs to liberate Ukranians from it's government when Russia is run by the former head of the KGB!!
 @Out of the box  True in Afghanistan and Iraq a lot of innocent people died.
 @Out of the box  Them too
Were people this sympathetic when the talibans invaded Afghanistan?
Guys,YaH The Heavenly FATHER HIMSELF was Who they Crucified for our sins and “HERE IS THE PROOF”From the Ancient Semitic Scroll: 
It feels so scary I know it's so saddddddddddddddd
 @norman clegg   So that makes the invasion of Ukraine ok??
they are bombing military targets. no civilians. just like how israel always bombing military targets and not little children. what russia and israel did is the same thing.
THAT IS HORRIBLE YOU SAY? and occupation of Avganistan Pakistan and Yugoslavia isnt horrible? P0rn avialable on every corner to young kids isnt terrible? You are heavly brainwashed deluded person. Scariest part is that people like you have  a right to take a birth
Are you not sorry for killing of  millions of Innocent people worldwide includin Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan and Lybia by your so called democratic leaders like Bush, Blair or Sarcozy and many others ? Now you are crying for people of Ukraine ?
Peace will never come as long as Ukraine join NATO FORCE .How would USA feel if Russia starts to join forces with USA Neighbours ???I don't understand why USA/NATO had to build defensive forces on Russia Neighbouring Countries .Face the consequence now 🤦
Whyyy does Russia bad
The truth is Ukraine didn't offer any peace and security  guarantees to Russia. Like..Zelensky, considering that the Ukraine has no real chance to enter Nato, he could have publicly given up joining Nato for now...
Russia isnt targetting civilians. They have explicit orders to only take out military installations and return fire when fired upon. It is not a war against the peoples or a war for territory. It is a politional action to overthrow the corrupt gov in Kiev (or wherever they are now, bc they already fled, as criminals always do)
 @norman clegg   So by comparing what has happened in the past is your justification for what Putin has done now.  This behavior can never be justified. Innocent people pay the price for this, whilst Putin sits in his ivory tower slapping himself on the back.
 @Andras Kleistenes  💯
 @Abstern   don’t procreate.
 @Abstern   lmfao I bet you believed Putin when he said they were there for a peace keeping mission
 @Duke of Prunes II  Why shouldnt I change the subject.The western hypocrisy is sickening.
 @dinkin flicka  You would never say that to a service man and still have your teeth.
Take the refugees in your country then we have too many foreigners in Britain

So, Europeans are higher class than Arabs?
Putin only taking back whats belongs to Russia 🇷🇺

This is humanity problem, they aint fixed yet because of what happened in the past, many government is still serving for their advantage and ambition🤷‍♂️
This feels like the day Iraq invasion
There are fire balls everyday in Palestine when illegal ISrahell bombs,  kills and commit genocide. Yet cute EU and US never talk about humanity, sanctions, invasion. How hypocrite you are!!!Now, you should also say, 
 @Paul Schulte  Я не прячусь.  А ты пустышка.Мир тесен. Иногда, даже в течении одной жизни, случаются такие встречи... Будет для тебя хорошо, если ты даже не успеешь заметить.
 @name1.1 name 2.1  Wrong! Ukraine is just another name for Kievan Rus' and it is MUCH older than Russia. In fact, Russia around Moscow first appeared as Kiev's colony. Like America was Great Britain's colony. Russia attacking Ukraine today is same as America would attack Great Britain and lie that America made Britain. Today Russia is lying and attacking its  motherland.
 @CarFreeNeoliberalGeorgistYIMBY  tell me when ur heart goes out or what u think ur helping with 😂
 @Lun Thang  What kind of coupe are you taliking about? Zelenskij is an elected president  , Ukrainen is  a plural democratic country , unlike Russia which is dictatorship

The new greedy Hitler called Putin wants to conquer its neighboring territories and subjugate other nations. Putin = Hitler
 @Kepler Mission  that would start a nuclear war immediately
 @Tell me more  So this means , If USA intervened in The Middle East , Russia has the same right to kill innocents in Ukraine ? Are you mad??? Russia is the torturer and killer of Europe ! Putyin is similar to Hitler
 @Kepler Mission  be carefull what you wish for
 @Duke of Prunes II  Im not crying but im sure the people of Ukraine are
 @Sergei Gorbachov  
what's interesting is how slow flightradar24 is going....fake war for TV distractions from 5th session of the Grand Jury Proceedings.
what about Gaza
US could crush Russia if it wanted to do so.
Corrupt Europe donated in the dark, so much is our money, 17 billion euros to Ukraine, the people have not seen one. Do you really believe that Ukrainians are willing to be slaughtered for a bunch of pro-Nazi oligarchs with overflowing accounts abroad or for a puppet who came to power and immediately corrupted? Ukrainians will not fight for these corrupt, Putin knows.
 @norman clegg   and more countries in America as well
 @Out of the box  SHUT THE FUCK UP ABOUT IRAQ. Nobody wants to hear your whataboutisms you absolute morons
Putin is Hero


NATO and the United States failed Ukraine.  If  Russia/Putin are anti-natzi does that mean east Germany is next?   Stay strong Ukraine!

Putin's a world economic forum member. :D

 @vulc1  You poor soul, so meesed up! Here is two other for you: What about Kossovo - exactly the same situation - people slaughtering civilians, then the army came in its own teritorry, even historically speaking, then Americans came and what happened? And the second one - do you know who J. Carter was - a hint american president, who said that for all its existence the USA were not in a war for ... 11 years only. About Hitler you have to be a real illiterate, not knowing that Hitler was antisemite and was killing Jews, did the camps and all that stuff. How does the Putin figure fill in that? Kind a don't see it. No camps. On the other hand you have Ukrainians killing civilian people. Otherwise you are right
They wanted a good life like the rest of us take for granted. Decent people. This is a punishment for them trying to embrace European lifestyle. Also resources. Russian greed. Russia sort your own issues out if you are that awesome.
what happened to the reporters covid mask hahahahahaha
U.S & their NATO boyfriends scared of Russia 😱👎🏼 why you sending troops if you ain’t going to do anything to Russia. Also in Syria U.S was bluffing against Putin so stop all your BS military flexing 🤦🏻‍♂️However, Afghanistan defeated Russia, Taliban defeated U.S and NATO 🥴🥴🥴
 @GRIME & GARAGE  Obviously you are here to say something profound. There, you have said it. I acknowledge your virtue signaling. 👋 Bye.
hahahaha look at the jets :D
Screw ya heart dummy
Let’s goooooo 🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
 @Melissa Windle  Ukraine was killing their own people for 8 years now.
they all Nazis including Putin, Biden and Boris
Wait a while, its you or should I say us next ! Make no mistake, this is only the very beginning.
My heart is with them too. But I am not giving any military support though lmao. That is their problem.
 @Polymathic Talk  oh I can tell you that's not going to happen now with all these liberals you've got as much of a chance of a debate as Ukraine winning.
Ciao Flavio

All politicians of the superpowers like to rush to the 
 @Дмитрий Сергеев  That’s just one of several lies. Do you live anywhere in the Ukraine, otherwise you are a victim of the russian state’s propaganda machine. So you actually believe that the russian separatists have done nothing wrong in the south-eastern regions? Of course they have. If they hadn’t, there wouldn’t have been a lot of ukranian civilians who had died in the last decade. The biggest lie of all is that Russia had no interest in invading Ukraine, and yet they did!
If we don't stop importing gas from Russia and bring back coal, there is no way we can beat Russia.

 @юрий акул  now you know they don't like the truth on this channel.
nobody want to war but the greedy leader always feel the world is not enough for himself.
Its time for war, let the blood flow on the streets, let the pompous and fatuous people mark their end, it is time for retribution, it is time for chaos to swallow the world.
 @Out of the box  No difference Any war is terrible
 @Out of the box  nobody cares about Iraq lel
 @Neo Nationalist  both sides lost loved ones
 @Raymond Connor  Are you serious! You can’t give up something that you had in your posession, and then take it back years later. Ukraine belongs to Ukraine, Russia belongs to Russia. Do you understand?
 @Preben Poe Jensen  Your mind is totally corrupt I would say. Why - for starters Ukraine is killing its civilians, shown not only by the Russian and pro Russian media. So you are either blind or just plain stupid to say that is not a fact. Then, Invasion is what the US did in Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Korea, Vietnam, the list can go on and on. But let me put it this way for you, cause you are either very young or blind - Have you heard about Kossovo? Do you Know what happened there? One more for you - South Osetia - US pumped up the Georgians to attack civilians and Russia, then they left them. Same what happens here in Ukraine. So which is worse - to play with someone like the US did, or to go protect your own and not shoot even one person?
We need to all fight against Russia or else our children will live in a word controlled by Soviets
 @Archiitx  Lets erase the democrat party of the US then and leave Russia and China on their own. And care about our own yards, then the world will be a much better place. Oh and Pfizer as well. Now I will be banned from youtube ))))))
 @Дмитрий Сергеев  What a fool, you are! I’ve never called you a Russian separatist. That’s only in your head!
 @SIMPSON Bart  You have any proof of that or are you just parroting propaganda?
 @Lesco Brandon  You accidentally said Biden. You mean Donald Trump. There, I fixed it for you.

What ab USA civilians?
 @Sergei Gorbachov  Yeah, my mind is corrupt! That’s just idiotic to say that. We all know that thousands of Russian and Ukranian civilians have lost their lives during the last decade. To call someone blind or stupid is no way of debating. If you don’t show respect to other people, then I can call you anything I want. Don’t f...... comment what I write, if you only want to patronize me, instead of debating the situation. We are talking about a serious situation, and you just insult me! You little s...

Horrible? What about those countries been bullied by US ? What do you call on that?
 @юрий акул  Oh I thought I was commenting on MSNBC my bad.
 @Raymond Connor  Why do you think, I’m American, or that I supported that USA invaded Iraq? I’ve always been against that USA and some other countries invaded Iraq. You must have me confused with someone else!
 @Tell me more  The world of reality.  If you don't know about the inner strife and turmoil that had been going on in the Middle East for decades prior to America's arrival then you're a lost cause and shouldn't even be in this conversation.  You're obviously uninformed 🤦‍♂
 @Out of the box  are you referring to the Iraq war, or is there something else going on in Iraq
 @norman clegg   Putyin and his state much Nazi then anyone else in the World. Russia has killled ten's of thousends , already
 @norman clegg   to put down governments that were not democratically elected. Ukraine is a democracy and in the west it is acceptable to declare war on dictatorships, but not on democracies
Your 
 @Andras Kleistenes  fool all are human being same blood and flesh 😡
And I am whiching this in France and Suisse and I think the he'd of russa is mad I really hate him and I am 9 and still anderstand this
Man! Bro! Olha eles tem a culpa toda! ucranianos
 @Preben Poe Jensen  So you stupid then. Cause discussion means understanding the other one's point. Which you don't. Discussions means taking into consideration different points of view, which you don't. Or you simply need a few lessons in English, so that you understand what the people are saying to you. You insist on you being the right one, but you do not know history. And that is only showing that you are a weal opponent. Or simply stupid. So you need not only to be patronized, but slapped untill you realise that there was history and a lot of other perpectives. Which you do not acknowledge. Like I said you are either stupid or simply do not want to see what's behind the propaganda of the western world. While some of us lived long enough to know the truth behind propaganda and what happens in war - there are no winners. Only the people who sell guns. Who that might be in this case? Anyhow you should either learn to accept others' points of view or continue to be stupid.
 @mark urch  Does that matter, in war everyone loses something, but its a good start, to bring down this society, this life where everyone thinks that peace is everywhere and can solve everything. I very much believe that this democratic society is a disease, the people should know, that democracy has now been crippled by its ignorance, and its incompetence of their people, you let business men run your courts, now your country is nothing more then hierarchy its self.  (I do not support monarchy, or communism but i do love the idea of lessening foolish uprising.)And that is because all of you are sheeps to these influential men,  they line you up for wealth, and now look, the civil unrest that is in USA.  The time has come for the world to be shaken to its core.
Lmao
lmfao
 @G.V.  I know enough of the truth to teach you. You have no clue of the truth.
/:
 @Sergei Gorbachov  And one more thing, you little brat! I critisize USA just as much, as I critisize Russia, if they do something wrong but it’s a very old tactic to change the subject instead of talking about the real issue. By the way, you mentioned Syria, that’s funny cos Assad has been a dictator for years, and Putin supported him due to their collaboration in year long trades with military weapons. So you assume that I’m American or support what USA do on the big foreign scene, and then you have the nerve to call other people stupid! Bravo!,
 @Brian Hurley  how would you like it if someone give you oders to leave your home and country in the middle of winter with nowere to go or money to live have a little think about that
 @Andras Kleistenes  Are you out of your mind? Learn history. What happened in Ukraine in 2014? And why is it normal to kill people in Middle East? Why?
Where where you when Donbass was bombed every day
 @Tell me more  Apparently you know very little. Teaching is definitely out of your scope of possibilities. You would do better to stick to simpler tasks.
Civilians are not under fire, only military bases.
Your heart goes out for all the civilians NATO and the US blows up daily? Ah sorry they are brown people, never mind.
Military infrastructure targeted only. Western media spreading hysteria again.
I feel you  so sad😪
 @Andras Kleistenes  1. Get educated 2. Read all the diplomatic governments that the UK and US have toppled and put a dictator in.
Your heart is racist against children and civilians who were terrorised in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and Lybia by NATO.
 @LaSt PrAyeR-316  I wonder how terrorists are born... could it be tye west going into their country robbilg their natural resources and killing them? The they attack back and are terrorist, lol. Read a bit of history about the Europeans in Asia and America etc.
 @Out of the box  yes you can only care about one of those two countries. Fuckin idiot
oh yay that'll help.  idiot.
Ukraine could have handled it peacefully but was pushed to war by NATO.
Destroy the Russian economy and send it back to the dark ages!!! Putin's end is near.
Then why are you here on YouTube saying it?To jump on the band wagon?To look like a nice person on YouTube?Pretending to be concerned?You people in the comment section make me sick.
Take your heart back to it belongs.Dont waste it.
Putin is rekindling a 🔥 and the west is throwing the oil....Poor civilians that are caught up in all this mess 😒😟🥺
 @Out of the box   Iraq  choose war not peace
https://youtu.be/VDu3w1DqGhw
 @norman clegg   still don’t know what bringing up these wars mean - 😂 we didn’t kill them the military did ? We can feel bad bc we don’t condone it . Just bc we live somewhere doesn’t mean we think our countries are right !
 @Greg C  😄
Не волнуйтесь - атаки направлены только  против военных объектов ☝️Это ни в какое сравнение не идёт с бомбардировкой ЮГОСЛАВИИ!!!, ГДЕ НАТО  бомбило без разбора абсолюино всё: школы, больницы, вокзалы, водное обеспечение и электростанции ☝️😤😤😤
Вы забываете из-за чего Путин принял такое решение - из-за того, что украинские военные 8 лет убивали мирных жителей Донбасса
 @Polymathic Talk  Only who could prevent the war between Russia and Ukraine is Putin them self. Russia did attack Ukraine and nobody did attack Russia
 @norman clegg   Kosovo also. Nice man!
 @norman clegg   Well, who did first attack Afghanistan? In Libya one bloodtihisty dictator sent the army on civilians calling them 
Why your hearts are cold to other countries & nations that been attack. By EU NATO US and there allies where are the comments or rebuilding money.words are mean less without action.
when israel, turkey and the united states bomb the syrian army that fights against terrorists nobody said anything but now that russia bombs military bases in ukraine everyone gets angry and annoyed, damn weak brains
Why your hearts are cold to other countries & nations that been attack. By EU NATO US and there allies where are the comments or rebuilding money.words are mean less without action.
 @norman clegg   Guess you aren't going to include the terrorist acts and threat of terror from those countries, yea they were and are all blameless angels.
Aww, chicken.
 @Kepler Mission  🤦‍♂️🇬🇧
 @Neo Nationalist 
 @Abstern   Kiev isn't one of that regions. This is a full blown invasion.
Kad ste bombardovali srpske civile1999 nije vam bilo zao?pacovi jedni americki!!!!
 @name1.1 name 2.1  You don't understand that most of us dislike killing, you dimwit.
 @name1.1 name 2.1  Sorry it upsets you that Al-Shaabab was bombed in Somalia, think the Somalian government was on board with that.
I pray for you brothers in Ukraine. May almighty God raise for dears. No need of war in this century

There’s no such thing as a winnable war
 @CarFreeNeoliberalGeorgistYIMBY  my heart will go on and on… love can touch just one time and last for a lifetime.
What about Syria? Palestine? Iraq? Where were all your hearts then. This will go the same way, nothing will be done by anyone. The bullies do anything they want and label us then make us hate each other.
Those are infrastructure and military targets.Unlike the Ukraine regime and Kplomoisky batallion  murders .
SURRENDER - and live for another day. That corrupt puddle of diarrhea Ukraine needs to be erased from the Earth.
USA government told the world they realized a 
 @Abstern   Ты что несёшь ?Соседнее государство РФ вторглось на территорию другого суверенного государства Украина и убивает мирных граждан для для того чтобы остановить насилие ?
 @norman clegg   and Serbia 1999.😥
 @Andras Kleistenes  I agree with you wholeheartedly.... But some people you can't educate...
it's fun to watch fakes.)))

 @Ramesh Kumar  also china want india. Plz pray for india. China is dangerous
The BBC are 'less than human scumbags'. They show you what their autocue writers want you to see. Its all a nicely concocted show.Helped push misinformation so our wealth could be stolen from our future selves. Now they have taken the wealth from our future selves and our children, they are coming for our sovereignty and human rights.Nicely set up so China can feign worry about their borders. Then the new order can come in with a plan to govern all nations from above. No longer will the cabal who orchestrate all of this, have to answer to individual nations.We will call it openly the 'Global United Nations 2.0' or something like that. It is, like the devil, known by many names. New World Order springs to mind.You will all have crapped your knickers so much, that you will forget the base level of freedoms and autonomy we are supposed to hold over our own lives and the lives of the ones we love.You will beg for these animals to take away all control you have, so they can save you from the mess they created. And they will give you an almost imperceptible amount of your inherent rights and democratic freedom back, and you will likely see it as a win.The BBC dont cover the horrific assault on democracy in Canada, by the Canadian government. They dont tell you that the richest families in the world, and their monolithic corporate and political infrastructure, created so much money that your currency is worth so much less.They took all that money in relief payments while you have no relief.  So, they have doubled and tripled their wealth, while the rest of us eat the charge. But the BBC blame it on things like a war with Russia. They tell you that Nazi's are violently protesting in Canada while peaceful protestors are assaulted. They tell you Jimmy Savile is just good hearted and wants to help kids.... If your leader said 
 @norman clegg   go furslf , we r talking about what Russia is doing not what US, besides Us never invaded its neighbors you Putin’s  bot
Putin said he will not bomb innocent civilians, he will only bomb the army
 @Xendrius  u r a liar 🤥 and Putin’s bot besides no one is more corrupt than current Russian president and government
 @Sean Alvarez  Откуда вы черпаете информацию? Россия не нападает на Украину. В очередной раз объединилась государственная пропаганда, чтобы начать войну.
 @DAFENSHE✍  and he lied 🤥 about everything he said before why should anyone believe him now?
As if to make my point - the entity that controls the governance of all countries in this conflict, on both sides, do not care about Ukrainian citizens. They, like the rest of us are simply collateral damage Acceptable collateral damage. The security our society has built up is being destroyed in front of our eyes. With no resources and no freedoms, what exactly do you have?How far from that reality do you truthfully think we are? If those in real power are not saints, then your way back from this to normal times is unlikely at best.How do those who oppress you phrase it? A new normal. Will that be a good 'new normal' you think?
 @Sean Alvarez  Мне грустно из-за жертв, и никто этого не заслуживает. СМИ должны прекратить делиться дезинформацией. Путин давно предупреждал мир.
What don't you understand?rUkraine got bad politicians! They want to annex Ukraine to Europe and NATO to the army !!rNobody asks anything ... it's important that politicians fill their pockets with money !!rThe people have brainwashed the roses to smell more beautiful in Europe ..rUkranie politicians provoked war! Because the rule is known that Ukraine cannot be a NATO country !! By the way, World War 3 starts ... And what ?? should that happen ???rUkraine should now capitulate ... and civilians should be saved ... and politicians should be hanged because they provoked the war !!
Nobody is targeting civilians stop spreading fake news u moron
The land belonegs to rushia from world 2 of the usrr so theybshould have it but it is  bad because they broke a promise
 @Abstern   I heard from some people who have family there, that some states really want to return to Russia. It's that true?
We all need to show support to ukraine❤
This is probly a start of world war 3
 @Abstern   России уже начала военные действия на территории Украины , есть жертвы среди военных с обеих сторон а также среди мирного населения Украины .
Firstly, let's all be honest. None of you knew anything about the Ukraine or its political landscape until five seconds ago.Secondly, the political scene in the Ukraine has been dominated by Far Right/White Supremacist groups like Svoboda and corrupt foreign business elements (Like the Biden's) syphoning off millions of dollars, for years. The Ukraine has been a failed state for some time, like a rotten apple, it looked good on the outside, but was black and toxic in the middle.Lastly, Putin is fighting Fascism and Neo Nazism - so if you stand against Russia but for the Ukraine, then you are supporting White Supremacy and Neo Nazism in the Ukraine. I thought we were against White Supremacy?
 @Abstern   А Путин кто такой чтобы предупреждать весь мир ?Информацию получаю из разных источников в том числе с мест событий от самих украинцев
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
 @Out of the box  or Afghanistan
 @Out of the box   what going on with Iraq?
 @Angela Bronckhurst  woof woof russian troll
Całe szczęście,że prezydentem nie jest ten ruski agent trump.którego rucham w sam środek dupy. Tego ruskiego ,debilnego agenta. Ch. Ci w w dupę kolego
 @Angela Bronckhurst  putin is a knight of justice.  and they all lived happily ever after.
Oh no, fear, sadness blah blah blah, this is why so many humans are so stupid and weak. Rise the hell up and get these clowns out of power! Nope instead stay home and watch your stupid sports, movies and eat fast food.
yes
 @Logos Maxima  yes they were
 @Preston 🏳️‍🌈⃠Garvey  stop asking me to help settlements, every day it is the same shit. Stop it. It is enough
Its horrible before the games start...once its started, its business....Americans definitely understand this game
 @Neo Nationalist  stay ignorant Putin likes you that way. You don't know what people did or did or do. By the way dictators should be hunted.
 @Kirk Terrace  it does, it shows compassion. Something a lot of people don't show these days.
 @norman clegg   not even close to the same thing.
It's  a war
Why just the civilians. I feel bad for everyone there
This is how Palestinians feel every day and have been for decades, America is funding and supporting Isreal while they do the same thing to Palestinians.
 @Abstern   damn that didn’t age well over just 5 hours 🤦‍♂️
 @norman clegg   doesn't make this less terrible. Use your brain mate
 @Angela Bronckhurst  ooookay. So first, I heard about it in the morning in school. And the rest I don't even know what the heck are you talking (partly because I'm not so good at English) about and where have you gotten this information anyway? I personally stand for Ukraine because it's so wrong what Russia (or Putin to be exact) did to it, and I want to support all the innocent civilians. So if you stand for Russia you are supporting the killing of innocent people. Fuck you 🖕.Stay strong Ukraine 🇺🇦❤💪
How do you feel about reparations for black people in america? I'll wait
 @Melissa Windle  how many Americans has america murdered? I'll wait
 @Out of the box  Iraq dont count
I totally support Russia on this issue. Russia has every right to defend itself from the US and NATO aggression. Ukraine is the country that needs to be erased from the map. Russia is just teaching the west do not fuck with Russia. Russia 🇷🇺 and President Vladimir Putin has my support.
 @Anna Daniel  Are you mad ? What happend in 2014? Russia tore apart Ukraine . Russia is a murderer nation , they killed millions of European and oppresed small nation in 20.century.  My ancestors raped by 3 russian solders several times in 1945 . You represent what is wrong, what is barbarian , so most european do not like you! Russia has always been dictatorship , a cruel , barbarian country!
Putin attacking Ukraine. Russians vs their Ukrainian brothers. Not smart at all.
Don't forget that it was started by the Americans and NATO. of course I feel sorry for the people. But who watered the children in Serbia who died in the NATO bombing, the children of Syria, Libya, and other countries attacked by the Western alliance
 @Melissa Windle  Really? Ukraine didn't kill its own people? What about 100 people they burned alive in the city of Odessa????????
 @dejan jovic  If USA did so, than Russia has right to invade soveregin nation , and has right to kill innocents? What kinda moral do you have?
 @Alena  too much info
 @Sean Alvarez  да, насилие над жителями Донбасса, которое длится уже 8 лет
 @Neo Nationalist  at least Putin helped Syria
This is a small war. Ukraine joining NATO would eventually lead to world war.
 @norman clegg   don't forget Palestine
 @To  but why tho...same style and tactics....fight those who cant fight back? Preying on the weak
 @Andras Kleistenes  if that's true UN should let donetsk independence
😭😭😭
Nobel Peace Committee are you seeing this?? This is what happens when you give Peace prize to a politician. Now Mr. Putin wants to show to the world who is the actual keeper of peace or on whose shoulders the peace lies safely in Europe. May be you should consider giving Mr. Putin a peace prize. Or a joint peace prize to Mr. Biden and Mr. Putin but that will surely bring Mr. Trump into picture and you should answer him as to why he should not be given the peace prize. So committee, in view of so many families being affected you should revise your policies...I wonder if a prize return from his rival politician will satisfy Mr. Putin's ego...
 @Alena  Actually it was 40 pro Russian activists and that was 1918 you twit
 @norman clegg   Serbia 99 etc,
 @Abstern   the two states want to stay with Ukraine, Putin just declared them independent like he did Crimea. Russia is the aggressor, you either work for the Kremlin propaganda or brainwashed by russian state television
that house that was destroyed and shown at the beginning is a house in the Donbass or Luhansk and these are very old shots.  This is not Belgrade 99 bombed by NATO or Iraq, Syria, in the West everything is covered in blood, the Russians only hit flying targets, bypassing the cities, do not succumb to fakes.  I am not a supporter of Putin, on the contrary, but the truth is needed everywhere.
Yes this terrible! But I’m so glad the world didn’t sanction the United States after we lied on Iraq saying that we had intelligence that they had weapons of mass destruction(nukes), just so we could invade them and occupy their nation as a result we killed over 1 million Iraqis not to include over 4 thousand American service members dead smh! America seems just as bad as Putin, except America gets away clean with our dirt and Putin will not!
 @norman clegg   and Palestine!
I agree with you it must be horrible.It is always citizens that face the most horrendous consequences.
Let me repeat that the West, led by the Americans, did not start a violent change of government in 2014 in Kiev, in which Russian citizens were killed. and in other areas of Ukraine, it is also happening today. Putin endured that for 8 years, and begged both the Western powers and Ukraine to respect the Minsk agreement. and what the Western powers did, they began to send weapons, instructors to train them to kill the Russian people. @Andras Kleistenes 
 @Brian Welch  they were all warned numerous times by DoS to evacuate every single day for the last couple of months. So we shouldn’t feel bad..
 @Out of the box  who cares about Iraq, that's the past ancient history! Now let's focus on what's happening  at the present moment.
May be west should not have pushed spread of NATO everywhere after cold War...it was like trying to beat an already beaten snake. I don't know Possibly could have tired peace approach on the east than pushing vested interest. ..humanity can't afford a WW. 😞😞 peace.
Yep
 @R S K L  the reason why he brought up Iraq is because the act of the Iraq invasion by the U.S. was just as criminal as Russia invading Ukraine now. Tell me I’m wrong!
Hitler paid for his evil now it’s time for Putin
Yes
 @Out of the box  Iraq under Saddam Hussein was a bloodbath already, he was a mass murderer
Just when you thought the days of invading another country were over..
You didn't feel sorry for Iraq stfu
 @Factnomenal  worlds fucked mateWe should’ve learnt that by now
 @DAFENSHE✍  And Putin said that he wouldn’t invade Ukraine, and yet he did. There’s no reason to trust that big liar ever again!
 @Amie So sad that people don't even know what is happening with Iraq.
This war created by Boris Johnson and Biden given fake promises to ukraine president.  Ukraine president thought NATO , UK , US will help , however he made a blunder by provoking russia by this fake promise
 @dejan jovic   let's be clear : Ukraine a sovereign country , with plural democracy , Russia an authoritarian state . Ukraine might have made mistakes but  Russia does not have any right to invade a sovereign country, and killing innocents. We European must unite against Russia , otherwise we well be the next one . ( Only a few coutries are on Putyin's side , wich are  licking the dictators ass...  ) We have enough with Putyin , I hope USA + Uk + EU Will do serious action . We - the western democratic World 
 @appappaqjja  Did you create that profile name yourself, or did you get help making it? By the way, none of your sentences make any sense!
This is what Biden  said about Putin before he was elected:
 @Alena  А разве местных жителей Донбасса кошмарили украинцы или это делали сами мятежники и сепаратисты , приезжие ИХТАМНЕТЫ , разного рода кизяки и отпускники военные .Я за этим процессом наблюдаю восемь лет с самого начала событий и до сегодняшнего дня .
 @Preben Poe Jensen  it's make sense if your right and left cerebral hemisphere works . I bet you are the guy working on minimum wages
 @norman clegg   ya, they were invaded, but is there a way to condemn their Autocratic, Despotic tyranny the leaders of those countries were… they harboured known terrorists, inflicted incredible human rights abuse over their citizens. Ukraine is a Democracy with a, what we as the West see, as cooperation with other Nationalities, Trade and a Foreign, - Domestic Policy of an actual Constitution.
 @norman clegg   Add Syria, Yugoslavia, Serbia and Vietnam, and so many more.
 @Andras Kleistenes  democratic government lmfaoThat’s American narrative for I know $hit about what I speak so let’s just say we fight for democracy and freeeeeeedoooom.Ukrainian government came to be after an Obama US sponsored coup in 2014 to overthrow a legitimately elected government and installed a US nazi puppet, Zelensky.THAT’s US democracy!
Common bully Putin, give some nuke to that Ukraine, if you think you're powerful.
​ @Thomas Philidor  Putin has been warning the world for almost a decade, nobody listened, now that he is doing something everyone jumps on the band wagon. Yet America goes to war with everyone and continues to provoke but the world backs them. If you dig a bit deeper you will see what I'm talking about. The next move will be played by china in the coming months because they are just as annoyed with USA's involvement with everything. Don't get me wrong I'm sadden by the casualties and innocent people involved by this and it is extremely unnecessary loss of life but if the USA can focus on their own shit none of this would have happened, especially if Donald Trump was still in office
А когда бомбили Донецк и Луганск где вы были сочувствующие.
 @Bill gates 007  true
 @Sean Alvarez  У вас есть место с проверенными источниками?
 @Sean Alvarez  Это несправедливо, и я сочувствую людям, которые погибли, но CNN должен сказать правду и перестать быть проблемой. США вмешались и вызвали все это, и все же они хотят отступить.
 @Fernanda Cesar  Yes it is, Ukraine isnt looking after their people. War has been going on there since 2013
 @Neo Nationalist  thanks, at least one normal person in this comments section
 @SH HS  THANK YOU !!! FINALLY SOMEONE THAT READS BETWEEN THE LINES
 @Abstern   Thanks for spreading actual information!
 @Abstern   У меня есть и не один источник .
 @Andras Kleistenes  why are those not civilian people you dumb hypocrite
 @Preben Poe Jensen  Let the party of Satan Neto fall, and long live Russia and its allies
 @Preben Poe Jensen  Neto is a demon party that does not like good for peoples
 @LaSt PrAyeR-316  those million people in Iraq didn’t have anything to do with that attack it was you remember so called weapons of mass destruction! Hypocrite much
 @Kepler Mission  why
 @Abstern   А каким боком тут США , что-то я не наблюдаю там солдат НАТО или хотя бы ЧВК на стороне Украины .
​ @Forastero  from what news outlet do you get your information from?
 @Oleg Petrenko  state, province , region is the same thing
 @Preben Poe Jensen  Whoever spreads epidemics and diseases in Africa and the whole world, it is America and its allies. Whoever spreads Ebola in Africa, it is America. Whoever killed innocents in the Middle East, it is America. Whoever spreads Corona, it is America. Whoever spreads cancers, it is America. America is the biggest threat to the world.
 @alex lapping  🤣 totally
 @SpaceRanger  when did a million Iraqis attack USA it was so called weapons of mass destruction which USA never found but liked a million iraqis so this war is coming to their door step which everyone who was killed and bombed by USA and European allies are glad to be on the sides with Russia!
 @Abstern   until Russia’s pig snout there was peace and no BS you’re trying to make up
 @Marvhead  because there is not enough parking , but on a more serious note. Check who is feeding you the information and dig a bit deeper into whats actually happening
 @Melissa Windle  oh really!??
 @Preben Poe Jensen  Who is enslaving black Americans?It's America
 @Preben Poe Jensen  Whoever bombed Japan with a nuclear bomb, it was America
 @Preben Poe Jensen  And whoever polluted the oceans and lands with chemicals, it's America
 @Preben Poe Jensen  It is America who exterminated the Native Americans
 @Preben Poe Jensen  America's crimes never end
 @appappaqjja  You must be a comedian, though not a great one! I don’t recall that the Nato countries had promised Ukraine that they could join Nato in the nearest future. So according to Putin’s logic: because Nato wouldn’t give him any guarantees, he felt that he had the right to invade Ukraine? That’s absurd! And you made one more sentence which made no sense at all. Putin was clearly the aggressor in the resent days, the part who lied about not having any intention of invading Ukraine, and yet did it anyway. How is it possible that anyone can say that Putin wasn’t the one who provoked the other part in this conflict? So when your president is invading another country without plausible reason other than his lies, you just don’t care?!
😭😭🙏🙏🇺🇲🇺🇲
My heart goes out to Ukraine people prayer God bless all the people in danger   l am so sadly 🙏🙏😭😭🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
Yeah and people say war is good. 🤦‍♂️
 @DAFENSHE✍  I’m not a big fan of Nato either but it’s Trump talk to call it satan or demon!
very horrible and all natos fault.
 @DAFENSHE✍  I agree with you 100% in this matter!
 @Out of the box  What about Hurricane Katrina? What about the holocaust? What about the Hindenburg disaster? What about the great Chicago fire? What about the tsunami that hit Japan? What about the Challenger disaster?
I just watched Russian video about Russian protests in the Moscow. Ten of thousand are protesting against this war…
 @DAFENSHE✍  Again I aggree with you, both in the matter of the black Americans, the native Americans and the nuclear bomb. There are a lot of countries which have polluted the ocean and lands. USA is one of many but probably one of the worst due to the size of the country and its great echonomy.
 @def creator  how foolish one sound trying to justify bs for the same bs.....different toilet same shit
Keep in mind that this is a BBC video. They aren't all that trust worthy. They are known to regurgitate old footage and claim it as something else.
 @Preben Poe Jensen  dude . You still watching propaganda news from UK and US and Canda . All world is saying Russia has right to defend its borders . They run a resolution in United Nations,  8/10 countries said not interested in this topic . Ukrainian president done blunder by believing UK and US . GERMANY Already made deal about Nord Stream , Remebr this NORD STREAM 2 will be back in 2 years after the WAR . Stop watching Envlish propaganda news
What If this War Converted In A World War 🙄
 @Abstern   Do the Russian missiles know that?
 @Polymathic Talk  no one asked
 @Preben Poe Jensen  Thank you for the agreement. There are many who do not accept the truth and want to hide it
 @Preben Poe Jensen  The worst thing America did was spread cancer
 @Abstern   ypu are brainwashed by russian propaganda
And Ukrainian military
 @DG SUMIT  it won't convert world war because UK and US knows that if they bomb Russia,  Russia will send missiles to London and New York.  Its not Afghanistan.  As they know if we beat Russia , Russia will beat back . So we won't go for war
 @DG SUMIT  what if it does? Unless we can get most people to educate themselves as to genesis of this conflict. And not be too afraid to speak up against the neo-nazi right-wing extremists in Ukraine and their foreign supporters. There is nothing we can do except to wait for the nukes to fall and wipe most of us all out :(
 @George Cher  russia is a weak and poor country and it will only be weaker and poorer now. Rest of European countries? Which? The rest are a part of NATO and world war 3 would happen
Ohhhh shut up.....
 @appappaqjja  I don’t watch news from UK and US and Canada, very rarely. If you say that the whole world is saying that Russia has a right to invade Ukraine, you are out of your mind. If 8/10 countries say that they are not interested in this topic, that doesn’t mean that they support Putin. How did you come to that conclusion?
 @lifeonmars 10  Your compassion doesn't do anything for them. You're a human that has filth come out both sides.
SHUT it uP MAN
 @Neo Nationalist  Putin is a pig who has turned Russia into the worlds pariah. Disgusting to attack your neighbours with zero provocation.
Fear is illegal
What about Mordor's intervention in Gondor?
yes

we should be together in these times
not fighting each other about things from the past
to close the comment section
so people will just share love
 @Abstern   Well obviously you've been listening to good old Russian news, which explains why you think that.
at least
right here
Forza Ukraine
Yes
Had nato said they would not move missles to Ukraine Putin might not have attacked..,He will defend his borders unlike Biden...Ukraine will suffer due to Bidens ignorance,or maybe due to the fact this is what his masters wanted all along...war =$$ and the democrats love money more than country
Support Ukraine From Nepal 🇺🇦🇳🇵
Putin grrrrrr u know exactly what ur doing and putting both neighbours and all parts at war with your military ur a disgrace to the world putin !.pray  all affected
When America attacked Iraq ,Afghanistan, serya no wan stand with asiaYou European one day killed  by own people even United nation silent You have to type of humanity One for Europe one for middle east, and asia
Wait so is there no resistance from ukrainain army????Russia can just march in i did not knew that.
Stay strong Ukraine….. USA
Nato isn't gonna do shit! They're cowards  they would've already sent help, even usa , everyone is CLOSELY AND DECISIVELY watchinf
Western Ukraine Evil Putin is behaving exactly like what he is; a KGB Spymaster.
4:41 Then both parents ask, “where are NATO to help us?” More like you made that up!
Long live Russia .. 🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
russian cannot be trusted
Super frustrating Ukrainians didn’t listen to the warnings given by the west and are only running away now.Of course it’s not their fault but yea...  fuck Putin
Jesus is coming back soon are you ready?
So it begins. China vs Taiwan. Iran vs Israel. Etc. Ww3, 7 seals, etc. C u all in the Oasis
The begining of the end.
NATO backed Russia into a corner by not listening to their security concerns. They asked them not to allow Ukraine to join NATO, so they could be a buffer, and they wouldnt have to deal with NATO missles along the Russian border. They didn't listen, so now they are making a  buffer, and the Ukrainian people are paying the price for their terrible leadership and USA led NATO expansionism 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
When mother Russia visits you
Good ... Go Russia Go.  🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺 ..
Come on UN and America! stand up for your allies, This is not a time to be chicken shit to a Russian dictator!
Pray for all affected
Rusia kill NATO, break the new world order break UK and USA, destroy France and ISRAEL these are the axis of evil. Pakistan and Afghan mujahideen stand with Russia.LOVE RUSIA ❤️ LOVE Frm Pakistan 🇵🇰
Russia said it would not invade Ukraine………and they havent.
Whe need the return of nazi Germany ASAP, oh no......... his name is now OTAN.
NOW WE KNOW WHO THE ANTICHRIST IS......
Big love to Ukraine from Australia🇺🇦❤
Ukrainians were our former brothers.   Our Russian army is so power, they will reach kyiv if they want. But i don't like that. Same time  i don't want to see loss of Russians to NATO. I have to choose my motherland.
Fuck usa 🇺🇸 sleeping Joe usa this what usa want usa go and fight in USA not in Europe
Be bold be strong because the Lord our God is with you,prince of peace and judge of all men!✝️
If the west promised NO NATO, there would be NO war! After rejecting all Russia's security demands, why now regreting? America, NATO and Ukranian President is responsible for the consequences...If West involve with this, hope we can see a Nuclear War before die.
This is inhuman NATO should take immediate response to save Ukraine
Putin is our Hitler, the Adolf of our century, we don't need documentaries anymore, we experience his ideology on our skin !
He said he Had no such plans but that was until the west told him no to stopping ukraine joining nato.. I mean why would a country right next to russia want to join a governmental military organisation that  exists for north america and europe? . Thats like wales wanting to join the taliban its nuts that the news are saying putin had no reason when they refused to comply with putins security concerns... what did you expect.
I wish Vladimir Putin will also invade the NATO member Baltic countries...so that NATO will be forced to help Ukraine and fight Russia
Why NATO is silent and not doing anything to help Ukraine?
Putin seriously saying this was in self defence??!! Ukraine was Never ever going to attack or invade Russia! They posed no threat! This is like a 12 foot tall boxer punching a kid and saying “he was going to hit me”
If they just respected the Minsk agreements and gave guarantees of not joining Nato this wouldn't happen. But they are listening to neo-nazis from London and Washington...
NATO  should clear the airspace above Ukraine for safe international air travel.
I wish Russia never exist
Long live, the creation of the people's will,The united, mighty Soviet Union!!!
ezactly
 @Misanthrop !  thnx
You have a small brain man, NATO wants to bring Ukraine in and then install nukes pointed at Moscow just like they did in Romania and Poland
Why don't we sent our planes to fly above Ukraine and see what happens!!! Why are we not helping our neighbors???
Western propaganda is going on
Stop fighting in comment section Guys!!!!
Big love to the Russian government from India ❤️❤️
Big love to Ukrainian people ❤
I don’t get why nobody has tried to take him out. He’s a horrible human being who needs to be taken out
May peace  Prevail !
where were all the media when the west has been doing far worse to the middle east for decades
You should not envade other country like Ukraine.Thats their NATION not your country Russia.My heart goes to all Ukraine people Stay strong.Praying to all of you
Nato could have done more... arm them more. Make the red bear bleed...
No-Putin just want to run Ukraine as if it is Russia.
The clips are extremely disturbing 🥺🤣Lets pray for the best
Please stop this there is no need, there has been peace for so long just stop this please.
When a weak woke is ur president Then this happens.
Praying that God will calm Putin's heart
well... good luck I guess...
i don't see any comment from russian people. I am really curious how russian people feel about this war to be honest
So all those pot holes in the roads are strategically anti invasion protocol in the uk
He’s one hell of a liar and a butcher of the innocent.
There are
Select the newest first option and you can see it
From South Central L.A I wish I could kill help God speed Ukraine
I am glad the science still can't make people live forever, all dicators would die someday.
They can feel however they want. Doesn't make it true moron
So much for prayers I guess huh?This would have NEVER happened if the former President of the United States was still in office.The blame for this lays in the every idiot that for voted Joe Biden.He is a weak incompetent fool.50 years on Government and this happens within the first 14 months in office?!?!Inflation will now go through the roof.I hope fools are happy with your results..
The epic battle begins 🇷🇺 vs 🇺🇦
No aatyak Small Country , Worlds big countrys help, pisful  world's,
God bless Russia.
May Ukrainian citizens stay blessed and safe. The world will defend Ukraine against Putin's invasion. From this actions, Putin made clear that he is ready to face up any sort of severe consequences.
Putin has lost his mind, one of his lieutenants needs to serve him the 'special' tea.
We in Russia don’t want any war, we want to live in peace 🙏🏻
Amazing how the US and UK dragged the Ukranians to provoke Russia and pull them to Ukraine to make it as a trap on the expense of the Ukranian people. This will devastate Ukrane nomatter what the result of the war was. Just see what the UK and the US are doing to other nations in the rest of the world to see how Ukranians are destroying Ukraine by making problems to their neighbours to serve the British and American interests in weakening Russia. Let's wish luck to all on both sides, and let's hope Ukranian wise take over and put an end to NATO intervention in the ukranian internal matters and agree to not be a threat to the Russian security so they can be secure themselves.
I think problem is from NATO action.
Putin’s farfetched accusation of Ukraine being Nazi debunked. Ukraine’s President and PM are Jewish.This is projection from Putin - he is the Nazi.This is relevant to us in the West, because conservatives now copy Russian propaganda strategies. Look at ‘National Socialist Party’ on Wikipedia, it confirms the Nazi’s politics were FAR RIGHT. Ukraine’s government is progressive and left leaning. The ‘Socialist’ part of the Nazi Party’s title was a deliberate oxymoron, and is used by current far-right conservatives as an attempt to rewrite history.
Interesting how the civilians on all sides don't want this war, but their government leaders don't care
World leaders    ...    take a bow... you've all done very well  !
Rusia kill NATO, break the new world order break UK and USA, destroy France and ISRAEL these are the axis of evil. Pakistan and Afghan mujahideen stand with Russia.LOVE RUSIA ❤️ LOVE Frm Pakistan 🇵🇰
😠😠😠😠
Pray for al  Ukraine
Putin is new Hitler

Lame Troll
I hope you can find a way to get rid of parasite Putin. The Russian people deserve better.
Do you think west are innocent ?
There will never be true peace with Putin as your leader
Your president has a funny idea about living in peace
Unfortunately the KGB are unofficially running Russia through putin I feel for you, the Russian people are great folks. But the leadership is trying to bring back the union
Nik 047 no country is innocent, quit trying to justify invading and bombing Ukraine.
Wish I can nuke ur country Of course u people like war, don't act innocent, we know ur true intentions
 @Sonofa Seal  God bless Russia and Putin
 @Nik 047  No one's innocent lmao, war and humanity has always been the true devil.
You need to mobilize massively in the streets and show the dictator you're not okay with this at all
 @Kim Jong-un  Please do, I rather the whole earth enjoy a nice nuclear vacation away from humanity.
Who do u think is fighting in Ukraine,  it's Russia soldiers,  they are Russian people. U guys like war, now stop posting on social media pretending to be innocent
 @Anonymous  Do you remember 2003, what happened Iraq, how many civilians died, any country sanction against USA can you explain that
I hope and i pray you Russian can do something against this we need to save our world we stand with you but our politicians is devil we need to stop them we stand with you Russian as well with Ukrainian stay strong we stand with you, we don't want war
Sure. That’s what the Germans said: we didn’t want this. We didn’t know. The world didn’t buy it then , why should it buy it now?
 @Kim Jong-un  No one's innocent sir, we literally all need to not exsist. Earth can only take so much.
The Ukraine doesn't have a prayer against the Russian Army.
Why NATO and USA are just watching destruction. Needs action to stop USSR aggression.
West went to war based on lies. Why we crying now Russia are doing it??.....
The terror and sorrow on everyone's faces makes my heart wench for you! My heart goes out to all! May God be with you!

Putin will pay with his own blood for his insolence.
So this is how Putin said he wasn't going to invade. A cowardly murderer. I hope the Ukrainians give his troops hell
Tell the west stop threatening Russia
“Denazification” says the tyrant doing exactly what hitler did almost 100 years ago
Hitler Putin need to stop My prayers for Ukraine from Bangladesh 🇧🇩
THE BIGEST MISTAKE OF PUTIN! IS HETH AND! PUTIN IS A DEAD MAN NOW!

BBC bullshit
I told you... DONT POKE THE BEAR!!! AMERICA AND NATO THIS IS YOUR FAULT
Soviet attack Afghanistan
 @akabane karma  Afghanistan will stand with Russia to break USA and NATO 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Russia and Basar Al Asad killed Muslims in Iraq.Russia and China are killing old people.Taliban and Al Qaeda protect Afghanistan from America and Russia not Afghanistan's secular government
2022 and this is what we've come to. Putin has lost his mind and will forever be known as a warmongering monster. The russian people has a responsability to say enough is enough. These are your neighbours for gods sake
Now go for shit NATO membership, other countries should quit from this shit membership also.
Putin its a criminal... he kills civilians ..
Russia will fall hold on Ukraine the world's slow to help you im sorry
putler's terrorussia = n@zıs Germany
Well in the bible there will be a fireball falling in the sky and a mushroom shape aka nuclear bomb...
John 3:16 For God so loved the world He gave his only son Whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have an everlasting lifePlease accept Jesus as your saviour before its too late🙏
NATO led you to slaughter.  Dummies.
Why fight each other in this modern day and age, get over it, stop abusing your powers like a bunch of kids, have a chess battle with the Ukrainian leader, no innocent lives lost that way
No winner in a war. Only pain and suffering to people on both sides,  . Putin will go down in the history as the bad guy and he seems to be prepared for it. But the US and its European allies can stop to pretend to be gravely concern over Ukraine as they also have blood in their hands.  Stop all this BS.
praying for Ukraine 🇺🇦from the Philippines🇵🇭
May God be with Ukraine Had to delete my original post because of haters
west doing everything and anything to make separation in any case ..those are people from Ukraine  and selected Russsians ,do they tough about those Russians who suffer in Ukraine why they dont ask  Russian people in eastern Ukraine what they have to say ??? Dirty west as usually
stupid nato and western countries should not be trusted
Please don’t let that evil man putin destroy Ukraine!🙏
I hope Russian soldiers know why they are killing people and are happy dying for those reasons. Ukraine and NATO will not easily forgive
THE LIMELIGHT SHIFTS TO UKRAINE,, AND PEOPLE OF THIS WORLD FORGET ABOUT SYRIA, AFGHANISTAN , IRAQ , TAIWAN , BURKINA FASO , MALI, ETHIOPIA. The Russian civilians & military have seen how USA enters a theatre as a Liberator, and all God fearing Humans of this world dont utter a word. So Now its Russia's turn to masquerade as a Liberator
Let's not speak of surgical attacks that don't harm citizens. The US and it's lackey allies killed millions of innocent civilians in Afghanistan and all over the middle east, especially in Iraq!
They still don't believe it will happen 🤣🤣
omg if thay really wanted to attack you, you whould have real videos, not only sounds
I am Russian and feel frustrated and shocked the same. I did not want that! Suka blyat...(((
Stay strong Ukraine .God blessed you. 🙏🙏🙏
When America attacked Iraq ,Afghanistan, serya no wan stand with asiaYou European one day killed  by own people even United nation silent You have to type of humanity One for Europe one for middle east, and asia
It is so painful seeing an innocent country get invaded and worst of all not being able to do anything but watch
As Russia I completely agree, we don’t want any war. It’s our government who wants it
putin must have thought using word 
Following
Poor fool ukraine
PLEASE NUKE MOSCOW!!! Send in the saboteurs to give Russia some shit back!!
imagine there is no country.
I thought they have those javeling missile's
Ukraine is worse than Russia, the West is waging war in Russia, now they are just talking, they are not cooperating with Ukraine, the West is not a friend of Ukraine. Fuck America Israel
Rhetorical question.. This should have NEVER happened, so ask yourself why NATO allies and Biden-Democrats were so paralytic in simply leveling sanctions BEFORE bloodshed?
One man wanted to know where NATO was so they could protect them. Good question, where are they?
Don't understand some video show Attack happen night time some video showing Attack happen day time
Ww3 war of gog and magog repent Jesus is coming
The world is burning and people have forgotten that we are in the same boat 💔🥺
My heart aches for the people in Ukraine. God bless you all! I will be saying mighty prayers on your behalf.

Yep
I once had some respect for Putin.Now I know he’s a liar and a butcher.
Russians love Putin.
 @Nowhere Man  I’ll explain it to you like your 5 - Russia gives land as a present to Ukraine 1954- Ukraine wants to join nato - by joining the nato, America would build bases on the Russian and Ukrainian borders putting Russia at a disadvantage Now imagine gifting a gift to someone and that someone gifts it to your enemy.
 @Squishy  what are you on about this is war not gift giving
 @Squishy  Oh ? Is that what this is about ? I knew there was a good reason for president Putin's decision.
 @Magical Llamas  that’s analogy dnmbfnck
 @Squishy  why is Putin so threatened by NATO though.  They didn't shoot down a plane carrying 298 people heading for Malaysia.
 @Squishy  For those who ask: “Why does Ukraine matter? “ This is why Ukraine matters.It is the second largest country by area in Europe by area and has a populationof over 40 million - more than Poland.Ukraine ranks:1st in Europe in proven recoverable reserves of uranium ores;2nd place in Europe and 10th place in the world in terms of titanium ore reserves;2nd place in the world in terms of explored reserves of manganese ores (2.3 billion tons, or 12% of the world's reserves);2nd largest iron ore reserves in the world (30 billion tons);2nd place in Europe in terms of mercury ore reserves;3rd place in Europe (13th place in the world) in shale gas reserves (22 trillion cubic meters)4th in the world by the total value of natural resources;7th place in the world in coal reserves (33.9 billion tons)Ukraine is an important agricultural country:1st in Europe in terms of arable land area;3rd place in the world by the area of black soil (25% of world's volume);1st place in the world in exports of sunflower and sunflower oil;2nd place in the world in barley production and 4th place in barley exports;3rd largest producer and 4th largest exporter of corn in the world;4th largest producer of potatoes in the world;5th largest rye producer in the world;5th place in the world in bee production (75,000 tons);8th place in the world in wheat exports;9th place in the world in the production of chicken eggs;16th place in the world in cheese exports.Ukraine can meet the food needs of 600 million people.Ukraine is an important industrialised country:1st in Europe in ammonia production;Europe's 2nd’s and the world’s 4th largest natural gas pipeline system;3rd largest in Europe and 8th largest in the world in terms of installed capacity of nuclear power plants;3rd place in Europe and 11th in the world in terms of rail network length (21,700 km);3rd place in the world (after the U.S. and France) in production of locators and locating equipment;3rd largest iron exporter in the world4th largest exporter of turbines for nuclear power plants in the world;4th world's largest manufacturer of rocket launchers;4th place in the world in clay exports4th place in the world in titanium exports8th place in the world in exports of ores and concentrates;9th place in the world in exports of defence industry products;10th largest steel producer in the world (32.4 million tons).Ukraine matters. That is why its independence is important to the rest of the world.
Then do something about it. Your country is destroying everything the world has built since the Second World War. The failure of the Russian people affects everyone around them.
@Magical Llamas  hes explaining why putin want ukraine back ya dummy
 @Squishy  😮
 @Squishy  IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH JOINING NATO!!!! INFORM YOURSELF AMD DONT FOLLOW PUTIN LIKE A SHEEP!
Mr Putin might wants the best for his country, but I guess a growing number of russians are not too happy about the current situation and start thinking if it's so smart to let only 1 man sit with so much power.
I feel NATO should be held responsible for the war.
 @krunkle  Putin doesn’t want American bases built on the Russian borders, now if Ukraine joins nato it would be the perfect opportunity for the us to build bases
It's never the citizens who want war. It's always the leaders who do, and they have no qualms with sending thousands to die and killing thousands of innocent people for the opportunity to stroke their fragile egos...
Everybody wants peace, it's the politics that are eager for war.
 @Squishy  ☠USA does the same thing.  The list is waaaaay to long.
 @Carla V  GO KISS YOUR DADDY BIDEN WITH THAT  MOUTH OF YOURS LMAOOOOOO
 @krunkle  it's because Putin is a paranoid psychopath
 @Squishy  Understandable. I think my biggest issue us that Putin made an side note of his country's nuclear capabilities if NATO was pushed.  If he doesn't want Ukraine to join NATO, Ukraine needs to be left alone.
 @krunkle  Ukraine was alone until it had the idea to join nato, and Putin would definitely not allow that by any means cause it would give the US opportunity to build American bases on the Ukrainian borders.
 @Carla V       ???????????     Industry in the East in Lugansk and Donetsksame as coal mining...Nuclear power plants put there by RUSSIA .
 @Squishy  I hope it could be reversed, and that NATO isn't heavy handed in reacting to the bombings.  It's in the world's best interest that neither NATO and Russia enter Ukraine and leave asap.Idk it might end with Ukraine feeling betrayed though, that the West gave up on it, even if it's for avoiding conflict with Russia.
 @Squishy  just say dumb fuck or are you incapable
 @Magical Llamas  probably was a typo relax American
 @Squishy  
 @UK man loves goddesses  Russians would have another member of an opposing military alliance directly on their border. One of the promises that nato made was not to expand eastward which they did. While nato also being an anti Russian alliance, adding Ukraine would give nato a second larger border which is closer to Russia’s most populous regions
 @UK man loves goddesses  if you still don’t understand my explanation you’re more likely the problem
​ @Squishy  more like your explanation is dumb BS. Just say why Ukraine being in NATO is bad for Russia
 @drShrute e  chill out dude mind ur own
 @UK man loves goddesses they wrote a whole explanation  “Russians would have another member of an opposing military alliance directly on their border” which is Ukraine
 @Magical Llamas  ok naive little kid 🥺
 @UK man loves goddesses  already explained why Ukraine joining nato is bad for Russia, your cell depleted little brain probably missed out on that
 @drShrute e  :)
I don’t see any fire
Yep, people are stupid so I'm not surprised. You will not see me take a weapon and kill someone in peace or war, I don't care who calls it, unless earth is invaded by aliens, then I will go on front line. As you said, we are all in the same boat, and instead of collaboration to take this boat somewhere nice, we drilling holes and sinking it.This made me think, maybe we are alone in the universe after all, leaders know that and thats why they looking to take land from someone else, maybe we can't go deep into space, maybe space isn't deep as they say, they know that, and that's why they all fight for land on earth. When there is plenty of food, nobody fights, but when there is little food left, then every fight for it, same with land in earth, there is no planet we can move to they know that that's why all fights for this piece of land.
stop overracting.
 @Oxy Gen  we are the fire lmao, shall we just go kill off more ecosystems for expansion?
Hippie
Your heart aches? Laaaaammeeee
Long Live Russia 🇷🇺. Love From Pakistan🇵🇰.

Praying for everyone in Ukraine.From China.
Never be a friend of US. They never help
are the Ukrainians not putting up a resistance? I know their were a lot of citizens of Ukraine who were getting ready to fight.
Where is American?? 🤣🤣 just talk
🇷🇺❤️
Ukraine - current prey of USAUSA triggered ukraine to join in NATOIf ukraine join NATO, USA can deploy their troops on russian border and threat russiaSo Russia reacted to safeguard themselvesUSA is the basic reason for all the war in earth currently, that cunning fox needs to be punishedWhatever the reason, killing civilians can't be justifiedRussia please don't follow like America, killing innocent people in middle east countries
 @FOUZAAN  🇷🇺💔; 🇺🇦❤️
 @Mr.Kongunadu  the funny part is USA always trying to get this world at war like Last time ISIS, and the truth about It is actually USA is behind that. And now Ukraine..Russia dont want Ukraine to Join Nato as simple is that, you can not win against Russia, no Way!And i agree USA need to get some lesson one day either from Russia, china or North korea
 @wendy widjaja  Well said wendyAmerica will get their punishment soon
Afghanistan 2001 ...Iraq 2003 ....Libya 2011  Western Civilization   ???????
 @norman clegg   whataboutery is no argument
Sorry all Ukrainian, you are making enemy by bringing missiles in the borders from USA
 @Bonny Hammer  sorry but he's 100% right
They got their lessons from the United States.
Where was your anger when América and nato attack syria and other country
 @Jedi Maibam  A line needs to be drawn. NATO troops must be sent to the front line. Enough is enough. If we keep showing weakness to Putin he will keep coming back
 @Tom Hill  do you think Russia needs lessons? Grow up. Civilians are going to die over this empire building by Russia and all you care about it what about this, what about that.
 @Bonny Hammer  NATO is not an agent of peace. It is an anti-peace alliance.
USA attacked and destroyed countries which are 10k miles away from their (usa) borders, claiming fight for freedom, Russia is attacking neighbour Country which wants to join enemy alliance. So tell me, who is right. I feel sorry for all innocent people there, and see WW3, but I understand putin and his concerns, he has more right to attack than usa ever had before. Ukraine already had promise of security from EU, Russia and USA, and they still poke a bear and wanted to join Nato, why join Nato when you are already promised security from everyone, probably government paid by West, its all about money.
 @Samir Dončić  Why we all just need to perish off this planet. Humans will never stop, and it's actually killing our planet. Nuclear winter for all
国内都是赞扬普京的
Praying  ..for Russians .. 😭🇷🇺
The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures;he leadeth me beside the still waters.  He restoreth my soul; he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name’s sake.  Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies; thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.  Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life; and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.”  ~ 🙏
Praying Russia gets an easy win so you can conquer Taiwan next? Screw the CCP.
 @FOUZAAN  really 🙄
 @Anonymous  You should congrats Biden and Nato as theirs wish came true. Ukraine and Russia are both victims of the war game planned by Nato and US. Don't act innocent and live like a false saviour of the world.
 @Haku Yuki  Yeah .. Certainly ...As a human , everyone should firmly stand with Russia .. 🇷🇺
​ @Anonymous  We shouldn't judge people based on their country of origin and their associated governments. When I meet an American, I don't assume he supported the invasion of Iraq; when I meet a Chinese person, I don't assume she supports an invasion of Taiwan at all costs, regardless of Taiwanese sentiment; and in the future, when I meet Russians, I won't assume they happily supported this current bloodshed. We are all citizens of the world first and foremost, and we should be working together. To hell with nationalism.
 @FOUZAAN  why is that?
God i feel bad for anyone who has to hear those sirens.
Citizens of the world !!! Please please do NOT let little men with little penises rule over you. They have issues that will lead to this kind of disaster. Hitler, stalin and now Putin all of them little men probably with very very tiny penises.
Well Ukraine a part of NATO so you can’t expect NATO to just be there
And the rest of the civilized world watches ...... im so angry right now
Prayers for the people . God is watching !
Putin has special place in hell for sure.
Putin = dictator. Where are the nazis and the genocide ? What we see is a democracy attacked by Soviets. Shame on you Russia .....
As a human, am sorry for Ukrainians...but you shouldnt have invited USA and Nato to your country...there was no need for that....
For eight years, Ukraine has been killing the peaceful population of Donbass. Europe and the USA did not notice this. The blamed Russia for everything. Everyone was poking stick at the bear. And now the bear has been waking up in winter. The Russians have been suffering for a long time, but when they made a decision, there is no way back. There are independent journalists who shoot reports in hot spots, for example, a journalist from the USA Patrick Lancaster, he shows every day what was happening and is happening in the Donbass. Find it on YouTube. According to the link, the video about the boy killed by the OSCE drone did not even appear : https://youtu.be/7xzrpCGJIZE
no worry. Israel hits everyday  on Syria like this.
This happens due to greede of nato alliance , now i wanna.ask where is.nato .
Guys move out of the city to countryside
Because of president of ukeren
Putin will launch a nuclear strike.Western countries. It's new Hitler.You are terribly cowardly people,both Europeans and Americans.You are despised.Kyiv.😔🇺🇦
prayers for Ukraine and Palestine - under the same injustice
i heard the uk is going to send 5 armoured divisions and 10 infantry divisions.
Тузы делят зоны влияния, а страдают люди

I do see Putin's point. If Russia tomorrow would announce that they are deployingtroops and bases to Mexico how would America react or if russia made a alliance with venzuela,cuba and brazil and then deploy troops and bases, how would the US react ? Logically we wouldn't like it. At the peril of being blasted at any point, I fully agree with the Russians position. Use diplomacy, try to work things out and hopefully there will be no war. If Russia does invade let Ukraine defend themselves. It's their country and their problem for making crimea starve to death and die of thirst by cutting 90% of the water supplys and making russia waste billions to try and fix the situation oh and when Russia tries reaching out to Ukraine to make a deal they ignored em sooo yea.Anyone in Europe willing to go to war over Ukraine? I doubt it, France will be the first to look for a reason not to fight. And if some nationes really go to war lets be honest Russia is gonna step on them with their superior artillery fire power,Infantry training,tactics etc , everyone saying russia is bad when in reality the Ukraine started it, isntead of listening to Russia and opening the water supplies, another thing is, dont let Ikraine join nato, if they dont join russia wont invade probably.And if Ukraine becomes part of nato then simple,  let Russia put down bases in Cuba,Venezuela and brazil As a simple as that cause fun fact the US isn't letting the  venzuela president,cuba and brazil go to Russia to talk with putin, why ? Cause they know Russia is in the right of invading to protect their national security.Prayers to Ukraine and hope this ends soonBut in the mean while the other nations shouldn't interfere,just let it happen and only suply weapons to Ukraine
NATO sleeps well. .....idiot impotent USA, UK
No clown,praying does not stop wars.
Long live USSR.
God bless you ukranian
I FEAR PUTINS WAR WILL BE NUCLEAR. HE DOES NOT CARE FOR LIFE HE CARES FOR BEING IDOLIZED LIKE HITLER
Start bombing there asses I bet you they won’t like it.
I feel uncomfortable having my gender run countries especially when the country has nukes
Bider is looking for ice cream.
Should we regret persuading Ukraine to de-nuclearise?
Putin said 
Pray for everyone in the Ukraine from Japan 🇺🇦🤝🇯🇵
The Nazis are back
Putin is an evil man. Fighting against the growth of the neighbouring country has no issues with him.
My heart goes for the citizens of Ukraine my GOD bless you ♥️♥️♥️
You were warned not to poke the bear 🐻
You can thank Merkel. Biden, Pelosi, Schumer, Granholm, Kerry, AOC, Bernie Sanders and feel free to include whomever else you can think of for this green new deal shit that’s punted the world’s gas tanks into Putin and OPEC’s arms..
Almost nobody supports these actions in mainland Russia
Can Someone stop this evil Putin ?
Pray for everyone in the world. Here is my assessment of what could have prevented a war between Russia and Ukraine that the media is not telling you. Let’s have a debate by commenting on this video, watch this clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dURbVp6gM0
Well... You're Japanese.... Can't you get your country and also China to threaten Putin, he'll stop if China threaten him.Along with all the other countries on Ukraine's side, Putin won't stand a chance
 @🌟 𝕋 𝕀 𝔻 𝔾 𝕐 ✓  do u really think that china will THREATEN russia
 @🌟 𝕋 𝕀 𝔻 𝔾 𝕐 ✓   China won't threaten Putin - they are his allies. China want Ukraine to be invaded so that the West will be distracted enough for the Chinese to invade Taiwan.
 @🌟 𝕋 𝕀 𝔻 𝔾 𝕐 ✓  what? How would one citizen do that? China supports Russia.
 @🌟 𝕋 𝕀 𝔻 𝔾 𝕐 ✓  you expect he's the son of president or something?
 @🌟 𝕋 𝕀 𝔻 𝔾 𝕐 ✓  If anything China will side with Russia
Get your Imperial catboys ready dude, russkis gonna com fo you (*^o^*)

'Horrifying Moment' Russian Bombs Drop All Over Ukraine https://youtu.be/ApuUWKuTJzw
Don't worry your country will be next
I’ll pray for Japan
 @🌟 𝕋 𝕀 𝔻 𝔾 𝕐 ✓  Japan and China don’t get along
Honestly, you have no right to say that. China and Japan both support Russia
japan world war 2 killed lots of people… i very happy american attacks on japan with nuclear weapons… america hope again attacking on japan with nuclear weapons
 @🌟 𝕋 𝕀 𝔻 𝔾 𝕐 ✓  loooooolz everybody enjoyed bombing on iraq,afghanistan,syria....libiya...millions death .70% of them were women and children.....though west believes in women empowerment and equality..........................

 @RUST Funny  i dont understand.ukraine is close to israel.why israel is silent?
Fuck Russia and China
 @LeVi AcKerman  duck the US and canada
 @saruwarjahan sagor  lol ok.
 @LeVi AcKerman  China does make things for US, so it has that.Russia is just sad that USSR is gone.
 @🌟 𝕋 𝕀 𝔻 𝔾 𝕐 ✓  japan is a faithful dog, these kawaii people don't have any men to deploy
We stand with Russia
 @🌟 𝕋 𝕀 𝔻 𝔾 𝕐 ✓  Japan doesn’t have an active military, it disbanded it after WW2 also other than threatening Vladivostok Japan couldn’t do anything with a military
 @🌟 𝕋 𝕀 𝔻 𝔾 𝕐 ✓  So…are you going to your country’s leader to do something?
 @LeVi AcKerman  hahaha.. why no want to war with Russia and china?? this is not iraq n afghanistan
 @Disco Stick  Japan doesn't, what are you talking about? They've already joined in to try and break russias economy
 @🌟 𝕋 𝕀 𝔻 𝔾 𝕐 ✓  Well he isn't president or anything. Neither Japan could persuade China to stop Russia. If anything China will use this chance to invade Taiwan.

 @Ricky Barrientos  Japan and China gets more friendship than Korea
 @Disco Stick  ??? Even a lot of people within Russia don’t want war
 @🌟 𝕋 𝕀 𝔻 𝔾 𝕐 ✓  China is hand in hand with Putin.
❤ 🇯🇵
Deranged Putin is determined his country be viewed as the villains of this planet once again.
“A snarling russian leader”  snarling? Really? Come on BBC, no need to be so exaggerate! Ffs
I am laughing so hard i don’t know why😅
This is just barbaric. I wish the others would do more to actually help Ukraine. Like someone else said, sanctions won't stop Putin from continuing to shell Ukraine. People are already dead thanks to this.
ARE WE SERIOUSLY STANDING BY AND WATCHING THIS SHIT????????? FUCK MAN. WE NEED TO PROTEST IN OUR COUNTRIES FOR THIS WAR TO STOP!!!!! IF WE CAN DO IT FOR PALESTINE WE CAN DO IT FOR UKRAINE 🇺🇦 💪
1:09 you have a new message on viber
Utter waste NATO 🤮
its funny Putin doesn't worry about nukes on the border when the nukes are held by the Chinese who have a claim to Vladivostok and the Russian far east, yet he wants people to believe that he was worried about Ukraine and its not just a plot to invade another country . Hes a complete liar , he said he wasn't planning a invasion , the British and Americans were called warmongers for saying he was planning a attack well he just proved them right
Putin is just another monster
Russia will be dispised by many countris becose of the stupid leader.
Allah save Ukraine. Azerbjan pray for Ukraine 🇦🇿🇺🇦
🇷🇺❤️🇷🇺❤️🇷🇺❤️🇷🇺❤️
Russia 🇷🇺🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍👈🏼👈🏼
This is NATOS fault for constantly expanding NATO towards Russia over Russias objections. Idiots
Russians should really be proud of their leader. Man has got the blood of man on his hand.
NATO thought bullying putin is fun !! Putin is that quite kid in american school
Russia will bring victory we don’t want NATO taking over our world with the OIL DEMOCRACY AMERICA
Should of let them into NATO while there was still time to prevent this…
Problem is if you have military intervention it will end up in a world war and we will all die, because someone would use nuclear weapons.
 @Margaret Zoheir  Putin first.  He's a madman.
Well Putin just use west medicine.... Nothing more, nothing less... I was in the same position like Ukraine people, just attacked by Nato. But outcome is the same. Big boys play war, people suffer...
 @Margaret Zoheir  Yeah, which is frustrating, but that's exactly what I'm worried about. There's a-holes all over the world, a lot of people didn't learn from history. Except now, if we have another world war, that's likely to be the end of humanity. I don't mean full military engagements - but sending support, aid,  supplies, etc, that I would think is more feasible. I'm just frustrated that this psycho has us all in this position in the first place, we could have prevented it.
Prayers to both countries citizens. After all, they are the ones who end up suffering.
This is an attack on democracy, a world without it is not one I wish to be apart of. We must defend it, we must help those who are in danger of having their freedom striped away. We cannot stand idly by. Good luck Ukraine, the world will not forget about you 🇺🇦🇬🇧
When this is over Ukraine will no longer be independent. This is Putin annexing Ukraine by force. Dont believe his lies.
Too much talking from the West. This looks like Hong Kong all over again. IMO!!!🤦🏾
I look forward to seeing Putin and his various cronies and lapdogs at the Hague warcrime tribunal, in years to come.
im chinsese and it looks like im the only one supporting russia
America, your UK and west wrote the narrative and Putin is only making the movie. This is a war west wanted and rooted for. Don’t act innocent
He says 
Now is the best time to attack Russia the majority of his forces and equipment ain't at home protecting Vladimir Putin
Putin will launch a nuclear strike.Western countries! It's new Hitler.You are terribly cowardly people,both Europeans and Americans.You are despised.Kyiv.
Russia should be kicked out of any sporting tournament any country that do deals with them should stop or face the same punishment..hit Russia financially and any Russian that are against what Putin stands for should turn on him
Let us all unite and fight the Rusian people!
American cause it why not send all of your Force there
Praying for all of Ukraine.. 🙏🏼
This reminded me of the American bombing of Baghdad during 2003 ...👉🏻👂🏻
Needed to covered and safely
Best of luck for all who have to endure this, from Germany.
You mean americas version of democracy which is facism in disguise? They couldn’t stop black Americans being murdered in public but can rile up when Russia stirs
Stop your  propaganda campaign
 @Lycan_system  this isn't about Americans.  What the fuck is wrong with you?
 @Lycan_system  how about you guys go and live in communists countries like Russia north Korea and China go there and don't come back if democracy is so bad for you
First punish your own war criminal, Tony Blair, rhen accuse others
Your definition of Democracy is to suppress minority , So, Russia has every Right to defend herself.
Yes we all saw the freedom and democracy you gave to Iraqis by killing 1 million innocents, or we know how you care about democracy by selling weapons to Saudis to commit genocide in Yemen. I think Most of the world would disagree with your statement
Yeah, let's all get together and have a good scrap!!
 @Javier Harth  ikr! Exactly what we all need!

I think action is better than just wishing luck
If germany says best of of luck you know you're fucked....
Germany in ww2: occupies half of Europe Germany now: Well guys we could help but you know we are peaceful so yeah best of luck lolI am not saying that germany should occupy half of Europe or that ww2 was justified I am just saying that germany has full capability to help Ukraine
Putin is freemasonic..just like most world leaders are ..we been played for long time .even ww1 and 2 were created by them...new world order.
Lol
 @shelby speaks  indeed 😭
 @shelby speaks  Why?:(
 @knorpell je  because even Germany, a super strong and rich nation is afraid of your enemy
 @THE DUDE  this sounds absolutely crazy, but I wouldn’t be too surprised. And something about the way this report was filmed seems a bit off to me
 @L1  truthers warned of this years ago..and COVID..all planned decades ago . The Great reset.... I even guess the day it wud start..apart from 33 ther fave number.. 322 (skull and bones) ..23.2.2002.
Soon we will ALL be in need of tremendous endurance. I say to you as a German, prayers for endurance through this mess. The pipeline into Germany will be a big hit for Western Europe. Putin announced yesterday, I believe that he will NOT be selling fertilizer to Western Europe now either. Please prepare for shortages to get bad. Each westernized country is in deep and imminent danger of one thing or another. Here in US we have our own issues. And they start withthe UN, WEF and  Washington DC and it will end with empty stores and pockets of major civil unrest. Martial law is soon coming to ALL our countries. God Bless Friend. 🥰
Germany kill 20 million Russia Ukraine people
 @Nofa Susanto  yeah, I don't why hitler hated white people so much...😂
 @Anonymous one  global civil war
People do realise this guy making a YouTube  comment can't - A. Help out Ukraine and B. Didn't start the world war,  Hitler did.
Every Country to develop Nuke weapons to Save it from attack
Russia need only two days love Russia from India 🇮🇳
Well once again we edge towardsWw3
i knew putting NATO at the russian borders would have consequence.NATO backtracked on every agreement not to extend NATO into Eastern Europe.this is the end result.
ПТН ПНХ
The world is a mess; one small issue or one small war can trigger the whole world and turn into chaos
I will say this. If international organisations like Nato and the UN does not step up and take assertive action then all faith in them will be lost.
Ukraine.. Don't believe US and EU...
Where is NATO now?...USA?....All cowards!...All afraid of Russia
God be with us! Help our Ukrainian people and my country! Pray for Ukraine🙏🙏🙏
I read your comments and am horrified by your stupidity. you just don't know anything about the real reasons for what is happening. The fault is not Putin and Russia, but the United States and Nato, which has cornered Russia leaving no other choice. What were you hoping for when you poked a sleeping bear with a stick?
the monster aggressor playing to be a victim wow!!!
Thanks BBC, we don't get any good world news in the USA anymore, so I have to go to BBC to see what's going on in the world.
I feel sorry for Zelensky , is he the pawn?Too much reliance on NATO ?OR Is it a failure to maintain neutrality?😢😢😢

Plz stop RUSSAI AND UKRAINE don't fight isnt good
They're targeting the airports firstJust like they did to Donetsk Airport
Help the people of Lugasnk and Donetsk from Kiev AZOV shelling .
Classic invasion tacitc.Control the air,control the sea,control the land
Will zelensky disappear in a private jet filled with cash and gold?
Don't blame Putin because you don't understand the history of politics.Ukraine belongs to Russia Ukraine has never been independent, this all started with Biden trying to rule Ukraine because off the North stream pipeline and Europe,Biden with draw all there troops last year from Afghanistan, to start war with Putin it was all planned out from before sins Biden came into office.Putin is only protecting what belongs to Russia and always did and that's Ukraine and Biden wants to control it.Before you point finger at Russia learn your history and see how toxic America always been and always interfering with other countries business when there own back yard is a mess.I hope China will support Russia in this war and rightfully defend Ukraine from the USA and Nato.Trump warned us all this will happen if biden gets in office.
Why aren't they firing back?
Soviet Union build Ukraine not zelenky the criminal 🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺

Long live mother russia 🇷🇺
Maaaan wtffff this is getting real, the west really needs to stand up for ukraine if they want to hold up their dignity
Well you can hate him or like him but one thing is clear, Putin has a big pair of jewels.  Unlike the guy in white house
USA led Ukraine to slaughter. Dummies.
Ukraine leader fear for his job?  More like his life.  Thanks Joe Biden...
Also, I feel really bad about how the integrity of BBC just disappeared
We are taking many back steps in achieving world peace
Kia Kaha Arohanui from New Zealand. #standwithUkraine
Support and Love from NYC. I am speechless .. Strength to you all.
🤬 Russia
While I feel horrible for the innocent citizens of Ukraine, I can't help but to feel that it was the only way Russia can stand up to the most evil country the world has ever known 
My prayers go out to the people of Ukraine. This is just wrong, but what do you expect from a dictator like Putin.
I am sure the BBC counted the burned bodies in Odessa when Ukrainian Neo-Nazis burned them alive.
Now we know why Trump tried to destroy NATO. His master wanted it destroyed so he could invade Ukraine without consequences. Didn't work. Trump never succeeds.
The west has become a hedonistic materialistic decadent coward bunch of nations.The backward Taliban are more brave .

Where america troops?
Lay down your arms
God bless Ukraine
支持乌克兰 领土完整 ，主权独立 。Support Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereign independence.
Meh
This is satan movement
That old man is right if Putin is not stopped now WW3 could start. China will make Thier own move next
Unfunny fact, The world is far closer to nuclear war now under Biden than it ever was under Trump.
hey❤ryou might not believe this, butrJesus loves yourHe's coming back againrhave a wonderful day my friend
i hate russia
Hoping History won’t repeat itself! Ukraine 🙏 Hopefully Putin will be stopped before it gets really worst!
finally Nazi are running  rats from ukraine 🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
Prayers won't save Ukraine, only Western military support and intervention (which isn't coming) will.  But my heart goes out to the Ukrainian people who were just trying to live in peace and freedom in the shadow of Moscow's brutal dictatorship.
Good.....
Serbian tactic of self-defense
We do not want war. It may not end well. The whole world will suffer of the aftermath of whatever is happening right now. My prayer goes for both the Ukrainian and Russian.
The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures;he leadeth me beside the still waters.  He restoreth my soul; he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name’s sake.  Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies; thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.  Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life; and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.”  ~ 🙏

Hi. Just balancing out the comment from the jerk who replied to you with something pleasant. Hope you have a great day! I'm sure you're a cool person.
 @William1w1  just report that Russian bot for harrassment
You can't encircle Russia and expected everything will turn out peaceful?
 @KK Daze  no one was encircling Russia why on earth would NATO or America attack Russian on a normal day. Thier citizens would never accept it and they are a democracy
You must be dumbass to wish for West to aid openly Ukraine with military forces. This would start fuckin WWIII. Ukraine main problem is not being part of NATO and that was also the reason Putin attacked Ukraine, Ukraine which was getting closer to Western zone of influences (UE, NATO etc.). This would make NATO flank right next to Russian border.
 @Lx Dead  you’re right about it starting WW3 but at the same time it still can happen
Sounds like war mongering. It is not the job of the west to be world police. Cucks argued this for the last 20 years but now its ok?
 @Lx Dead  Ukraine had the right to join any alliance it wanted it, British PM announced possible military intervention! Just wait!
Wars of Conquest - what every Autocrat wants to do.
anyone with a brain would've invaded ukraine if u were in russias situation
 @xWinter  So you want to place a gun to every person's head in the world and kill them more quickly then? Because that is what will happen if NATO fully goes to war with Russia. Ukraine deserves to defend its sovereignty and I have a burning hatred for those that initiated this war but the US will not and cannot sacrifice the world for one country.
The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures;he leadeth me beside the still waters.  He restoreth my soul; he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name’s sake.  Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies; thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.  Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life; and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.”  ~ 🙏
If you like them so much why dont you go fight for them yourself dweeb.
 @Lx Dead  Maybe it was not that wise from president Zelenskyj to tell at Munich security conference last week, that Ukraine will build own nuclear weapons again.
 @Lx Dead   Yeah but it dosen't make it better, It dosen't justify these actions acoarding to the minsk agreemnt and the international law, Countries can't just go anarchist 
not coming, so how do we make it come? I don't know the answer, but I refuse to believe that the everyday people of the world are powerless to do something! The Ukrainian people voted overwhelmingly for independence from Russia, we as the world, have a responsibility to defend them in that decision they made. If we don't, this doesn't stop here! It sends a clear message to dictators they can do whatever they like if they just single out a country & make other countries feel like there's no threat to them.First they came for the disabled, I wasn't disabled so I did nothingThen they came for.......When they came for me, there was no-one left to stop them
 @Max Powers  you remember what happened in 1939 when nazis decided to invade Poland and USA, France and Britain stepped aside.
 @epic  Your logic makes so much sense!!!!
 @Eli Le scholten  nobody invaded Cuba or Mexico or any other country which were supported by USSR.
 @Eli Le scholten  Whatever that means? Western European countries are not invading their neighbors. England is not attacking Ireland. The US is not invading Canada. If you believe Putin's lies that that Ukraine started a war that will end up in its own destruction you are brainwashed by the Kremlin.
@Red Tiger Yep it does. Don't call for a world war unless you're willing to suffer and die for it. If you think others will fight your wars for you you're gravely mistaken.
Yeah, great idea as the psychopath in the Kreml did already threaten anyone stepping in with unprecedented retaliation. You do remember that the guy has nukes, right? Do you also know what happens when the first nuke is dropped (no matter if in russia or in a NATO country)? Right, total annihilation as it would trigger a response with every nuclear weapon that is ready to be launched. And this is something no one on this planet will survive.And I do hope that this is very present in the minds of all political leaders of this world as otherwise, things will get grim very, very quickly.
 @svenhaanautomation  yes, all world is kept as hostages because putin has nuke.
 @Shamil Mammadov  this is a very correct assessment of the situation. But would you like to be the one testing out if the threats were serious?
 @xWinter  It wont, as long as West wont do anything stupid as openly aiding Ukraine with military forces. Putin wont attack Poland nor any other NATO member - he knows he can't. He is securing though countries that were not part of it, so the buffer zone between Federation and NATO will stay the old way. Ask Yourself what USA would do if Mexico or any other country nearby, like Cuba, would like to join Russian Federation and started to make some anti-rocket projects. Reaction would be the same. STAY COLD HEADED.
 @Andrea Hoffman  Ukraine was too naive believing in treaties when they gave up all the nukes in 1994 (If I remember it correctly). If they'd had one, Putin would be much more cautious.
 @Red Tiger Gaming  Yeah, but as You can see treaties means shit. Poland experienced it in 1939 and 1943 and 44. If Ukraine wouldn't gave up their nuclear nukes, Putin would be more cautious about any conflicts, but since they gave it up, they have nothing.
 @svenhaanautomation  I understand the west. Only Russians citizens can get rid of putin and only them can help Ukraine.
 @Derek Hale (Love,banter,fun)   Sure, they had, but NATO laws says it clear: country CAN'T be in ANY ongoing military conflict, in which Ukraine was. They could become part of NATO, but it's too late and since Putin knew that, he did what he did. As for Brits, they are courageous and cocky when it's not about their lands and civilians getting killed and possibly erased with nukes by Russia. They once brought Poland to war, in which it was left alone.
 @svenhaanautomation  I’m not quite qualified to make this kind of decisions. But I understand your concerns as well.
Russia repeatedly acting like NATO countries. NATO countries started war against Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq, Labnan, Syria and Lybia etc. and killed millions, Looted assets, formed puppet Governments.
Most russians don't support Putin. We support peace 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
🇷🇺💪🏻Let's go
Russia personal carrier almost rear-ended each other now instead of watching stupid Russian civilian crashes. I get see stupid Russian solders wrecking in combat.    Since praying for peace didn't work I'll pray that every Russian solder catches a bullet like the common cold
It is very very sad to look such horrible circumstances in the 21st century! United States can clearly stop this but it's incompetent and weak president doesn't have B A L L S to do anything
🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺😢
Please stop this we all want to live on mother earth🌏
I'm remembering the days when US and it's allies invaded Iraq, afganisthan, syria, libya
Ah yes, de-nazifying Ukraine
Am  a Zambian YouTuber and I must say that those people in the War Zone deserve to live as much as everyone else! Big powers must stop being Greedy! and sit on the Table with Russia, and solve this problem! There is no winner take all here! Just Sit Down! Talk! and find where you meet each other!!!!!! & End this War!!

The JTRIG unit of GCHQ is so notable because of its extensive use of propaganda methods and other online tactics of deceit and manipulation.

The time has come for the west and all free peoples of the world to unite and end the reign of despotic authoritarian leaders. Ukraine must stand and we must stand with her.
🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
This is world war three…wait till the Islamic world takes over…
Welcome to world war 3
God's intervention in eastern Europe, God's intervention in the whole World. Jesus Christ is the answer let's run to Him.
Mfw Russia invaded Afghanistan too, and more recently also fought in Syria.Your comment is dumb
 @Microwave go Mmmm  so what? Does this justify the us? Dumb comment
 @Software Dynamo  Are you slow? He's the one saying that the invasion of Ukraine is justified because of American war mongers.
Lugansk and Donetsk  ....say thank you .
It’s too late now… NATO should have let them in before this started.
that would be sure ww3
I wonder if Hunter Biden is rushing back to his job in the Ukraine.He is a Ukrainian energy expert after all.If anyone can keep the power on, its him, he made millions so he mustbe an energy genious.
All this damage because of 👎usa & 👎england.
Zelenky: I’ve been killing the Russian speaking people in the east for eight years. How can Putin be mad?
We are stuck
Russia are the 
God bless the world 🙏💔🙏
Welcome to the end
I know what will be said by someone invade Taiwan in the future.
Dont believe the news.
Ukranian leadership was more interested in EU and NATO membership and bloc politics. Should have taken russian reservations seriously. Now they have destroyed future of this beautiful country.
putin is crazy
De-Nazification of Ukraine … what does he mean ?!
This war is so conflicting. Russians are saying it’s to stop Ukraine from shooting civilians in donbass and our gov, media, etc is saying this is an act of war What about other wars like Yemen, etc we don’t speak about?
GIVE UKRAINE BACK I HAVE A BABY FOR GODS SAKE. I DIDNT ASK FOR WAR AND I DONT LIVE IN RUSSIA OR UKRAINE SO THE FACT MY LIFE IS ALSO IN DANGER IS PURELY A FAILED GOVERNMENTS FAULT #GIVEUKRAINEBACK
Man
This was inevitable cause Nato has always wanted to destroy russia
The reason they don't want to be liberated is because weirdly enough they already have freedom and their own country which seems pretty liberated to me 🤷‍♂️ why would you want to be liberated when you have your own freedom and the right to dictate your future 🤦‍♂️
STOP ALL THE TALK GO GO GO GIVE THEM HELP IN UKRAINE THESE PEOPLE WILL DIE SEND MORE
Till 1990: NATO had 16 membersrRussia: Don't expand furtherrAmerica: Okay we will not expand (verbally, not written)r1999: Poland, Hungary and Czech republic joined NATOrRussia: But you said you won't expand!rAmerica: Where is the written document, so jack offr2004: Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia joined NATOrRussia: But you said you won't expand!rAmerica: Where is the written document, so jack offr2009: Albania and Croatia joined NATOrRussia: But you said you won't expandrAmerica: Where is the written document, so jack offr2017: Montenegro and North Macedonia joined NATOrRussia: But you said you won't expand!rAmerica: Where is the written document, so jack offr2021: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia and Ukraine will joinrRussia: Enough is enough, you are betraying us ever since 1990s, if we allow you, you will deploy missiles on our borders.rWorld: Russia is so aggressive, they are evil, they don't think about humanity, Russia is expanding. Putin is being unreasonable...... rrHypocrite world!!!!!
And tell me, why does every strong political opponent of Putin in Russia disappear, get ill, die, or be sent to prison? Absolute power corrupts absolutely.
A dacha is ideal for a drone or cruise missile.
it's really easy to stop the war, Ukraine give up joining Nato!!!!! announce the give up, please do it, the president of Ukraine!!!
Hey Putin, check 6, because we’re coming for you! you done fucked up big boy.
Disgusting. Putin should go to the front line, but the old coward wont, he is an old extinct megalomaniac and I hope normal Russians take to the streets. Unbelievable in 2022
If they Deep State in the U.S. know what's good for them they'll stay out of it.
Let the rest of the world fight for Ukraine please. International community use please assist them 🇺🇦
What a sad time to be a human being.
God bless
US must stop expanding eastwards and destroying the innocent countries.It's the presence of US military that is causing this crisis in Ukraine.It's the US that has to be held accountable.
NATO is shit
Regular people will suffer once again
Praying won't stop Putin sadly it will take fighting fire with fire but NATO is spineless
War will not last long. Putin has a very strong army, in good strategic locations and can easily sweep Ukraine's army. What would Joe Biden do? Watch until war is over. Blah blah blah blah.
Screw Putin!
Putin You Russian Nazis    👎👎👎👎👎
Just like NATO air strikes on Baghdad
I get it now, Putin didn't want a war with Ukraine.Putin just wants Ukraine, period.
Ukranian fight for you country
Putin wicked
Just off Putin, now!rWould you have killed Hitler if you had the opportunity.rCruise missiles or drones on a dacha.
Putin always intended to invade, regardless of any assurances the Kiev government might give about NATO. The sole intention was to invade.
Ur asking for WW3. If US and its allies gonna move, Russia's allies will also start lining up.
I mean how is this any different from other centuries
 @Odynith  i mean 2020 to 2022 has all been very bad so i can see what he means
Living in War time
Yea i want to be a dolphin
I actually wish I was a water bear.. floating out in vast space. Those guys are the true alpha species
if only Ukraine, he wants Soviet Union (Emipre)
All I know is that he lies a lot.
But Ukraine doesnt want to belong to Putin, period.
Over 50% of the comments are bots!
How about those Minsk agreements….. oh wait, after stalling them for eight years I guess time ran out
Vladimir Putin has gone mad. Take him out before he starts World War 3.
*PRAY FOR UKRAINE = GOOD SWEET PEOPLE!!!*
The Ukrainian government and army must surrender because the US and NATO will never come to help  Ukrainian people that is the Policy of United States they will say we are coming but in reality they don't........ As a human being my prayers are with Ukrainian 🤲🤲🤲 Love ❤️ Humanity and Peace 🕊️🕊️🕊️
For Mother Russia!!!!!
Where are Ukraine army?????
May the Almighty give dear Ukrainians strength enough to tide over the nefarious design. With best wishes from India.
Putin is the nazi. Europe's Hitler 2.0The world is watching!🇺🇦 Glory to Ukraine 🇺🇦
Praying for Ukraine from UK
You have our condolences, yours sincerely NATO
Imagine if china attacks taiwan now
Absolute power corrupts absolutely.
This is heartbreaking for ukrainian people😂😂
NATO will never come, they are pussy
putin is a murderer
Please Russian people step up to this war you don't want and killing of your Ukrainian brothers and sisters . Time to grow up and show the world you can live without suppresion of a small minority.
if Russia attack the Baltics it probably would start ww3
If youre not willing to fight and die for your country, you wont have a country left. Sad to say, unfortunate.
bombed with missiles, the Ukrainian army can not hold out
Having the edge in modern technology and weaponry means the lesser side has no chance.
Tf u laughing for??
❤️ for Ukrainian people
Feels like 1939
As a indian🇮🇳 I pray to God for blesses people of Ukraine.
If I had a red button, i gonna use for Putin’s location. This evil must be stopped.
It's a fight to the death now. If Russia prevails there will be purges and executions on a horrific scale.
He attack and self defense? Can you lie even more, Satan??? So if someone attack you, then you  watch TV and do nothing?
Pray for Ukraine
Father, please help brothers,and sisters in Ukraine  God Bless love from Missouri.St.louis
starting off with warcrimes great
NATO = No Action Talk Only.
WHERE IS THE NATO?! SACTIONS, GTFO EVERYONE KNOWS IT WON'T DO ANYTHING! WHY DO UKRANIAN LIVES NOT MATTER ENOUGH?
It's China's 🇨🇳 fault. Xi 
2:46 Ukraine Mig-29
Russia face seviour consequences
This most be stop⚠ innocent people may die.
Turn to Jesus Christ his return is near REPENT
Someone just assassinate him please
as with Hitler, diplomacy has failed, we must prepare for war
an*
The Russian megalomaniac has dialog along these lines with one and all...Putin: 
Fake news!They're attaking Putin in order to destroy the Russian commercial influence in Europe...Don't be naive...watch up
Go Mother Russia,,,,,!!!
Hopefully we will open up our North Sea gas reserves, authorise fracking and convert Drax power station back to coal, not imported wood chips and make the UK self sufficient in energy again. The 'Green nonsense' must be put into perspective again and we have to look after our UK citizens first and foremost. Wake up Boris!!
Big love to the ukrainian people from Egypt 🇪🇬 Allah  bless you ❤️🤲🏻
GOOD TIME TO MIGRATErUKRAINE UKRAINE GO GO GO TO USA AND EU.rGO UKRAINE GOrNOW IS THE BEST TIME AND GOOD REASONSrFAILING WHICH YOU MISSED THIS TIMErYOU WILL regret
If you want an example of complete bullcrap, listen to Putin's words.
nato and america have to take responsibility today Russia is forced to fight because of them innocent people have to take responsibility load Europe and America😡
This is all supposed to happen.
I don’t want to take sides in these two countries. All problems can be discussed in a good way. It is just arrogance to show the elegance of violence to others that does nothing good in the life of every person in the world.I pray for their peace of soul to find the light of God again specially the Russia. She forget what she have done before, and the promise to change herself into a good servant of God. What happen to you 
Just need a well nuff skilled sniper to take out Putin...?!
Sending prayers to all ppl who were affected by it. 🇵🇭🇺🇦
very sad
russia is too strong 💪 took down the ukraine forces within an hour
I am the only one that is watching this whole saga unfold like the prelude did to WW2? The documentaries will be similar… but this will be in HD not black and white.
All my heart and support for Ukrainian🥲❤️Stay strong
UKRAINE IS MUCH MORE RUSSIAN AND MUCH LESS EUROPEAN.
The 2 nazi threats, the small groups in Ukraine and the fascist bordering state to the east.
Praying for Russia, hope Ukraine falls fast 🇷🇺
Mother is mad for blood.
Don’t bless them with a fake god
Allah was a rebellious god, so it's fitting to call on him.

From a movie star to trying to protect your country against war. The lord is your strength.

Putin needs to be stopped! He's the villain in the story and the war! No to war! Be safe everyone!
Yes, for humanity. I wonder if NATO and the west could have prevented this. Here is my assessment of what could have prevented a war between Russia and Ukraine that the media is not telling you. Let’s have a debate by commenting on this video, watch this clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dURbVp6gM0

 @FOUZAAN  All hail to our motherland russia
 @Scare Crow  Yeah Definitely ...Long live mother Russia . ❤️🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺 ...
 @FOUZAAN  so... Long live atrocities and extinction.. yeah right
 @The star wars music composer  No .. Long live peacekeepers and humanity . ❤️
 @FOUZAAN  russia is not peacekeeping. Their firing missiles on kiev and innocent people for god sake. Russia is ready to wipe out the entire population of ukraine and poland just for quote 
'Horrifying Moment' Russian Bombs Drop All Over Ukraine https://youtu.be/ApuUWKuTJzw
 @The star wars music composer  Haha ..You know Russians love Ukranian more than we do ! Fight is only against the Neo-Nazis , who are a great threat to Russia .
 @FOUZAAN  are u sure? Than why not just kill the quote. Nazis... Why u killing innocent soidiers and citizens and bombing them
 @The star wars music composer  We are liberating them from evil western
 @Scare Crow  are u sure? Westerns are saying they are liberating ukraine from evil russia. And russia is saying u are liberation ukraine from west. Don't u think ukraine just wants to be alone? And make its own decision. Strange also how i haven't seen america or the rest of innocent european countries like france and germany fire missiles at kiev
 @FOUZAAN  Stay weak Russia, Stay Strong Ukraine
 @Mig S  haha.   😂😂 . Everyone knows who is weak ie. Biden 😂😂😂.Putin is greatest leader in the world as of now ❤️💪💪💪🔥
 @The star wars music composer  You didn't hear the President carefully.He (Putin) said we're conducting a special military operation.. means ..only against the Neo -nazis.Also Ukraine says it has shot down 5 Russian planes . This is war , here people die. 😭😭😭.
 @FOUZAAN  than you need to prove you're not hurting innocents..... Ukrainians and russians are dying. Just stop this war
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
 @The star wars music composer  I'm not in favour of war ... War is definitely not a good thing . At last , We can only trust Russian army . 🇷🇺Very professional. They can't be killing innocents .
 @FOUZAAN  u can trust on your own. Im a thai and worrying for the innocents of ukraine. I know war might not touch my land but we've got to be caring others too
Spoke to someone in Donesk last night. It's no joke, believe me.
It's possible.
Ridicilous.
 @electron wave  What's that mate?
 @NJ  You are saying nothing serious is happening in Ukraine. I was talking to a Donesk resident last night who says it was getting 'hot'.
 @electron wave  Nah mate, everything is fine. It's not the Russians I am afraid of. It's the rebels lol.
Nato is to blame here. They broke the agreement that was in place for years by setting up American bases around the East when they knew rightly they would be stepping on the toes of Putin, forcing his hand.
где же были ваши 
Experience of losing 😂😂😂
I thought the Soviet Union had died in 1991.
 @Polymathic Talk  100% correct!
Ты следущий!
 @Polymathic Talk  Sure lets blame NATO for Putins imperialist claims. We experienced the Innocent Russian peacekeepers in Poland others in Czech Republic, Hungary, Chechnya, Georgia and much more. He is just another imperialist no different than Stalin or Hitler. Shelling the civilians not military targets like he said in the morning. Stay strong Ukraine much love from Poland
 @Polymathic Talk  Russian troll wants to own Ukraine, what a surprise... Ukraine is a free country and can join NATO or EU if that's its wish. Russia should fo.
My great grandparents immigrated to the US before the invasion
 @Dan McAlester  you are wrong. Eastern countries are democracies and have the freedom to choose what organization to join to. They asked to be included in NATO. Putin's mind is locked in the soviet era. Invading Ukrania is a mistake and he will be deposed as Gadafi, Musolini, Sadam by his own people.
 @Aleks Kho  сто раз да! И они это не то что знают, эти мрази ещё вякать смеют что-то.Путин ясно сказал. - надеюсь что услышат.Судя по всему не слышат. Значит будут уничтожены угрожающие нам системы в Румынии,  Польше и Чехии...А смысл останавливаться на окраинских структурах...?Раз пошла такая пьянка...режь последний огурец. Нет баз в Румунии, Польсци, та Неметчины... Нет стартовых позиций ракет.На 
 @Dan McAlester  What agreement?
 @Dan McAlester  Which agreement??Read about the 4+2 agreement which was signed in September 1990.
Peacekeepers with missile. Stewpid putin
 @Ja Pdgpdg440  You forget the evils of NATO? Do you understand the contradiction of NATO for this situation? Just remember Kosovo.
 @Ja Pdgpdg440  They liberated Romania from nazis raping and pilaging everything in their paths. They say why NATO has weapons here in Romania, well we do not want Russia to have any word again on our lifestyle, also they are putting people in jail because they believe in God more then in this stupid dictator. What normal person wants to have this kind of leader? Only stupid ones like Korea and venezuela and the ones who like wars.
 @Aleks Kho  Yeah Russian bot, I blame nato for everything Russian is doing. If Russia conquers the world I will blame nato 😡
 @Vendetta  whatever evil Nato is, Putin had just shown himself to be equally evil. How the heck do you think attacking civilians to prove a point is alright or not evil?
 @Dan McAlester  No Russia is to blame. NATO is there because of actions like this.Go move to Russia commie.
How about attacking Soviet Union in 1941 on Hitlers side and killing soviet civilians, have czech people forgotten this shameful actions? You hypocrites.
 @Dan McAlester  oh shut up!
My youngest was an Elite gymnast (in US). One of her coaches was a Czech Olympian from the 80s- Hana Ricna. She has some horrible stories of the days when Russia was in their country. Another woman, from Romania was a gymnast in those days as well. She also has horror stories. The bus the girls were riding in to take them to a competition was stopped by a Russian (Soviet in those days) military check point. The soldiers boarded the plane with machine guns, yelling and screaming at the girls (all aged 10-17) and emptying out their bags. They demanded ID of them all to make sure they were given 
 @Привет Всем  Im not sure if you aware of this but Stalin also wanted to struck Hitler but he was a bit late. Thats why Red Army lost their airfields so quickly because they were grouped in preparation for an offensive. They were both mad and evil war crimes of Nazi germany wont justify war crimes of Red Army
 @Swirvin' Birds  lol I'm not a commie, I can just see the facts for what they are :L pressure from Nato and America forced Putin's hand. Research it, there's plenty of articles out there on it.
Should have supported us (Russians) against communist usurpers in 1917. Didn’t think that would backfire? Now everyone is suffering.
 @Dan McAlester  You are lying, no such agreement exists. Nato's expansion was well justified because the countries formerly occupied by the Soviet Union knew very well that Russia has not given up on its imperialist aspirations. Putin has become the epitome of these aspirations and stands as the new Hitler of Europe. Ukraine suffers because of that. The new greedy Hitler called Putin wants to conquer its neighboring territories and subjugate other nations. Putin = Hitler
 @Dan McAlester  There was no such agreement on any paper. Stop spreading russian propaganda. USSR is over and Putin can't stand it. Ukraine is an independent state. It's not your backyard.
 @Aleks Kho  Ffs you really think the best way to respond is by killing innocent people too? You want a bloody third world war or something?
 @Dan McAlester  The agreement was with the Soviet Union. Maybe you’re not aware of it but the USSR collapsed and former occupied countries of Latvia,!Estonia, Lithuanian, Poland, East Germany, Austria, Chech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria, ALL joined NATO because they know Russia far better than you do. Stop supporting Putin!!He is doing everything Hitler did before WWII.
 @Dan McAlester  Nobody 
 @Dan McAlester  Putin said Ukraine is Russian, that has nothing to do with NATO
 @Привет Всем  How about Katyn Massacre? Geocine in Chechenya? Killing Putin's political oponents. Never trust a guy who is in power for over 20 years.
 @Aleks Kho  Thanks comrade. Putin is grateful for your support.
 @Dan McAlester  Thank you for your reply. Please comment on my platform so those there can engage in the debate. Also, please consider subscribe to the channel, if you haven't already done so. Here is a reminder of the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dURbVp6gM0
 @Nikki D  I am not defending Putin or his actions. I am merely disagreeing with NATO  sympathizers who are unaware of NATO's crimes against humanity for how many decades now? Both are evil and should not divide people on ''which one is lesser evil'' and support the other, but acknowledge both and act upon it.
 @Привет Всем  How about that Stalin had signed an agreement with Hitler to partition Poland?! We see you as a Putin supporter.
 @Dan McAlester  B.S. dude. Nobody but Russia had any plans for invasion.Yea, there is a lot of Russian disinformation out there.You seem to love Russia... Not sure what else to call you.Putin 'We have no plans for Invading Ukraine
 @Ja Pdgpdg440  don’t give me this shit, you won’t erase your shameful actions against us, we won’t forget that, although you are slavs as we are.
 @Rigoberto Leon  It still forced Putin's hand as it was a threat to have NATO 500 miles from Moscow. That would give First Strike Capability entirely into the hands of Uncle Sam, and would require constant army presence at the Ukrainian border. Cuba voluntarily had Soviet nuclear warheads aimed at the United States, but yet I don't see you criticising the American handling of the Cuban Missile Crisis. Whether or not a country is democratic is irrelevant to grand strategy.
 @Paul Schulte  I have Czech, Polish and Ukrainian friends and most of them blame Nato and Biden for this because the problem has nothing to do with the west... but I do see how if the agreement was with the USSR then obviously it wouldn't hold now so I was wrong in that regard :L
 @Paul Schulte  I am not Putins supporter in any ways, you have to understand and remember the history teachings, you guys have to admit that Hitler attacked the Soviet Union and nit Stalin invaded Europe, you guys killed so many civilians almost 27 mil, what Stalin did, I don’t praise him for those shameful actions he had done, but you can’t blindly defend what you really don’t understand or you don’t want to admit as true. So God be with you.
Well yes NATO is aggressive thats for sure and american high profile politicians have a lot invested in ukraine also in terms of very dark businesses so i can understand Putin is annoyed they are doing this in his face and on his borders. Anyway this is all planned by the usual bankers who started all wars since Napoleon.. Mafia vs Mafia thats what this is. Ukraine PM is also a rotten actor provoking Russia blindly
Lol theres no su h thing as democracy or freedom. Only negotiations and agreements. We are

Putin has been in office too long,  he thinks he is like Emperor Trudeau now, King of Canada !
 @Привет Всем  why u bringing up shit that happened EONS ago to justify something dumbass, Germany also fucked up half the world like 50 years ago, do we gotta invade them to bc they did?
 @Дмитрий Сергеев  bruh putin has no right to say what happens in neighbouring countries, he isn't the president of the ukraine. Fuck putin.
 @Visi Goth  russia will get nuked before they conquer the world, same with China.
 @Dan McAlester  you're a commie
 @Bean Squad  I have more in common with a lamp post than any commie. You by the sounds of things have the mental complexity of a lamp post.
 @Dan McAlester  You cite friends in former Soviet occupied countries, now protected by NATO as blaming NATO?I bet.
 @Paul Schulte  yeah I do? My Ukrainian friend said herself that the problems between Russia and Ukraine need to be delt with by themselves? She doesn't want anyone else to get involved :L neither do any other of my slavic friends...fact, there wouldn't be a war of any description if Biden and Nato didn't put bases in the east where they knew it would cause this reaction.
 @Dan McAlester  Russia is shelling and bombing Ukraine.I hope your friend survives.
@Bad ManI remember my Mum telling me the story of 1968 when I was a child. She never forgot even though she wasn't involved in any way.
 @Rigoberto Leon  Gaddafi was an idiot, Saddam was surrounded by Jews in the guise of Arabs.. Putin is a former KGB agent well educated, and Putin and Russian people have the bitter experience of soviet disintegration which caused them beg on the streets. Arsenal of Saddam and gaddafi would be children's toys against Russian military hardware. Rest assured, history teaches to take a cue from the past.. Soviet disintegration and Saddam and gaddafi related events aren't thousands of years old, they happened recently, people's memory is still refreshed about it.. Post Soviet is shrewd of all people, where everybody has become more cunning not only the westerners.. 😊
My question is what did NATO and Biden Presidency doing in Ukraine? This is all the western countries fault. Whats next? China imposing on Taiwan? Syria? America is loosing her grips now and war is good for Business apparently.
Russia go full Galactic Empire Pan Slavic Imperium world conquest bugaloo
I will gladly work with Russia against the British government!
Whether they are NATO or not if nato  just stands and watch Ukraine get completely slaughtered then NATO is no better than just protection mafia. We shall see the tests of western values and whether it is up to it. Putin is a nutter paranoid schizo like Hitler
😁
Stay strong 🇺🇦
PleasePresident Putinjust walk right into Ukraine & remove the COMEDIAN PRESIDENT !!!ps: get rid of the enemy at your doorstep !!
🙁🙁🙁
I wish my country India🇮🇳 and government,stop being neutral and condemm action of Russia..Its need of an hour for Indian government dial up to russia for reason and stop all this,India being a nonneutral in this matter
Ads ? Really ??
Self defense haha
Putin = Hitler
Russian war protesters were paid, arrested, as a 
Comedy President, Tragedy Country
Stupid Ukrainian politician. Greed and corruption weakens the stability of the nation and as a result, it is very easy to be attack from outside force. Play both sides, you picked the West instead of being independent.
To stop this America should remove the missiles of provocation in Europe.  End of
Rich people in governments start the wars and the poor die for them. Sad but will never change.
Love and prayers to Ukraine
https://youtube.com/shorts/eCgMVNeko9g?feature=share🙂👆
haha, if USA removes all missiles putin will attack more countries, wake up. This is not defense. This is clear agression
White privilege
 @Kane Kochera  what????
 @Kane Kochera  L
If it will never change then I guess there's not really any reason to talk about it or bring it up?
True, someone start the war someone had to end it.
Sadly its not.. This is all Mad old man Putin does.. I'm from Ukraine.. what rich governments are you talking about?
 @Tetiana Zuieva  Putin is Russia’s government wtf are you saying?
 @Ras Claaticus  it's how governments make money, been happening sence before Roman times. It's pritty much on a predictable cycle. It won't change because people being able to be manipulated won't change. Not enough people to put their differences aside long enough to stand together. 🤷
 @Jacob Cressman  wtf? Watch your language firstly, I know what I'm saying coz I'm in Ukraine. I commented words above coz this lady said war made by rich goverments and the only person who  came with war is PUTIN
 @Kane Kochera  *Humankind privilege. Stop playing the used up race card, everyone's a monster to the earth lmao
100% Right.
Much love to Russia 🇷🇺
The Russian military action in Eastern parts of the Ukraine was always going to be characterised as ‘Russian aggression’ by the Western media. However, what the Western media omits is the fact that NATO have been expanding eastward towards Russia’s borders since the end of the Cold War – this is despite verbal agreements that NATO would not engage in such actions. NATO is now nothing more than an instrument of American interventionism and when viewing this situation from both sides, Russia’s demands that NATO ceases their military expansion in Eastern Europe and does not place its forces ever closer to Russia’s borders, is, to say the least, very reasonable and understandable.
What a time to live in
How did the tanks end up in Ukraines 2nd largest city ? Aren’t they defending there borders ?
? America doing now😡....or waiting for guns sells
Please stop this inhumane  activity 😢
Civilians are off limits. Russia is one of the nations that helped to create that treaty.Putin has proven to be as greedy and underhanded as the royals that took the nation into WWI. This has got to end FAST.
During ww2 The Germans Civilians  stayed in the subway tunnels The Russians and or amaricans. Bombed and leveled the cityNo one survivedDays later they found the tunnels Heat hot to every one they were stuck  due to fires above May god be with the strong people of Ukrainian Give them hell The world is watching  and we are with you Ukraine
Please Save humanity and save Ukraine🙏🙏🙏🙏Otherwise no difference between a Muslim or America..... Because only America and NATO is responsible for Ukraine crisis #boycott_america
praying that God sends peace all over ☮️ 🙏
We need too bomb CANADA now show that dictator what democracy looks like . Taught Saddam Hussein a lesson .😊
He lied
like they are going to surrender it can only get worse
E tem retardado de direita dizendo que Putin é um conservador. Nao tem lado certo EUA, EU, abutres de toda forma
They got money for the war and can't feed the poor.. why is the Biden administration silent ,, Trump would've done better..
I'm from Russia but a really don't want a war with Ukraine. All Russian people don't want it. We all disagree with Putin's decision, I don't understand why is he doing that, I don't want to fight for nothing. I hope it will end soon...
Out putin
Russia is doing as like as Israel
Sadly EU countries are too pathetic for not helping Ukrain. Why do we even have the Nato if noone in Europe is willing to help them? Soldiers from Belarus have been seen helping Russia...smh
Rather than get into an endless debate, tell me this...Why does every strong political opponent of Putin in Russia get ill, mysteriously disappear, die, or sent to prison for a decade? Hmmm?
Horrible
Endtimes it seems in Case Biden sends soldiers…
Afghanistan army story all over part two.
This been happening for a while now the west even warned them that Putin is gathering his army
It's a war between presidents, but not people 😓
Brother killing brother; who would support that? But Putin has 'done away' with political opponents.
 @electron wave  Yes, many of Russians have a relatives in the Ukraine, it's nonsense to fight like that
 @John Quest  I remember on television when Russian annexed Crimea in 2014. There were ten Russian soldiers facing Ukraine soldiers, only 10 meters apart. One Ukraine solder was pleading, 
Ukraine 💔🇺🇦
Russia not affried to all nation..
An airport??? Damn
The sound of explosions and the alarms give me goosebumps
Russia is kind like Canada if u think about it
President Putin is a real demon and a real murderer free the people of Ukraine 🙏 we don't need war we need unity
🇨🇿♥️🇺🇦
This nothing but a charade!!!
Total war is the only acceptable answer
I would have fled to the forests if this happened
Praying 🙏🙏🙏🙏
So what will the US 🇺🇸 AND THE SOVIETS DO😏😏😏🤧🤧...
Putin just doing some weapon test 😎
I will say this again Ukraine vs Russia is just like the star wars clone wars. where in the leaders are the separatist and their soldiers are the stormtroopers. The America and European Union are like palpatine manipulating and controling this war for their own benefit and power. We People can be the Jedi Knight by uniting and stopping this war, sending messages to America to stop provoking too much. The America is taking advantage of the situation by selling weapons and security, now they have reason to Print More Money💰, oil prices is getting high, gold prices is getting high, elites are profiting from the conflicts.
“Denazification?”I thought it was “Decommunization” last week.This guys more demented than Biden
Fuck this damn politicians and their games
The Ukrainian president has voluntarily acted as a pawn of the United States without any benefit, repeatedly provoking to join NATO. More than a dozen countries around Russia have joined NATO. And NATO gave Russia the assurance that it would not expand 30 years ago. So the Ukrainian president is the one who escalated the situation, he did it on purpose. When Russia was about to withdraw, Ukraine ordered fire, a fact that no one can dispute. Now the whole world is condemning Russia, but how many reasonable people see the truth behind this?
Stay strong Ukraine! From India
We stand with Ukraine, the world will never forget your bravery, wish we could do more than praying for you..
He says he had no such plans. Is that what our country will say too when it all turns to w111
Be careful, because some of this are media staging to give you that effect. Here is my assessment of what could have prevented a war between Russia and Ukraine that the media is not telling you. Let’s have a debate by commenting on this video, watch this clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dURbVp6gM0
Don’t you mean shivers, you weirdo
Югославию поддерживал, лицемер вонючий?Афганистан? Ирак? Закрой пасть!
go fight there not just text  on youtube !
The west does have the option to do considerably more than they currently are, they just need the guts to do it
 @Deni St  cost money to get there who’s financing this?
 @J M  you
 @Перегон Авто  These are fake accounts from india
 @Bob  you can
How about recognize the indeoendence of said territories that want to be independent and end this peacefully instead of threatening them? Ukraine is also to blame for this.
Ukraine is Western fault
 @Перегон Авто  its 2022 woke up !!
Go and fight instead of praying to an imaginary being.
 @Guy Who Likes Breathing  Putin warned today that if anyone interfere in the situtation in the ukraine and create threats to the country and its people will suffer consequences they didnt face in the history and that means one,he will use nuclears,now tell me would u have guts and try to do something ?
 @Deni St  So Russia can just annex Ukraine, and in 2023 say 
Don’t stand with Ukraine at your hone. Go to Ukraine and stand with them on the front line.!
Lobby your politicians to support UN military intervention, such as a no-fly zone over western Ukraine.
You prepay for Hallalala only
Ukraine doesn't care about muslims
yeas
 @Перегон Авто  От этой дерьмовой логики у меня болит мозг, ты говоришь это только для того, чтобы заставить оппозицию замолчать. Дело не в Югославии, не в Афганистане, не в Ираке, а в Украине. Как житель Запада, у меня гораздо более тесные связи с украинцами, чем с любым из этих мест (учитывая, что Югославии больше не существует). Поэтому я оставляю за собой право относиться к ним с большей симпатией.
 @Aleks Kho  This only leads to death , for innocent people form both sides !! Russia will not won this war , humas are dying do you understand ??
 @Перегон Авто  ruskie mad
'Horrifying Moment' Russian Bombs Drop All Over Ukraine https://youtu.be/ApuUWKuTJzw
 @zola Zaza  that’s a bullies bluff. Mutual assured destruction. What a brilliant strategy. Putin is a backwards moron in a backwards dungeon of a country. Russians would do well to get rid of him and actually try and join the civilized world.
 @The Be Sharp  no thnx, i dont want to fight Russia over a shithole called Ukraine.
Well, it's a war between Russia and the USA , Ukraine is only a battleground.
 @Перегон Авто  russia decided to fight the Afghans also. What you on about?
 @Перегон Авто  Один из членов моей семьи также застрял в Украине. Я чувствую себя в ужасе, что с ними что-то случится
Prayers do not do anything except for the believers.
 @Перегон Авто  if switzerland could stay out of nato during cold War, why couldn't ukraine do the same? It was that simple.
 @Deni St  Not his country.
what bravery? u mean bombing russia first? allowing biden to start a new war? yeah what bravery. ukraine pres bluffed thought he would be protected. now russia will walk over and take ukraine rightly so. maybe start reading up on what ukreine hasdone last few months. and what usa has been doing since biden took over. usa and ukraine started this. not russia.
 @Перегон Авто  Couldn't agree more. Nevertheless, now we will all face the horrors of war...
WOOHAA Azov Battalion !
The guy who said 
 @𓁈kymani𓁈  Said the Rastafarian lover.
 @zola Zaza  If the west does nothing about russia savagely annexing neigbouring countries it will just continue on and on
Shutup with with I stand with Russia!!
ahaha first help your country and your 
 @Перегон Авто  😂😂 I believe Afghanistan flew a plain at us 😂😂 so they started it but the other countries your right...but what is the cause of war y'all just want the land?
 @RedoranGuard's-SkyrimBattles 2.2  And Muslims don’t give a damn about your comment. We support Ukraine against the terrorist Putin. Most Russians are against the war.
 @Guy Who Likes Breathing  Not really, if we go all out war. Nuclear will be flying.
 @P  Where did you learn English? Let me guess. In Russia.
 @Lucky Luke  😂 so send American folks over so that Russia can start with us and kill more people glad u not the president rather have Obama back 🤣🤣
Yeah you stand.. from warmed up room and Pc , standing behind the screen and keyboard..
Oh, those antisemitic Nazis?
 @Deni St  Revelations 20 7-9.  Gog and Magog.  Russia and Ukraine.  THE END IS NEAR! WARNING ⚠️ THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST IS NEAR! FEAR THE DEAD CHRIST IS COMING AGAIN! https://youtu.be/yxlxyHI78yE

 @ Jolly Cossack  Revelations 20 7-9!!!!! ARMAGEDDON IS COMING!
 @Wolfskull Wardagger  Для тебя эти люди в Югославии,Ираке другого сорта? Украинцев тебе жалко,а сербов нет? Это и есть нацизм с твоей стороны. Заткнись,Россия не убивает мирных жителей,как это делали украинские военные в Луганске и Донецке. Украинская армия убила более 10 000 мирных жителей Донбасса. За все военные преступления украинских карателей будет расплата.
 @Platinum  they are rurrsian ocupied territoryes the population canoot freely express they will ...
 @Дед Мазай  красавчик
Stop talking just go there like me
 @Devil may cry  Indians are confused right now should they stand with there old daddy or line up with New Daddy
My opinion Russia has right to stop Nato near country’s, but Ukraine is stupid Russia is a very powerful nation, you can’t stop by your own. and NATO will do nothing for you . So be carefully  advice from somalia
 @Rainbow shadow  lol Indeed!!!
 @John Damon Walls  Except Putin isn't a bully; he's a full blown lunatic who has done awful things to get where he is today, like murdering political opponents for decades, among MANY other things. This was the straw that broke the camel's back and he knows there's no going back. What do you think will happen when just as Russia is about to lose, when Putin wakes up and smells the roses, realizing that he's going to lose his position and everything he thinks he's accomplished? MAD isn't the Chekov's Gun you think it is in this situation.
don't talk only bro, go to the front and taste the part of russian shell or ballistics
 @ Jolly Cossack  Don't go spreading dumb shit like that. This was something Putin has been planning for a long time.
 @Mr. seasalteee  Correct!!  Bush and Gorbachev made an agreement ,Russia withdraws it's forces from Eastern Europe and NATO in it's turn would not move an inch to the East.  Russia withdrew their forces and NATO expanded to the East.  Russia been tricked in a most vulgar fashion so Russia  has a right to reclaim the lost territories, in fact Russia has a lots of rights right now.
 @P  Name one western nation that has ever tried to wage war with another western nation in modern history
You don’t know what your talking about
 @Konata Izumi  Then you simply stop the illegal russian assault on ukraine while avoiding nuclear war, all nations that are in possession of nuclear weapons know that if as much of a single nuclear weapon is launched it will create a domino effect of retaliations that will ruin both nations and will bring countless casualties all over the world, I doubt any of them are foolish enough to send over that first nuke.
 @Перегон Авто  if you don't like the West, why are you on western social media.
 @zola Zaza  if putin uses nukes, then everyone else nukes russia out of existence aswell tho.
 @Bean Squad  And where is point in that there wont be any winners
 @zola Zaza  ah yes you said it. It will trigger world war cause Putin planned it well knowing the circumstances between other countries.
 @John Damon Walls 
 @Shanur Rahman  Finally somebody with a brain, thank God.
 @zola Zaza  my point exactly.
 @Дед Мазай  Называть оппонента нацистом — значит объявлять поражение в интернет-дискуссии. То, что я делаю, — это не нацизм, это просто очень человеческое и естественное чувство благосклонности к тем, кто больше похож на вас. А с чего вы взяли, что Россия не будет убивать мирных жителей? Россия хорошо известна как жестокая страна, и снайперы, расстрелявшие украинцев во время протестов Евромайдана, скорее всего, были поддержаны Россией или симпатизирующим России режимом Виктора Януковича. Я также хотел бы знать, откуда у вас информация о гражданах, убитых украинским правительством.
 @Platinum  russian bot
 @Перегон Авто  this is your toughts when kids die because of putin?
 @Wolfskull Wardagger  Почему снайперы стреляли как  по полиции,так и по протестующим? Как так получилось,что 
 @Mark Casila  is that what they tell you jn the US? my god... you are even more brainwashed than i thought.
Z world. :D TV War....distractions from 5th session of the Grand Jury Proceedings.
 @Guy Who Likes Breathing  Oh wow, you're so smart. Why aren't you in the Pentagon?Genius.
You can donate to various charities helping provide medical aid and supplies to both ukranian civilians and military. If you google ‘help ukraine’ articles come up with information for charities
 @Konata Izumi  Ikr
 @Deni St  And what the fuck are you doing?😂
 @𓁈kymani𓁈  And what the fuck are you doing?
Russian Putin go out world 🌎
Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely
NATO are a bunch of hypocrites, this is exactly what they have been doing in the middle East for decades.
Could be old images clips photoshopped ha Bhai news wale
They claimed. They fight with Russia 8 years.  And now 8 hours and Ukraine army boy exist any more 🤷‍♂️
Western hypocrisy brought Ukraine into this war just to verify how strong russian army is & their weapons.. 😡
#Worldwide #Humanitarian Killer's #Israelis #UN #NATO....  #Palestine #GazaAttack, #Syria, #Yemen #Iraq #Afghanistan and #Ukraine
So, What do #USA, the #EU, and #NATO do to help #Ukraine and its indefense people???  Come on #USA, come on #EU, come on #NATO don't be a merely CLOWN to the world and, mainly, a pure CLOWN to #VladimirPutin and #Rusia!!!  It's time to be energic. to put #Russia out of the #SWIFT and #💲, besides to destroy the russian agression over #Ukraine.
How will Poland be involved in all this?
Msia will face rising prices of goods, especially crude oil & petrol due to the Slavic-Russo-Ukrainian War.Russia has long attacked Ukraine (the same tactic in Georgia), plus a month -long emergency. Regardless, I don't feel that way. But, that is all for the justice of MH17 & weakening american influence even though the issue of Muslims in Crimea is still disputed. Try to remember that if the US attacks Afghanistan, it will always see the signs of the end -time war. Ukraine & Georgia want to join NATO, but Russia does not want this to happen because security is threatened. What will the Islamic country do if we want to support good things for the Muslim community. Just like what happened in Iran & Afg'stan etc.(Krisis / Russia-Ukraine Crisis)Although 🇷🇺 & Prez. Putin was severely criticized for the State ☪️, but he still loved ☪️ for defending the Prophet Muhammad SAW. It feels like 🇺🇦 & Crimea should also learn a little about 🇵🇸, Uyghur etc. Article Slavic War (🇷🇺-🇺🇦), a little difficult because the views of Muslims are different.When I look at the news (🗞️📰📺) & the internet (🌐🖥️📶), it's full of baseless propaganda, let alone Islamophobia. Guess this is the reason why I consider the Islamic State to support Russia for reasons of Diplomacy, Dialogue (Calling on both countries to refrain), Military & Economic Support, as well as the Muslim community. If you think back 🇲🇾, 🇮🇷, 🇵🇰, 🇦🇫, 🇹🇷, 🇵🇸, 🇶🇦, 🇧🇦, 🇰🇿 etc. have the same view on the issue.
This is so sad Ukraine 🇺🇦 😢 prayers to you worried about the young kids
Russian missile my ass.. false flag!!!!!
I am from Russia! People in Britain you are misinformed! Kiev has been bombarding Lugansk and Donetsk for 8 years!Children died there for 8 years.That was to be stopped! Any diplomatic negotiations failed!
80 plus years ago Hitler invades Poland his neighbour, today Putin invades Ukraine his neighbour..Two men the world could have done well without.
Ukraine if u guys need an extra fighter I will  fight along side you guys!!!!!
Stop killing of human
NATO (Not Action Talk Only) Ukrainian people are calling for help to NATO and the US..But it's all just nonsense..Supposedly the NATO army deployed its military force into Ukraine
No this is not necessary this was all done by one person. God bless  protect the people of Ukraine.
I suspect it is the other way around; Russia is willingly testing its weaponry on innocent subjects.
Well Ukraine can attack Poland then according to the regulation, NATO will be forced to attack Ukraine then therefore join the war.
 @yiming li  Dear God.
I wonder if you said the same prayers when Iraq was attacked. Of course no citizen must be armed. Here is my assessment of what could have prevented a war between Russia and Ukraine that the media is not telling you. Let’s have a debate by commenting on this video, watch this clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dURbVp6gM0
The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures;he leadeth me beside the still waters.  He restoreth my soul; he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name’s sake.  Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies; thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.  Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life; and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.”  ~ 🙏
 @Polymathic Talk  I guess your family roof is not being bombed by Russia now otherwise you would not be talking like that wise boy.
Too bad NATO cared more about weapons sales instead of peace. I wonder if Biden offered to cut Putin in on the deals and Putin said no.
And you are sure they are not lying to you ,hmm
Putin is going on a rope soon.   You dummy trees are gonna get snapped
 @Nikdo Známej  A lot of people from Donbass are living now in Russia. They were forced to live their homes and flee! Just ask any of them how they have been living in Donbass for the last 8 years! People in Britain,you dont know the first thing about the situation! You are just misinformed! Russian people are for peace in the world!
 @Dmitry Vasiliev  I've spoken to Ukraines in the eastern regions for some years. But, rather than debate issues that have TWO sides, let me ask...why does every strong opponent of Putin in Russia mysteriously disappear, be poisoned, die, or sent to prison for a decade? Hmmm?
 @electron wave  What did people tell you???They lived in terror and dispair for 8 years. I dont agree with everything our government does, but now I do agree.If you dont know people from the west of Ukraine have always hated people from the eastern part and anything connected with Russians!As for piosons and such things,there are people who betray their country, sell information to other countries for money or have a very big mouth! They are just punished for that!I am for peace. I like people from Britain, I like their culture,humour!But they often think that we are an evil nation and bears walk on the streets!People,let's be friends!
 @Dmitry Vasiliev  But my friend, brutality can never solve anything. It is brother against brother!I think Germany is the best example ... many evil people in WWII and now one of the leading nations of the world. Putin is trying to revert to the old USSR.
 @Dmitry Vasiliev  im not from UK. Russian people just want to rule everyone else. My country has suffered enough of your tyrany, we hate you, for your arogance, agression and imperialism. And your state run media is the one who is brainwashing you with lies and propaganda
From the news of Russia's attack, I feel that language has a big role in this, these English people, these Urdu people were weeping on the head of the world, Urdu hair has become open to the English people.रूस के हमले की ख़बर से मुझे तो ये लगता है कि इसमें भाषा का बहुत बड़ा रोल है ये अंग्रेज़ी वाले ये उर्दू वाले दुनिया के सर पर मूत रहे थे उर्दू बालों की तो क़लई खुल गई अंग्रेज़ी वालों की खुलना बाक़ी है👀roos ke hamale kee khabar se mujhe to ye lagata hai ki isamen bhaasha ka bahut bada rol hai ye angrezee vaale ye urdoo vaale duniya ke sar par moot rahe the urdoo baalon kee to qalee khul gaee angrezee vaalon kee khulana baaqee hai👀روس کے حملے کی خبر سے مجھے لگتا ہے کہ اس میں زبان کا بڑا کردار ہے، یہ انگریز، یہ اردو والے دنیا کے سر پر رو رہے تھے، انگریزوں کے لیے اردو کے بال کھلے ہیں۔
If Russian civilians are really against this, I hope they do something about it.
It's like  the equivalent of Spain attacking Portugal. So ridiculous. Poor poor poor civilians
This is why no one ever love or like Russian as their goal is always the invasion to rebuild their soviet territory
1.truckers protest in USA 2.China is ready for a reunification of greater China 😍3.Russia is about to enter Ukraine and far west it needs to be to neutralize NATO weapons.4.1M covid death in so called advanced medical science country 😂Meanwhile in the corner😂,.....Israel : papa (😡😡)!!

We need to cutoff the head of the snake
Was hängt sich denn der Nato Kriegs Treiber Verein in Russland rein???? Ukraine ist nicht in der Nato 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
all wars are bankers wars rthe west and the banking cartels need war to not only make huge profits, its also a great way to hide the financial mess and crimes ,rbut the people never learn from history, and see through the crimes rrthe crash of 1908 - 1914  - WW1 rthe crash of 1929 - 1939 - WW2 rthe Crash of 2008  -             WW3 rralways ready for war to hide their banking crimes and their puppet western leaders whom are own lock stock and barrel by the central banking cartel, will follow their owners or the country will have its loans called in rrhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26O-2SVcrw0
Thoughts and prayers for all in Ukraine 🥰🥰
The only nazi here is the war monger Putin himself. May the Russian people rise against him as their forebears did against Imperial Russia.
нацисты фашисты. позор россии. Putin  fascist
Same On you Russia
Yes, it is very heroic, and these ordinary people will die for their country. However, is it worth it?The war is the consequence of a series of bad decisions taken at the top by the Ukrainian elite.What did you think would happen when you start accepting weapons from the west? Just look at Israel and the surrounding states. Have you been on the same planet?It was predictable from a mile away; even a 12 year old could have predicted that this is what will happen.
God be with both Ukraine and Russian people as we know this is a “ made up war” from the Kabal/Elites... specifically the ones in US as they are trying to contrarest what’s coming to thrm.. PRISON PRISON PRISON for all they have cause the world/America.. PRISON/ GITMO.
why isn't it surgical? what does russia have to gain by attacking civilians?
Ukraine isn't a Democracy, it's an Autocracy - Russia couldn't allow NATO to park up on it's door step - As much as I feel for the Ukrainian people, this was inevitable and created by the West yet again. Btw I have no love for Communists or Putin the Dictator, but like hell do I trust the BBC. or that moron Biden.
Putin will launch a nuclear strike.Western countries! It's new Hitler.You are terribly cowardly people,both Europeans and Americans.You are despised.Kyiv.
Same
We are against it, but probably can do nothing
As a russian civilian I don't support it at all, but I see crlearly it's too late to do sonething about it. I hope I am wrong, but I guess even if we will go on the streets against this war, the process of demilitarisation in Ucraine will take about a month
No we are not
 @Allister  because you're ok with your parents, siblings, children being killed
They can't without being arrested and probably killed themselves
good portion support it
 @Eli Le scholten  20-25%, not more than that, but hardly anyone wants to see deaths of innocents. And i wonder why Putin is so dense, is he not man enough?
 @ControlBox1  If this is a full scale invasion, it will take years, not a month. Ukraine has 40 million people. The insurgency will be 10x larger and better equipped than the one in Afghanistan, which directly played a role in the fall of the USSR. Putin is truly foolish if he thinks this will be easy. It will be a bloody, brutal, and long conflict.If he really just wants to 
Not all of them are against it
 @Organic Farm  because I'm only real Russian here , others are ukrainian fakes. And because I love my country and wish my people best.
Only later, when it is too late, the citizens of Russia will say to themselves: 
Russians love Putin. They will forgive him.
 @Hooyahfish  God bless Russia and Putin
 @Allister  if anything, Ukrainians will spread hate against Russians, why would they pursuade others that Common Russians don't want war? Don't you have any logic?
As a Russian citizen,  I dont agree but I understand why Putin is doing this.   The USA did triggered all this situation in the first place
 @RJ P  how?
Like what?  Riot?  Russian police won't be nice and just stand there with shields for the rioters.
Brother's fighting brother's for the ego of Pussolini..
Well, they'll be imprisoned. Try to get in their shoes.
 @Organic Farm  каждый получает то, что заслуживает. Украина больше никогда не станет самостоятельной страной.
 @Hooyahfish  The last Putin conference I saw, those in attendance looked petrified of the megalomaniac.
 @Allister  You sure you love your people? If you really did you'd hate all war. But no you too like the rest of us are greedy parasites that just love to demolish this planets eco systems
Russian civilians can't do anything because if they protest they get arrested & taken away. You see it in this video. In Russia, many opposition leaders are murdered, or imprisoned on fake charges &/or WMD used on them
 @electron wave  yeah. I saw that too. That’s communism for ya.
There’s literally nothing they can do, are you dumb?
 @UK man loves goddesses   true. and they also forces our official reporters to post news only in government sites, so they can control the propoganda. Other sites which is not controlled by them will be blocked if they say something wrong.
Excellent summary of the state of affairs!
In modern warfare, having the technological advantage and having a weaponry advantage is overwhelming.
Hopefully they protest
In warfare, the general idea is to impose such a horrific cost to the opponents that they lose the will to resist. Evil on Earth.
😔🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
Who wants to die? Ridiculous
Putin did say he wasn't going to attack...until Ukraine started talking shit again about going nuclear.
Where is NATO ??? I thought they will come for backup😐
I support Russia 🇷🇺
if Russia shit on international law they where taught by USA, Britain who invaded Irak without any international legality  and under false evidences, even Ukraine was in the coalition the result was 1/2 million deaths and followed by the foundation of Islamic state
That Russian leader needs a slap
Why so many ads 😠
Please bomb Philippines..many corrupt and many judgemental,lier, people in their..
Putin will pay for this.
Any member of congress who supports putin should be removed from office
Malaysia, UK pray for Ukraine
Such beautiful architecture there!
Why they don’t support it ?Most idiotic question
Many regime changes in Russian history have resulted from inept leaders pulling their population into unpopular wars:In 1917 it was the Tsars involvement in WW1In the 1980s it was Russia's failed war in AfghanistanLet's hope this unpopular war in Ukraine is finally what brings Putin down
Is really horrible, is  crazy and senseless . Why innocent people are suffering due to senseless war ?
victory to Ukraine down with Russia
russian stop terrorism
Prayer is cute but looks like it's a bit late for that. I hope that they are getting to safety. I can't believe Putin is so heartless and evil.
This is a great time to get started as the portfolio has been constructed to benefit from there open trade (also known as cyclical trade) which will be the next big move to take place in the markets. BTC, ETH and others, so i research a bit of 
Putin will pay dearly for this. To the people of Ukraine from America i am praying for you
Deception.

Brother killing brother. Shame!

Nope

 @Em Br  you just love your Topless Totalitarian don't you sweetheart?
ONLY IN HOLLYWOOD USA CAN DEFEAT RUSSIA🤣🤣🤣
Victory for humanity, down with NATO and the west aggression. Here is my assessment of what could have prevented a war between Russia and Ukraine that the media is not telling you. Let’s have a debate by commenting on this video, watch this clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dURbVp6gM0
 @romulo  your country is the shitty hole
Vive la Ukraine
 @romulo  my libya is better than cave you live in . endless gas and oil with only 6 million people in one of Africa biggest countries
 @Em Br  We will let Russia win, because it will create the perfect place for a new insurgency to be born. Putin has made the mistake we've been waiting for. Welcome to the next 20 years Russia, we're going to run your economy into the ground. One IED at a time.
​ @عاشق التأمل  im from Russia and i hate morocco because your people beheaded two Norwegian girls
 @romulo  no more gaddafi gone forever and he was one of putin allies what a shame and  no russian business will set foot in libya forever . we will deal with Ukraine business
 @Em Br  Russians gonna suffer with bodybags
 @romulo  you can not say where are you from because you are ashamed of your country . disgraceful bot
 @Hell Cat  do not come to north africa . No russian will be alive in north africa after Ukraine invasion . you will pay heavy price for this also for syria and your mercenaries in libya
 @Hell Cat  evil race of people with evil dictator . vodka make you like animal
Down with Russia the biggest terrorist state under putin
 @عاشق التأمل  I'm from the uk and I hate my own country including yours
 @Libya ليبيا  That's your choice as it's my own to hate you also
Down with Russia the biggest terrorist state under putin
 @MATTHEW GIBBS  the ones who started this is Putin you stinking bot GTF
 @Hell Cat  The incident of the Russian girls, it is true that it happened, but all the Moroccan people sympathized with them and condemned this crime, which unfortunately happened.  It is a crime that occurs in all countries.  As for you, you are a criminal state and the presidents, you are a criminal people.  Did you see what Stalin did to Russian society?  He killed fifty million people
 @Libya ليبيا  idiot usa destroyed lybia you are happy from italy,russia win again this war against nato
 @Timothy jacob Calinao  but Russians who protest are being arrested. People in Russia must come together to stop this madness
 @null  or what?
 @anna salomoni  Italy is against putin like all decent sane people
 @anna salomoni  its called libya moron and destroyed gaddafi  also russian mercenaries are in libya but you would not dare to mention them
 @anna salomoni  yes im happy mrs pizza and your country italy wiped out half of the libyan population during mussolini fascist rule . i guess that's why you love Putin .
 @Vakhiz  the military spendings are more than 15 times larger in the USA than in Russia. USA can destroy tanks without even using a single soldier. Please don’t play with the US for your own safety.
 @Reaver  You shouldn't be hating countries, more so the human race for being so disgustingly greedy and destructive. Lmao no one's the hero ever, and earth is always the one taking the beating
libya in shambles  making money auctioning africans to eat..shit hole country  one of the most corrupt in the world
 @Timothy jacob Calinao  then those Russians need to rise up. They are as much under the Jack boot of this lunatic as Ukraine are
 @Echo Bay  no we want peace talks and russia is not enemy i n my opinion enemy is europe and nato.ok
 @anna salomoni  Russia is 100% the enemy. You have a state that can't even give its country free elections. People who express their opinions are arrested and disappear. It is a totally corrupt state. It's run by a man who wants to take over other free independent nations because he can't stand freedom. He's a coward and afraid and a bully and you are a coward just like him. This issue is the work of Putin and his cronies. Long live freedom long live democracy and God bless Ukraine
 @Polymathic Talk  regardless of what you say the Russian state and putin are murderous criminals and have been murdering people for 20 years especially in Syria. You ought to feel ashamed of yourself because with views like yours your something I wouldn't even step on
 @Echo Bay  NO ABSOLOUTLY I DON'T THINK RUSSIA IS ENEMY ITALY HAS PETROLEUM AND ENERGY FROM RUSSIA NOW ITALY IS DESTROYED ECONOMIC COLAPSE,IF THIS IS NOT A TRAGEDY TIME,BUT I THINK THE ONLY WAY IS PEACE TALKS USA AND RUSSIA.BYE
 @anna salomoni  RUSSIA is 100% the enemy. Run away like a coward like your fellow cowards will run in the end! Long live Ukraine!
 @Echo Bay  AH AHA HA AND USA NATO IN IRAQ AND VIETNAM OR IN YUGOSLAVIA,HIROSHIMA OR NAGASAKI OR LYBIA OR IN AFRICA,UKRAINE LOSE,EUROPE LOSE FOREVER IS DANGEROUS FOR US EUROPE AND VON DER LEYERN ,,I THINK UKRAINE AND ZELENKY MAKE A GREAT MISTAKE ITALY IS UNDER NATO AND NUCLEAR ARSENALS IS HERE IF ITALY BATTLE AGAINST RUSSIA,MISSILES DESTROY ROME AND  ITALY,YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND NOW WE MAKE PEACE TALKING THIS IS NOT WW3,WW3 START IN MIDDLE EAST AGAINST ISRAEL ,ARMAGGEDDON IS NEAR THE PEACE PROCESS IS USA AND RUSSIA ,NOSTRADAMUS SAY THE ENEMIES BECAME TWO FRIENDS TO ESTABLISH PEACE PROCESS IN THE WORD DURING ARMAGGEDDON NEAR STREET OF BERING ALASKA!!!!!!!!
 @anna salomoni  If you think that the nation states on this earth are going to bow down to Putin you are mistaken. The US and Nato have a greater military arsenal than Russia. No one wins in a nuclear war but if the intention is to enslave other countries then nuclear war is inevitable because the world will not stand for it. Zelensky made the right decision. Now crawl back into that hole in the ground you came from.
SHUT UP BOT
Scammers above
No
Looks like Biden’s sanctions are working perfectly
Fuck russia.... stay strong ukraine
praying 🙏 for this 2 County....let there be peace on 🌎 earth....especially for the children and older people ❤🙏😔
There is no purgatory for war criminals ,  Putin and his accomplices  are going straight to Hell 😈👿😈 May God Bless and Protect Ukraine
It's not a bad idea for Kiev to experience the same thing as the people of Donetsk (have experienced for 8 years) if only for a couple of days!
One minute silence for those innocent Iraqis, Afghans, Syrians who have lost their lives in the unjust and barbaric attacks of NATO and European armies.Putin is still very mild according to NATO's invasion. Still didn't attack on the civilians...

Putin is sick. He needs to be taken out by one of his own people.He knows that the intel the Americans had came from his own inner circle.Why do you think he scolded his intel minister as if he was a child.He is angry and paranoid and will only stop when he is dead.The Russian people must stand up against this ratface scumbag and show him short thrift.He belongs in the toilet of history.
I stand with RussiaRest in peace humanity
Save Ukraine
where is Ukraine army and forces , no one will fight for them they have to fight to save country , US/ NATA will only support logistically and empty bottle talk , Come on Ukraine fight .. get up
UKRAINS FAULT
This is Video's #Palestine #GazaAttack
Wtf is Putin doing in today's world and what the hell is USA doing being friends and doing nothing for Ukrainian people I feel so sorry for Ukranian people and Joe Biden has fooled UkraineEdit : NATO and other allias are doing nothing but pushing Ukraine into a hole
Pray for Ukraine 🇺🇦
We want peace in nations, we want peace between nations, and we want peace in the world, we want peace between the worlds too! May God change the hearts of men into love and peace.
Self defense right ?How many missiles has Ukraine  dropped in Moscow ?Shame on you Putin .God bless Ukraine 🙏🇺🇦🇺🇦
Efn coward Putin is hiding in a bunker right now!
Putin want to calm down
Putin Stop war
This is actual Hell unfortunately
Good grief. Next you be dancing on the graves.
 @electron wave  if only you had spent a couple of weeks in Donetsk, my friend, in the last couple of years!
There are civilian deaths
Завались нахрен, кремлебот. Сунниты которые готовили смертников, а потом заставляли детей с калашами стрелять в военных которые пришли утихомирить радикалов - ни разу не гражданские.
US and U.K. forces attached these countries as they were harbouring terrorists liked to ISIS and Al-Qaida, what terrorists organisation are their in Ukraine absolutely none and when has Ukraine ever attached Russian buildings or military installations This has all started because Ukraine wanted to join NATO and Russia’s turned around and said they could not with absolutely no authority to do so.The trouble is now he has entered the country he will stop at noting until Russia has taken over the whole of Ukraine and declared it Russian territory Countries on the west of Ukraine should be very worried as it may not even stop their and they could be next.
One minute silence for those millions of iranis and kurds Saddam killed 1980-1989 and 3 millions Bagladesh who Pakistan killed 1971.
Dumb comment
Why do you stand with Russia!??
 @甘崇譽  I'd like to know that as well 🤔
Stupidly is in your family blood.
It just wants attention
That's because you have a tiny penor.
In modern warfare, having the advantage in technology and weaponry is overwhelming when it comes to the act of invasion.
YT needs to shutdown the Russian bots - perhaps I should say 
Meanwhile biden:”W-what where am I?”
You will regret your actions!
Putin has to be destroyed ! We have to destroy Russia ! Long live Ukraine !
cursed  be Russian Putin.   Putin is  Satanic.
OMG! It is just like Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Somalia, Iran, etc, etc. After the western powers attacked all of those nation's based on what we now know was a pack of lies.
Now everyone is with Ukraine, but NATO AND USA are afraid
Beiden and USA has started war with Russia
Praying for every soul in Ukraine..My heart goes out to you...From Ohio in America🙏😢
May God breath you Ukraine.
Repeat of history.
what a time to be alive
Putin in a lying mentally unstable fascist dictator with Napoleon syndrome, evil, pure evil, another Stalin.
Go Putin  go get those  bloody greedy bunch of Nato hyenas 😜
The west wants war!
Meanwhile Biden is taking a nap with his babysitter
#prayforukraine
The money EU countries paid to Russia for natural gas seems to have turned into a life-threatening weapon for the Ukrainian people. 🙄
Send Love you all there!
This isn't as black and white as the west is trying to make it out to be!
Spell much ?
Please grow up, these are kind words but praying won't help
 @NeedMoarRage  What was the point of that dumb comment? She was only wishing for the well being of Ukraine. She is probably helping by donating to the cause.
Ww1 and now rather similar a big war and a deadly disease knocking around
TRAITOR
Prayers to whom?
WHAT Russian missile?, do you mean the ANTAGONIST’S MISSILE from NATO???
2:50 that looks like a SU-27 so safe to say russian.
I wish everyone safety and peace. 🙏

The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures;he leadeth me beside the still waters.  He restoreth my soul; he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name’s sake.  Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies; thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.  Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life; and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.”  ~ 🙏
Same from Canada.
 @kevin maynard  I am gay. I love jesus too
Speak for yourself, pushing a super power to the brink, madness
Praying from UK? Lol you guys invaded half of the world 🌍 you and your generations will always bear the brunt of the bloodshed by your ancestors! Go back to your corner don’t need your sympathy!
'Horrifying Moment' Russian Bombs Drop All Over Ukraine https://youtu.be/ApuUWKuTJzw
 @GunzZ Pumpkin  We stopped the Nazis
UK ha and u people so called west only creating urest in world as it was did several years ago now with a curtain of nato
https://youtu.be/fy910FG46C4
If Putin Swallow Ukraine he will swallow More of European countries and he will become emperor again 🧐Then Russia up 🔼  USA and Europe  down ⬇️ 😑..
 @Harry Ford   lol u believe that it was only 20% efforts of allies of western front to stop Germans all major battels was done by red army stop reading junk allied history
More religious nonsense... cringe
 @GunzZ Pumpkin  You just don't want people to talk about the new Hitler in Europe called Putin. That's why you are trying to change the topic. Well the topic here and now is Putin. Putin has become the epitome of Russia's imperialist aspirations and really stands as the new Hitler of Europe. Ukraine suffers because of that. The new greedy Hitler called Putin wants to conquer its neighboring territories and subjugate other nations. Putin = Hitler
 @GunzZ Pumpkin  tears of jealousy...
 @GunzZ Pumpkin  You say that like The British empire is the only one to invade other countries.Read some history books lad.We got to stop fighting rich people's wars, we've all been brainwashed to hate each other..divide & conquer 👍🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
 @GunzZ Pumpkin  So people who have nothing to do with the sins of their forefathers should be held accountable? Fuck off you absolute dickhead.
Thank in part your stupid alcoholic weak leader. This was not the leaders the West needed. Also Biden is a weak puppet idiot.
Speak for yourself.
 @GunzZ Pumpkin  Absolutely agree with you! All wars because of Anglo-Saxon and this one too.
It was more than half the world more like three quarters
 @GunzZ Pumpkin  HOW DARE YOU insult my great country! A country that with sheer bravery stood alone against Nazi tyranny in 1940 when it would have been so much easier to have surrendered and made a deal with Hitler.Your insults make me think that you must  be A) Jealous     B) A Nazi sympathizer (because if the Britain that you so hate had surrendered to the Nazis in 1940/41 they would have won the Second World War and taken control of the whole world! ) GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!
 @vulc1  Don't tell bullshit
 @GunzZ Pumpkin  I never invaded anyone you pathetic moron. The ancestors you speak of have been dead a long time.  Unlike your countrymen, my ancestors never dropped Napalm bombs which resulted in burning the flesh off children. The sympathy wasn't aimed at you, it isn't in your gift to turn it down.
Why UK doesn’t send army ??? Why NATO is not sending army ? Why even Biden doesn’t send army? Everyone was using Ukraine against Russia and forced Russia to start the war but when Ukraine needs support they’re just praying 🤲 isn’t funny ???
Dont be a beast. Blame the crown not the peolle who are innocent. Its like blaming Germans for what the nazi elite did
FEW EVIL MAN TRIUMPH BECAUSE BILLIONS OF GOOD MEN DO NOTHING!!!!!
 @Harry Ford  Russians stopped the Nazis lol
Does 
Fuck Ukraine they support Israel occupation of Palestine now its there turn fuck then , Ukraine has been committing genocide against Russia ppl living in Ukraine
 @Orpheus Prime  If you are a Christian you will send out prayers to all innocent victims of war, whichever side they are on.
 @Sandeep singh khichi  Do you still shit in the street?
 @PM  Because they loose and that's it. Britain is the weakest army now, their just make it: bla bla bla
 @British Proud Van Man  yes true, u stayed in the island doing nothing
 @Orpheus Prime  Yes. Do you not remember the million man march? Literally everyone in the UK protested the war in Iraq. Only Blair wanted to go because his nose was so far up Bush's ass.
 @Mr Pozhiloy  That is an insult to all the British soldiers who lost their lives whilst trying to liberate mainland Europe during and after D Day 1944, not to mention the campaigns against the Nazis in North Africa, and the Japanese in Japan, and also the valiant and important retreat from Dunkirk in 1940.
 @neil wilko  the lord is your shepherds pie
 @Paul Furey  hey❤ryou might not believe this, butrJesus loves yourHe's coming back againrhave a wonderful day my friend
Guys I am saying this now for people putting silly comments, not everyone in the UK likes our government, not everyone likes the news, not everyone in the UK cares about everyone in the world, but I am the one who does care about the people around the world, I don't like the government cause though I'm 26, I don't vote because I don't care, I don't read it watch the news because all they do is report bad news a lot of the times, but I do care about everyone in the world and hope that their family's gets the help and support they need for any family members of friends living in Ukraine right now, or the ones who have lost their lives to this pointless stupidity that is going on in the Russian government, go ahead to anyone who thumbs down me, I don't care, but what I do care about right now is we should be supporting the people caught in the middle of this and that is the Ukrainian civilians, this is the only reply I am doing, for anyone else I hope you all have a peaceful day #PrayForUkrain
 @Daniel -  There are more than 67 MILLION people living in the UK. 
People who talk shit about the British empire in the past need to look at how those countries actually became better after they were part of the empire. If your countries weren’t such shit and corrupt you’d have defended and not had a problem and could of carried on living like Africa or India.
 @British Proud Van Man  I agree, Britain has a proud history during the Great Wars, unfortunately prior to that, you also had 300yrs of being imperialist scumbags !
 @GunzZ Pumpkin  Stop acting as if people now are accountable for people actions in the past you moron.
 @GunzZ Pumpkin  salty for what mate?
Uk be ready India is coming to make uk Indian colony again British raj 2.0 this time it's India turn
 @GunzZ Pumpkin  we Indian will forgive Britishers if they will handover war criminal queen elizabeth to us we will punish her
 @Harry Ford  Russian stopped the Nazi Uk army was filled with Indian ,Pakistanis ,and other colonistWhite man can't fight
 @Buddha Indian  Lmao india wont do crap
 @StockrA CCFC  shut up britisher
 @Tetrahedral Dolphin  why isn't queen elizabeth in jail handover that war criminal to india
 @Tetrahedral Dolphin  ofcourse you will heard about KARMA
 @Deleted  India can nuke uk to rubble
 @British Proud Van Man  British souildzer were filled with Indian White man can't fight Britishers are weak And they betrayed us indian
 @gio  your ancestors killed 40 million south Asian because of your ancestors we Indians are suferrring your ancestors were thiefs first step would be giving 50% of your monthly income to India that's how you can repay the lotted wealth and yes don't forget to give your mother and daughter for pleasure
 @RY P  India was better before uk we were more civilized then you Barbarian
 @Buddha Indian  Bless another child from some part of the world talking shit. If India did that, they'd be killing their own people you tool, do you know how many Indian people live over here in the Uk, my corner shop is owned by a Indian family ffs. I'd be more worried about Pakistan than the UK lad.
 @Buddha Indian  Remind us again how much money the UK sends India each year.....🍿
 @StockrA CCFC  nothing a penny we can buy uk and keep Elizabeth as slave
 @Buddha Indian  Go on then, off you go, take the rest of the Royal family if you want, anyone else?
 @StockrA CCFC  yes all British who were born at British raj they will be sent to tihar jail You need to send your grandfather too
 @Buddha Indian  tell you what you should do with that money, troll school, you're not very good at it, so with better teaching you can become the uber troll of the internets, imagine that lad.
 @Buddha Indian  Sending my grandfather 🤔 that's going to be a bit difficult lad, so won't be able too. Enrolled in troll school yet?
 @Buddha Indian  That’s a very simplified and exaggerated version of history isn’t it? 😂 People should be more worried about what is happening right now. How about worrying about that madman dictator Vladimir Putin? You never know what he will do next!
 @PM  becuase if the rest of the world goes to war the death toll will be beyond measure, there may be all out nuclear war
 @Orpheus Prime  the British public did not agree with the Iraq/Afghan war, we hate Tony Blair and George Bush.  Unfortunately it's not down to the public, it's the small minority in power that make those decisions.
 @GunzZ Pumpkin  shut up mate, he isn't his ancester.
If you have anyone is Ukraine get into contact with me and we can evacuate them to poland
Does this include the ethnic russians in Donbass (Ukraine) that have been fired at for 8 years by the ukrainian army and slowly starved to death by cutting power, water, food supplies, financial services? Of course western media did not report about that, but it's the hard reality on the ground.
Our country, Japan, has easily crushed the ambitions of the British Empire by force, and has greatly diminished the national power of Britain. If the British reignite their ambition and start to rampage in other countries, please contact Japan and we will crush them to pieces 💪
 @kevin maynard  hey❤ryou might not believe this, butrSuperman loves yourHe's coming back (yet) againrhave a wonderful day my friend
I am guessing they are stationed in Poland, Germany and other NATO countries in Europe and can’t intervene unless the Ukraine Government requests help because once the join in it Putin will just take this as all out war and tell Russian force that they have can start attacking these counties too as they have entered the war.You can be sure though that fully loaded British fighter jets (that can be scrambles in less than 5/10mins) are on full red alert from the threat of a Russian jet fighter entering British airspace and will not hesitate to shoot them down if they don’t leave
We are all praying for Ukraine!
Huuraaa
The US and western now must feel what is means war in european soil they play fouls when the terroriest tplf attacked the ethiopian soliders the weels on the war turn around and around
We “the free world” need to destroy Russia! If war breaks out I’m signing up! I promise you Putin I’ll take a lot you down with me!
I hope the bombing stops 😭 for humanitarian reason there's peace in that region.
My thoughts are with the Ukraines. Western countries aren’t doing anything much. Sanctions aren’t going to stop Putin from further invading the country. God bless the people of Ukraine. My heart goes out to them.
Please we don't want war spread love
Ukraine is going to be worse for Russia than Afghanistan was to USSR or Vietnam was to US.
From outside looking in. Without the involvement of NATO surrounding Russia, this wouldn't be happening.
Stop the war.  Praying we need peace peace and peace
May the universe look after these people x
sTrumpet emboldened Putin a tyrant, to attack Ukraine. He's an ass.
After Hitler and Saddam Hussein, the next war mongerer is standing up.
BUY BITCOIN!!!!
I always support Ukraine to be very grateful! 부터: 후쿠오카에 거주한 대한민국🇰🇷🇯🇵💖🇺🇦
God save Ukraine
Not goated with the sauce... Not goated with the sauce AT ALL
reminds me of iraq and  afghanistan invasion by peaceful  nato
As of today Ukrainians are no longer considered Russian. Putin is  evil he is killing his own people
Klaus Schwab is the real threat to the world, not Russia.
Hi Esther, how are you doing?
Creep 🤣

 @Ludovico Sforza  Mannaggia
You want ww3? Because that's what happens if western countries go to war with Russia.  What about the Eastern countries, all ok ukraine's neighbours?
Why
 @F C  As a Pole, no, we are very much not ok right now. I wish we could send in troops but as you said that would be nuclear suicide. Feeling really frustrated about not being able to do anything more other then protesting and donating to the ukranian military.
https://youtu.be/7Gf6-IgljyE
what do you want them to do? You want mass genocide and an all out world war??
Putin is aware of this, he knows that putting economic sanctions on Russia during a global pandemic is just a bluff, the West cannot afford to do such things during this time, and if they do it will be negligible or will have no effect at all. This will be incredibly costly to both the Russian people and the Ukrainians but Putin is so isolated from the rest of the world he doesn't listen to any of his advisors, he has lost his mind and now the world will suffer for it.
If the Western countries do anything it will start WW3 and shortly after the end of the world.
They start wars, to distract us!https://youtu.be/Uc5zFVmVa2s
Do you remember what is appeasement?
 @Gazza  I don't think he's lost his mind at all...this is a very calculated attack that he has been working towards for quite awhile now. The NATO press conference this morning alluded to them KNOWING this was going to happen for MONTHS. Putin knew there would be heavy economic sanctions put on him so he's been strengthening his economy in preparation. He amassed over 5billion US DOLLARS in Dec bc he knew trade policies/banks would be targeted. He's had this in the works for longer then any of us could imagine
Tf you want them to do?
The west can arm Ukraine, it is not too late! And vow to cut economic ties with Russia.
Sanctions will not stop Putin, but cause suffrage to Russian civilians
 @F C  buddy ww3 is coming either way. Fear of war has given us Putin who doesnt fear war. Who like Hitler before hime will happily march to war.
 @Fro-Bobs  economic sanctions put on him? No, the people who'll suffer from sanctions and consequences of his decisions are ordinary Russians and the country, not this senile warmonger with trillions of dollars at his disposal.He didn't want to give anything to the citizens for covid relief, but now happily spends (not his) money on a war nobody wanted or needed to further ruin Russia's (not his) economy.
 @Fro-Bobs  5 billion dollars is nothing at a country level budget
Europe cant do shit putin will just stop the gas
 @TheBigManUno  Hitler marched into no war
 @Pumpkin 🎃   So be it
difference between 
More direct engagement from the west will just makes things worse at the moment.
 @Oliver Danikiewicz  you would  have  advised  Ukrainians to halt their  NATO  membership  for peace  to reign. Secondly,  implement  the Minsk  agreement with the donbass  republics. All this would  have been  avoided. However  I Sympathise  with the Ukrainian  civilians who are suffering  in this war.
 @Oliver Danikiewicz  I've got family in Poland. Swr there's land in Poland that used to be Russians isn't there? Bit worried they might want to occupy some of that if they've done it with Ukraine
 @F C  ww3 or a slave to evil???  That’s not a hard decision for men
Germany is basically financing these attacks lol
Ukraine is doing anything and it's happening to THEM. i don't want WW3 they need to fight their own battle, the US needs to stay out of it. It's sad but true
If US and NATO helps ukraine it's going to be a world war 3
 @HaeMadrigal  yes but in the end no matter how powerful Russia is, it's no match for a combined nato.
 @Kl R Russia has choppers in Kiev.But yea maybe you’re right
 @Christopher Parker  thinks about china and other Bricks member if there's NATO THERE'S BRICKS EXIST TOO IT'S NOT A GOOD NEWS FOR EVERYONE
I blame USA and NATO for this war
Dumb comment.Would have happened with or without NATO.Drinking up on Russian propaganda this morning. Stop spreading misinfo.
Without the invasion of Ukraine, Ukraine will not even want to join NATO. Why every former slave of Russia wants to join?
 @Kyle Knight  Freedom of speech man relax. It's how I see it and that's what the Russians are saying. Stop with the shaming and the insults. Engage like an adult or don't engage.
 @Anas Amireh  Yep. You cannot surround a big country like that with army bases and think it wouldn't react, that just foolish from NATO and the US.
 @Beeyella Network  Another dumb comment.

'Horrifying Moment' Russian Bombs Drop All Over Ukraine https://youtu.be/ApuUWKuTJzw
 @Echo Bay  more than 60% of the internet is bots.  Unsurprising.  Surely a part of warfare.
 @krunkle  Information warfare, Russia is doing it as we speak I hope the west defends.
 @Daniyal Shah  With plesuare. Come in to Okrainean.
 @SS-Gamerstaat Burgand  I don't know how US would hold up in information warfare, considering the relative distrust in its own institutions.  But I'm probably wrong and of push comes to shove Americans will get behind a common goal and unify.  Fingers crossed.
 @krunkle  yes the Russians have been flooding the internet for years. It all should be regulated
Remember when London hosted the Olympics and Ukraine hosted the Euros . That was 2012. Life was good. Look at what Putin has achieved since. Trump. Brexit. And now this.
The world need to stand up to Putin!!
Russia are attacking and forcing to take over Ukraine and Putin say it is self defence 🤬😡Do the lion need defence from the cat??World have to raise against Russia and others who support this inhuman work in the civilized world 😭😭
always the everyday peoples who sufferskgb vs actorputin = kgb + gangsterpolitician = stupidly + shameless
Thinking of Ukraine 🥺♥️♥️♥️
To Ukraine ❤️💯🙏☮️
Drop some bombs on Moscow. Nobody ever brings the fight to them, not since the Germans.
Praying for Ukraine people 🙏
If only Ukraine listened to reason and dropped the idea of joining the terrorist organization called NATO, this wouldn't have happened. This war can still be stopped if Ukraine declares not to join NATO - terrorist military alliance that has killed thousands of innocent people and destroyed millions of lives.
am i really the first one to comment
IT'S CREDIBLE TO BELIEVE THAT COMMUNIST ARE POSSESSED BY DEMONS THAT ABHOR COLLECTIVE FREEDOM AND PROSPERITY A RIGHT TO SELF DETERMINE

LMAO

All the problem is NATO. NATO was created against Russia and destroy Russia. If someone join with it, it represents there act against Russia
 @Nikolai Novogovovich  You're on a frequency only dogs can hear. Shut your trap.
Putin has finally crossed the line and now WAR is declared!! Putin is nothing more than a lying Russian dictator and a bully and will go down in history along side the likes of Stalin, Poi Pot, Saddam Hussein, Osama Bin Laden, Robert Mugabe, Genghis Khan, Idi Amin, Mao Tse-Tung,  and Hitler if he doesn’t turn his troops around and send the,back to Russia now.This is all down to the fact that Russia do not want Ukraine to join NATO and if he carry’s on The Hague will have him up for War crimes as he has absolutely NO RIGHT to do what he is doing after all what has Ukraine done to Russia ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.Putin says this is all self defence, well I don’t know how when Russia were the first to start  firing missiles, all Ukraine are doing are,just trying to defend themselves.AND REMEMBER PEOPLE LIKE RUSSIA OR NOT JUST REMEMBER THEY STARTED THIS NOT NATO, UKRAINE OR THE WEST
If anyone, especially NATO, tries to intervene, a global nuclear war is possible. It's better for the world, unfortunately, that they let Russia take over Ukraine and that's it. Any action taken would mean the doom of our civilization.
The world does not revolve around a country with no-nuclear weapons, a lower GDP than Bosnia and Kosovo, plus a Neo-Nazi regiment in their own armed forces with political representation (Azov Detachment) There are more problems in the world than  a world  power invading another broke country.
 @J.P. Nery N.  Let it be , Russia need to be wiped from the map
 @J.P. Nery N.  U think Putin is going to stop in Ukraine? He have his eyes on Europe.
they have nukes like so many other nations, it would mean the end of our world if Moscow is bombed.
https://youtu.be/7Gf6-IgljyE
Well the Indian pm has already backed out.
I wish every country back out from this madness especially US.
 @rayan  that's a good thing . We are Non Alingned . Our only enemies are China and Pakistan
I definitely agree with your comment, that leaders almost never really think for their citizens, especially in the times of war
I somehow feel that Russia has justified reasons for this Invasion . They can't after all afford to have NATO on their doorstep
 @Rudraksh   Pakistan want be india like a territories country like Pakistan
 @Rudraksh   Ah... yes... the non aligned reason.Put it simply, India is afraid to enrage Putin, since India feels it cannot confront China alone.All while Russia keeps getting closer to China. 🤣
 @Indra Gunawan  Russia's alliance with China is totally due to Western sanctions over Crimea.
 @Indra Gunawan  Its good if India is afraid of Putin as they atleast know the consequences of war...unlike you.
 @Rudraksh   yes! I heard bangladesh was acting shit too, also literally there isn't anything india is supposed to oelr could do.....
 @Johny Lalrina  there was political business from USA to Ukraine, I think thats the main reason
 @Indra Gunawan  Russia does not view its relations with india from a chinese perspective . India returns the favor by not viewing its relations with US into the russian equation . Russia helped india in wepons production . They helped india in building nuclear submarines and cruise missiles , tanks , etc . Don't you take it from your perspective . BTW , india has no buisness in that part of the world
 @Indra Gunawan  We are more than capable of confronting china alone . Our military is the 4th most powerful in the world with 44 divisions , 140 Brigades, 150 warships , 2500 aircraft backed by 160 Nukes .

Long Live Russia
This is Poland 1939 all over again
War not good for human
These images are very reminiscent of the US, UK and NATO Invasion of Iraq.  There, they also did not listen to the UN.  We already have the precedent.
This war is very good. Oil price will increase.
Yes but can we trust the BBC?Are we sure this isn’t another war?I mean they have allegedly pushed BS before and even started wars in the Middle East with fake news like a certain gas attack.The propaganda being pushed is crazy right now and it is no wonder a Russian gangster is taking the piss. The BBC cannot even agree on the sex of the office ‘person’ so why should we trust a word they say about anything like (I don’t know - The End Of The World!
Россияне, выходите на Марши Протеста! Призовите Армию РФ валить домой!✊💛
Its incredible how calm some people are while filming these videos. I’d run the sh*t out of my a*s if i heard a bomb dropping above me. All my prayings for the people in ukraine, i hope another alternative is found at some point.🇲🇽💙🇺🇦
Wait… What? Are you telling me that Trump’s best friend is a liar? What will they tell us next? Next you’ll tell me that Trump is a liar. Of course most of this is common freaking sense.

It's all fault of west they act like they are boss but can't do shit russia gave them warning long ago
Nice to see spanish.
Putin is a Nazi.. Putin = Hitler. Same beliefs as Hitler.
 @Mr Bald  Let's see if Putin is stupid enough to invade any nato territory like Hitler did when he invaded Poland. Because I'll be honest with Putins mental state and how committed he is, he's already started he won't finish until Ukraine falls otherwise it would have been for nothing. I don't think Ukraine will last long if I'm being honest... he has to gain something, no point in turning back for him now..
 @ARFG Rogue  Believe me NATO cannot stand up to China
When it all kicked off the other year it was down to EU funding opposition groupgroups to overthrow the democratically elected Government so they could instal a PRO NATO PRO EU Government. ...Both NATO and the EU went back on their agreements NOT to expand their influence Eastward
 @KARM  It’s all our fault we are the superpower of the planet, we can’t do shit but watch because if we do smoke the Russians it’ll start nuclear warfare
 @KARM  ItS AlL ThE WeSt FaUlT, totally not human kinds fault. Nooo, there's no way human nature is the cause of destruction. Bring on nuclear winter.
 @Flock 9  super power my ass west is nothing destroyed middle East killed innocent instead of uplifting poor countries and west is being colonized by arabs and then there are social justice warrior and LGBTQ cult rather than doing NATO expansion if only people can focus of real issue like global warming education

Bloomberg stocks, and US Dollar is going higher...... WHY is this possible????
 @KARM  Warning about what? None invaded in Russia's territory. If Russia don't like the West then he can always go make other allies instead. They're big enough to take care of themselves anyways. There's absolutely no need for a violent respons.
https://youtu.be/zFJ2AN_CZH8
 @KARM  right... Russian 
It's funny when Indians shed crocodile tears for anybody but when their own forces kill Kashmiris or Sikhs or when they see Israelis killing Palestinians they leave funny comments about them.
 @KARM  There is no global warming? Earth has always been changing?
Your media doesnt give you all the picture. This situation has been developing ever since 2014 and Ukraine is being turned into martyr to demonise russia while hiding atrocities ukraine itself did. Add to that refusal of west to solve things diplomatically.All politicans are criminals that only care about voters and personal gain.
No
What an awful thing to say in this moment. Shame on you.
You should be ashamed.
Russia is fighting for its security
Why didn't The West approves the Russian request of not letting join Ukraine NATO
It was an American propganda to use Ukraine against Russia
 @Durgesh Tiwari  shut up Ukraine done nothing to Russia

And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer. And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, Come and see. And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword. And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine. And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see. And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth. Revelation 6:2-8
It’s happening all because Ukraine wanted to join NATO and when Russia heard about this then turned around (with no authority) and said no you can’t we will not let this happen.
absolutly
Putin is a warmonger - he doesn't want peace.
 @FRANCI MERRY  he wants russia to get stronger disregarding other countries
 @dusty  Agree - where will he stop?
Get lost
America is not as powerful anymore as you think , they cannot help .
All USA did was provoke Ukraine into this conflict and then left it high and dry)
Americans use Ukrainians as human flesh.They pushed them into the war with Russia
They already provided arms and hospitals months ago. Are you following the news?
recall what US did in Afghanistan
As an american I dont know the truth. I see the news but it could be nato attacking russia for all I know. 30+ years of lies. I will never believe what state sponsored media says again.
AFTER JUDGEMENT DAY REVELATION 20:15 WILL HAVE NO MISTAKES

The world peoples enjoy once the. Attack on syria iraq and other muslim countries so let them enjoy with croitia
Did you not exist in Syria? What betrayal did you not have?  Do you remember in the dirty and filthy organization that you countries gave this filthy name to the United Nations? You all shed dramatic tears.  And this woman buried thousands of Muslims alive. Instead of prosecuting this president, you gave a gold medal to this dirty and filthy woman.  Resolve themselves with valuable words. You are interfering with evil countries. Why, if you want to defend the rights of these countries so much, first punish the same betrayals that you and the country that buried people alive?  You are not punishing because you are all dirty countries in the name of NATO, you are all dirty and Saudi Arabia is you  He takes him as a Muslim and talks about being a Muslim. This country, Saudi Arabia, is a cow. He does not talk, because he is a cow. When someone is a cow, what else can he describe?  You, the evil countries, have magnified these small words so that this country will not fall to the ground of bloodshed and you will reach your sinister goal, which is looting, murder, robbery and corruption.  You know best that today is very interesting, like the dogs that bark and miss something.  They do not come. Obviously, the same dogs are digging. It is very shameful for all of you. You are making funny words in front of so many people on the ground.  You are such a man, let him attack the top of Russia, it is very shameful, but unfortunately you are not ashamed.  Bring my country, you have massacred this country for twenty years in the wrongful forms that you were in Afghanistan, and then you threw it on top of your terrorist partners.  You killed this nation this year by the same vampire and terrorist Taliban, and then you oppressed this terrorist, the high power of this nation, but your coming was useless.  The Republic of Ukraine and the people of Ukraine for this k  My passion made me think that you were thinking for the sake of your nation. Today, the people of Ukraine are moving in the same direction as my dear country, Afghanistan. I hope it does not. I hope that you will not kill this nation.  Let your country go to ruin, please solve it patiently with the word of forgiveness. Do not let this nation and innocent people be dragged to the ground of blood. Have a good time.
How is situation there? if u need a place im ready to shelter u

https://youtu.be/7Gf6-IgljyE
please dismiss your bad actor BOJO
The Russian military action in Eastern parts of the Ukraine was always going to be characterised as ‘Russian aggression’ by the Western media. However, what the Western media omits is the fact that NATO have been expanding eastward towards Russia’s borders since the end of the Cold War – this is despite verbal agreements that NATO would not engage in such actions. NATO is now nothing more than an instrument of American interventionism and when viewing this situation from both sides, Russia’s demands that NATO ceases their military expansion in Eastern Europe and does not place its forces ever closer to Russia’s borders, is, to say the least, very reasonable and understandable.
 @louis ecorchevolle  we tried aha. but now is not the time, after it's ended then we will try again
NATO = No Action Talk Only.
This is America and UKs FAULT that's not love.... GIVE UKRAINE BACK AND STAY OUT OF THEIR BUISNESS WE CAN NOT GO FIGHTING GLOBAL SUPERPOWERS AND EXPECT LIFE TO CONTINUE
shut up , they dont need your love. Your love dont mean shit to them. As if your love is somehow gonna save them
They start wars, to distract us!https://youtu.be/Uc5zFVmVa2s
It's the UKs fault again?? How many more times will the British and Americans get blamed for this? 🤣
Big love to USA for starting it all in 2014 there, you Brits are very good people too.
 @James Smith  Russia has no power to control organizations like NATO. Every country is free to join NATO, and so is Ukraine. Russia is used to controlling every single one of their neighbours, opressing them and flat out killing opposition. Putin is starting a war because he can't control all eastern european countries anymore.
 @Dalton Bailey  you can find all the information about sponsoring the maidan in Ukraine by USA in open sources. Imagine all of a sudden in 2014 there's a conflict in Ukraine? Russia and Ukraine couldn't start it all without the US, we are too close. Millions of people have relatives on both sides, you regular Brits and Muricans seem to fail to understand this simple fact.
​ @James Smith How can it be anything but aggression??? Was NATO going to kill civilians in Russia?? No
Just terrible for the Ukrainian people. I'm sure if you speck with Russian people they don't want this either. As if this world hasn't got enough to worry over what with covid for nearly 3yrs. This will have a knock on affect for the whole world. We are with you Ukraine 🇬🇧
then ask uk to send their army prayers wont help
 @Dalton Bailey  Ukrainian politicians are your pawns, you just don't know shit
 @James Smith    NATO is invited by those countries. Russia comes in at the point of a gun.
 @James Smith  You conveniently avoided mentioning the sovereign nature of Ukraine, the country Russia just invaded.
 @Hell Cat  I'm a realist, not a historian. Everytime something like this happens, it's always some western asset that seems to get the blame. I suppose next British colonization is gonna come up or Americans are way too stuck up (which might be true). But last time I checked, those tanks that are rolling into Kyiv, the missiles that are hitting their airport, they belong to Russia. So bringing up the past definitely isn't gonna help here.
 @Inbucks Wetrust  Our pawns?! Get a clue.
@James Smith You are victim blaming. All Putin is doing, is proving that it was a good Idea for Eastern European countries to protect themselves against an aggressive Russian dictator, by joining NATO.This isn't some limited action in the east of Ukraine - it's an all-out invasion.Don't be surprised if this leads Sweden and Finland joining NATO in the next few months.Putin is a despot and a maniac.
 @James Smith  Russia can demand what it wants , It has nothing to do with russia who joins NATO . To be fair lots and lots more countrys  will want to join now . and that agreement you talk of was with the USSR who no longer exists
https://youtu.be/fy910FG46C4
 @Mahesh Raveendra  YAY Another trolling fake account!!! Youtube needs to clear these off
 @Michael Tapley  what are you talking about? Give Ukraine back to who? Ukraine belongs to themselves. Who is to say if Putin conquers Ukraine he won’t move further into Europe? Invade Germany? France? Poland? This is dangerous stuff. People don’t realise the gravity of the situation here. This war is going to be BIG.
 @Michael Tapley  YAY yet another fake trolling account!!!! Yet another account to report!
 @rahul B  why, so you can blame the U.K. and US when it all goes wrong. Send your family to fight.
God shave the queen.
Big love is not  going to save those innocent Ukrainian children. Where is your government when Ukraine needs them most. They are busy drafting sanctions as if Putin cares about their stupid sanctions. The blood of those children is on your government's hands too.
 @Nicholas Jolt  Surely the blood of those children would be on Putin's and Russian hands, as the actual literal force invading and bombing?
Rootin' Tootin' Putin p0wn'd  Ukraine....  n00bs.  Ukraine had YEARS to arm every citizen & install air defenses.    Ukraine had time to buy tanks & jets  & even nuclear weapons if they could afford them.Now the Ukraine people have to become Like Afganistan...make USSR run home.  make USA abandon everything and leave thousands of people behind.

Putin has finally crossed the line and now WAR is declared!! Putin is nothing more than a lying Russian dictator and a bully and will go down in history along side the likes of Stalin, Poi Pot, Saddam Hussein, Osama Bin Laden, Robert Mugabe, Genghis Khan, Idi Amin, Mao Tse-Tung,  and Hitler if he doesn’t turn his troops around and send the,back to Russia now.This is all down to the fact that Russia do not want Ukraine to join NATO and if he carry’s on The Hague will have him up for War crimes as he has absolutely NO RIGHT to do what he is doing after all what has Ukraine done to Russia ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.Putin says this is all self defence, well I don’t know how when Russia were the first to start  firing missiles, all Ukraine are doing are,just trying to defend themselves.AND REMEMBER PEOPLE LIKE RUSSIA OR NOT JUST REMEMBER THEY STARTED THIS NOT NATO, UKRAINE OR THE WEST
GOD KEEP YOU SAFE
💜💜💜💜
Let Putin take his land he RIGHTFULLY OWNS back you traitor 🇷🇺🇷🇺
Don't be funny.
💚💚💚
I can't believe that this is happening. I'm from warsaw and my thoughts are with you all and your country. When I heard the siren, I felt chills. I only heard that siren in the warsaw uprising museum. I cried, I bloody can't believe this. I hope Ukrainians find safety for now and that Europe and closest neighbours will help.
😡
keep safe and fight brave
Why is this happening ?
I hope that other countries can/will help stop this. I would hate to see a war but this is terrorism and should be fought. I expected my country’s government to deploys troops and offers immediate aid but I don’t think that’s going to happen.
Unfortunately your country is dysfunctional, kleptocratic non democratic because russophone cannot have Russian lessons or teaching in Russian at School mostly  Ukraine admire Stepan Bandera a nazi collaborator and you have memorial in Lvov to the memory os a SS division Galichina
You are already great, and so is your name! 🙏🙏🙏

Best of luck brother
Godspeed
I understand your need to do that and I have so much respect for you. I pray that you survive this horrible war. I'm so sorry this is happening to your people
Nothing will be done in Russia, in Ukraine, in China or in the whole world, pandemic or war, without consent of Rothchild and Rockefeller. So be careful about this.
God stay as safe as you can. This is a damned nightmare.
Make sure you take cover well and be very vigilant!
My prayers is with you. Love from India.
good. fight for a country that isso corrupt its not even funny, gl with that. remember ukraine and usa started this not russia.
From what you appear to be saying, Putin, who in thinking that a softening up of the Ukrainian spirit  through Airstrikes will break your resolve, has mad a very serious miscalculation. He doesn’t want to destroy a country which he hopes to take intact, and doesn’t want a ground war, which could grind on for months, and prove too expensive both in terms of the economy, and huge loss of troops,  during which, the West will be fortifying its positions on its Borders and preparing for war. Is this Russia spreading itself thin once again, and Putin taking us all down with him, as an old Soviet with a grudge would prefer to do, rather than see defeat.
Good luck......praying for peace....❤ from india
Good luck may god be with you and your fellow brothers in arms
 @K Martin  The USA and the west will do jack squat in reality. They have to date sanctions and diplomatic appeasement is it. Of course ample talk will continue as that's pretty much about it.
 @K Martin  usa under biden is likea puppy. no balls and no bite. usa isnt gonna do shit. they wanted this war. they started it with help of ukraine. russia didnt. just another blind dumb fuck.
More balls than me. I would leave with them
Be safe brother and I hope you succeed
 @Kg Miller 2  go away troll
Better be quick the Russians will be in Kyiv tonight 😂
Send those russians to Hel brother

Nah man go with your family y’all will lose
You’re so brave For this
My heart bleeds 😢😢
 @K Martin  And what will you do exactly? It sounds rather hollow…….
 @K Martin  Biden won't do anything and Putin knows it
 @D A  never have respect for a criminal like Putin…….
Amazing considering the current situation, you still have time to drop a comment here.. Go ahead brother, defend your land..
Good luck brother. Take care
Please be safe my prayers to you and your family and all other people
damn hard life
Rip.....
The only way to stop Putin is to target Putin or people who surround Putin.Fighting with Russian soldiers is the most stupid thing to do. I bet that most Russian soldiers do not want to fight too. Of course in each army there some people with low IQ and psychopathic brains but that is the minority.
never give up
May the force be with you.
Sorry we won't help for now other than money, equipment, and tyring to secure your online communication/banking. In a way we should hope that one bullet or soldier accidentally ends up in a NATO country. If they don't; go full out on his troops (outdated material) and him...I will personally drive to Moscow and blow his brains out.
Secure food sources, start distributing seeds
 @Lorne M  sorry. Better look at your history. It's also a sovereign nation. It was never 
Who has been instigating and supporting you in the war, now all are hiding behind the war, only the Ukrainians have lost their lives.

God bless you, saying a prayer for you and your family.
Be safe, love from Israel 🙏🏻
Ну что присоединился уже?

Trzymaj się ❤️🇵🇱
I think thats suicide mission..
🥺🥺🥺 please stay safe stay strong! You are brave
Meh, people will say anything for a few virtue points, and too many dimwits are only too happy to provide those points. 🙄
May your beautiful heart protect you and your country.
Godspeed
Wishing you the best of luck on the battle field, hope you make it though.
That's what heroes do..
Praying for God to protect all Ukrainian and the whole country 🙏🙏🙏 victory victory victory is only depends on you my Lord and my God. Please protect Ukraine against this heartless Putin
fighting for your own country isnt worth it no offense
Forza Ukraine brother❤️
Be strong brother 💪The world is with you
Why weren't you at the front line already? 👩‍🚀🇺🇲⚒️🇷🇺

Be safe.
Goodluck man
 @Snaggal Frash  ah, a Putin troll.
More power to u
Praying for you
 @TheCandiceWang  never trust a rush man, is this how they all are?
 @louis ecorchevolle  I believe you are a troll coming from the notorious troll factory in Saint Petersburg, but just in case you are not, here's your answer:you're brainwashed and you justify an unprovoked invasion of a democratic and sovereign country, Zelensky has jewish heritage, Ukraine is not a Nazi country, your words are exactly the same as that of your dictator, Putin. Any Ukrainian blood is on your hands. Russians are going down in history the same way as the Germans did in 1939. The world is watching you and your nation will be condemned and hated much stronger than ever by all the world. Remember that.
 @Eli Le scholten  that's what they said about America a LONG time ago...
Godspeed
Good luck 🍀 keep safe
GODSPEED 🇺🇦
God bless you Aleksandr and Ukraine.

 @The atomic bear  why you laughing?
I'm sorry to hear this. I hope the best possible out come for you and your family who are fleeing. Putin can't get away with taking another piece of Ukraine like it did back in 2014. Forget Russias warnings the West needs to bite rather than bark 🇬🇧 🇺🇦
 @Bernese Dog  shut up with your anti Biden BS. If American goes in, you will be btching that America needs to mind her own business.

Hope both you and your family stay safe!
Stupid you wil die for a corruption man?
 @Lorne M  🙄 and do what with it? Split it in pieces to his rich friends? No ordinary Russian civilian will get a better life due to this war. This is all Putin's ego. If he really had Russia's interest at heart, he would seek to better things for his people, not attract more sanctions.
Hopefully you won’t be on your own a the nato gorvments will help as much as possible stay strong brother 💪🏻
Stay strong🇧🇸🥰

Do God's work brother. Keep him first and foremost. Love you bro
You and your family as well as Ukraine are in my prayers 🙏🏾💛
 @2nd Armored Hell on wheels  Unfortunately… America. I wouldn’t say I’m very patriotic. It’s hard to ignore how much carbon we emit, the slave labor we use in other countries, the sanctioning of economically crippled countries, raising tariffs, ordering air strikes on countries who sell oil in their own currency, racism, sex trafficking, gluttony, a toxic political system and biased media coverage, etc. Americans can be selfish, arrogant, and careless but there are also lots of well intentioned, selfless Americans. Sorry on behalf of America. Sorry for the essay
Aww your comment making me cry😭😭😭😭
Get safe. Get to your family. I'm with you in spirit. From Redding CA USA
Good lock and stay strong 💞💞💞💞
Wait u BUILT SOMETHING 😳
Good luck, beat back the new communist regime of Russia.
joining germany's 6th SS army? You will lose your humanity doing that! This is about the u.s./british fiscal cartel trying to get a monopoly over 30% of the global oil supply.Don't kid your self the imperial britsh united states have the slightest interest in preserving yours or your families life if that is all you have, they will take it without any compensation!
Fight hard and well brother
Stay strong brother. I hope the U.K. can assist Ukraine in its struggle.
good luck,stay safe!!!!!!!!
God be with you 🙏🏻
 @Milan Drazic  try it with someone your own size, bet he won’t
yes lets forget about the uprising of the national social parties in ukraine...the gas stealing and other shit... 
 @K Martin  I think we should stay out of this war I feel sorry but he'll Ukraine and I pray for them but we can't get involved in this if we get involved it would drag the rest of us down
God bless you 🥺🥺🥺
nah screw russia
Sadly like his dad, he doesn't know how to pull out
Why would he sent troops in just to pull them out soon?
 @Dennis  destruction level infinity 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😂😂😂
always the everyday peoples who sufferskgb vs actorputin = kgb + gangsterpolitician = stupidly + shameless
No chance,Putin won’t stop now until Russia controls the whole of the country and countries on the west of Ukraine should be very very scared that he does enter their counties next.
Vladimir poutuin est un dictateur
God save the Queen.

Hey Putin… this song is for you 😡https://youtu.be/nXspsfoPX50
We stand with Ukraine....
woo hoo WW3 !
As a human of this world 🌎 my heart  goes to the Ukrainian people 🇺🇦 ❤
These sky attacks upon Ukraine are pretty terrifying.
Putin has finally crossed the line and now WAR is declared!! Putin is nothing more than a lying Russian dictator and a bully and will go down in history along side the likes of Stalin, Poi Pot, Saddam Hussein, Osama Bin Laden, Robert Mugabe, Genghis Khan, Idi Amin, Mao Tse-Tung,  and Hitler if he doesn’t turn his troops around and send the,back to Russia now.This is all down to the fact that Russia do not want Ukraine to join NATO and if he carry’s on The Hague will have him up for War crimes as he has absolutely NO RIGHT to do what he is doing after all what has Ukraine done to Russia ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.Putin says this is all self defence, well I don’t know how when Russia were the first to start  firing missiles, all Ukraine are doing are,just trying to defend themselves.AND REMEMBER PEOPLE LIKE RUSSIA OR NOT JUST REMEMBER THEY STARTED THIS NOT NATO, UKRAINE OR THE WEST
Never thought that i would love nato at this moment
The queen? Let’s just save ourselves eh?
I draw the line at that
what Queen 🤣

 @TheDruid  yes bro

What's that going to do?
 @Jamie  wishful thinking

А за 14 тысяч людей погибших в ЛНР и ДНР ты не молилась? которых убили националисты из Украины и их армия, постоянно обстреливающая эти территории...нет или тебе об этом не сообщали твои 
 @Aileen Fairfax  yes.
for all Russias
https://youtu.be/7Gf6-IgljyE
praying does NOT  help
Msia will face rising prices of goods, especially crude oil & petrol due to the Slavic-Russo-Ukrainian War.Russia has long attacked Ukraine (the same tactic in Georgia), plus a month -long emergency. Regardless, I don't feel that way. But, that is all for the justice of MH17 & weakening american influence even though the issue of Muslims in Crimea is still disputed. Try to remember that if the US attacks Afghanistan, it will always see the signs of the end -time war. Ukraine & Georgia want to join NATO, but Russia does not want this to happen because security is threatened. What will the Islamic country do if we want to support good things for the Muslim community. Just like what happened in Iran & Afg'stan etc.(Krisis / Russia-Ukraine Crisis)Although 🇷🇺 & Prez. Putin was severely criticized for the State ☪️, but he still loved ☪️ for defending the Prophet Muhammad SAW. It feels like 🇺🇦 & Crimea should also learn a little about 🇵🇸, Uyghur etc. Article Slavic War (🇷🇺-🇺🇦), a little difficult because the views of Muslims are different.When I look at the news (🗞️📰📺) & the internet (🌐🖥️📶), it's full of baseless propaganda, let alone Islamophobia. Guess this is the reason why I consider the Islamic State to support Russia for reasons of Diplomacy, Dialogue (Calling on both countries to refrain), Military & Economic Support, as well as the Muslim community. If you think back 🇲🇾, 🇮🇷, 🇵🇰, 🇦🇫, 🇹🇷, 🇵🇸, 🇶🇦, 🇧🇦, 🇰🇿 etc. have the same view on the issue.
Mumbling to yourself should help a lot.......
 @Shadow  Russian alcoholics get out of the Crimea and Donbass. This is Ukrainian land
NATO = No Action Talk Only.
They start wars, to distract us!https://youtu.be/Uc5zFVmVa2s
Praying is not enough
Pray for yourself. The whole world is going to be brought down with Ukraine. This war will not be localised
🇺🇦🤝🇸🇪
Fuck usa
The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures;he leadeth me beside the still waters.  He restoreth my soul; he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name’s sake.  Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies; thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.  Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life; and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.”  ~ 🙏
I fake
Lets cut the BS! Prayers are a way of avoiding responsibility for acting! We all have a responsibility as a world community to ACT to stop this, NOT to console ourselves with 
Erm, Reminder that ukraine is a corrupt puppet regime that is in the pocket of the demons that run USA.
Any sympathies left for Iraq?
 @Jamie  her good mood, she doesnt pray for ukrainian, she prays because that makes her feel better
 @Iddris Ibrahim  Fuck humans to begin with. Everyone's a monster silly
 @Project Szymon  yeh. 👍🏻
 @Out of the box  yes for the people, but that one's a complex issue with decades of baggage, Ukraine is not, it is a simple case of one country penetrating their border, with the rest of the world in agreement it's wrong, so we should be standing on that border with the Ukrainian people defending it with them. We have the strength to do it & all of Europe at least is under threat if we, the world, don't act now. There's a clear line to defend, we cannot move that line everytime a dictator orders us to give them more territory!
Nice thought, but Prayers have never solved anything.
<3 peace
Amen.
 @The man from Taured  no doubt. 😂

LONG  LIVE  MOTHER  RUSSIA  &  SERBIA  !   🇷🇺🇷🇸
KOSOVO,  MACEDONIA,  MOTENEGRO,  BOSNIA  ARE  GREAT SERBIA
 @Jamie  it’s meaningless comment.
 @Carter Hayes  yeh, i guess.
 @Shadow  wow this is news to me.Please can you post some further info on Ukraine killing 14,000 innocents.Because it's news to me and the rest of the world.I hear Putin say something about it, but Putin has a track record of making things up, so it's nice to verify those sorts of claims.
Relax people. She means that as a way to show her support for Ukraine. I prefer these comments better than a holes justifying this invasion. Also let's donate if it's available in our countries.
 @Jamie  Then you should help as well.
 @Me Here  if you're not going to do anything yourself then shut your trap😂
 @Jamie  your arrogant in front of your creator, but little do u care that this shameful attitude will have u screaming in regret on the certain day. Fix yourself, this mindset of yours is pathetic and shortsighted.
Where are you in the West When it comes to the Eastern Mediterranean, you are in the middle when it comes to Syria? Pray for Ukraine?
 @oooooh mince   Don't be a dickhead.
​ @Dave Webster  Всё это есть в ООН и был официальный отчёт, где раненых и убитых в общем 40+ тысяч,  14 тысяч убиты из них 10 тысяч это жители Донбасса и 4 украинские военные.Донбасс не атакует, а обороняется...Даже смотря на ваши карты, с 2014 года военные Украины продвинулись вглубь территории Донбасса...а не наоборот.И Украина обстреливала постоянно Донбасс, но ваши власти и сми об этом молчат...А как Украина продвинулась так близко к Донбассу, если она соблюдает минск? США и ЕС врут поддерживая фашистов у власти, которые за 8 лет только и делали что убивали жителей Донбасса и продвигались вглубь Донецкой области.Всё это для того чтобы наложить санкции на Россию.Скрыть свои проблемы, найдя общего врага...так было всегда.
 @neil wilko  Grow up
Does this include the ethnic russians in Donbass (Ukraine) that have been fired at for 8 years by the ukrainian army and slowly starved to death by cutting power, water, food supplies, financial services? Of course western media did not report about that, but it's the hard reality on the ground.
No way I thought you were a cat🤦‍♂️
And my heart  goes to NATO.
Being frnd of USA is dangerous Ukraine got betrayed
You should join Ukraine army instead of saying sweet words.

Msia will face rising prices of goods, especially crude oil & petrol due to the Slavic-Russo-Ukrainian War.Russia has long attacked Ukraine (the same tactic in Georgia), plus a month -long emergency. Regardless, I don't feel that way. But, that is all for the justice of MH17 & weakening american influence even though the issue of Muslims in Crimea is still disputed. Try to remember that if the US attacks Afghanistan, it will always see the signs of the end -time war. Ukraine & Georgia want to join NATO, but Russia does not want this to happen because security is threatened. What will the Islamic country do if we want to support good things for the Muslim community. Just like what happened in Iran & Afg'stan etc.(Krisis / Russia-Ukraine Crisis)Although 🇷🇺 & Prez. Putin was severely criticized for the State ☪️, but he still loved ☪️ for defending the Prophet Muhammad SAW. It feels like 🇺🇦 & Crimea should also learn a little about 🇵🇸, Uyghur etc. Article Slavic War (🇷🇺-🇺🇦), a little difficult because the views of Muslims are different.When I look at the news (🗞️📰📺) & the internet (🌐🖥️📶), it's full of baseless propaganda, let alone Islamophobia. Guess this is the reason why I consider the Islamic State to support Russia for reasons of Diplomacy, Dialogue (Calling on both countries to refrain), Military & Economic Support, as well as the Muslim community. If you think back 🇲🇾, 🇮🇷, 🇵🇰, 🇦🇫, 🇹🇷, 🇵🇸, 🇶🇦, 🇧🇦, 🇰🇿 etc. have the same view on the issue.
Russia TERRORIST #1
While their Military is active, Russia should colonize Africa and start an Empire. Taking Africa is the normal and easy thing to do for a European nation.
This is real life Super Villain stuff. Unbelievable. Putin will not survive this, he can't.
And my heart goes to russia
It's China's 🇨🇳 fault. Xi 
NATO = No Action Talk Only.
 @KARM  It is Putin that needs to be afraid.  Not today as the civilized world had no desire to start a war. Only a fool can want to destabilize our world.  I am sure Putin feels he will win as he has caused his oil to be more valuable. Yet it is his greed that blinds him.  Putin has started this war. I have faith in the Russian people that they will not allow his reckless acts to destroy their lives .  The  world will not move from this day without making sure Putin and all who support him will suffer for today.
 @Mahesh Raveendra  yes
Same here we are all human... help us all
hey❤ryou might not believe this, butrJesus loves yourHe's coming back againrhave a wonderful day my friend

Trump tried to destroy NATO for Putin. Now we know why.
 @Vlad bond China covid TERRORIST #1
NATO save us , sorry NATO won't save u
 @KARM  they’re not part of NATO. There were no promises made
NATO not going to do anything because Russia is nuclear power. Trump was right- NATO is obsolete.
 @Mot Goaiu  Stop trying to get people of your channel by spamming a link it’s not how it works
Yes, as well ad all people. Blame NATO and the west for this. Here is my assessment of what could have prevented a war between Russia and Ukraine that the media is not telling you. Let’s have a debate by commenting on this video, watch this clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dURbVp6gM0
During the 1962 Cuba issue, USSR is portrayed (in the west) as the aggressor, they wanted to place their weapons on the USA border.  The defender, USA raised their right to defend their border.  In response, the aggressor, USSR, withdrew and this prevented loss of life. The aggressor today is NATO who want to place their weapons on the Russian border.  Like USA in 1962, Russia has raised their right to defend their border. NATO WARMONGERS, the aggressors today, are refusing to withdraw and are therefore responsible for every life that is lost.For refusing to withdraw as USSR did, any loss of life is clearly at the hands of NATO and NATO alone.
@J P Real life isn't like one of your lame marvel movies. No amount of funko pops you cradle at night will change that.
 @Pandasrules  should???????? Wtf???
 @Mot Goaiu  And how about you stop spamming bot
 @unknown  😠🙄
 @Devout Muslim  same goes with you
 @Pandasrules  That's a TERRIBLE idea! White supremacists has stolen enough from my people!
All the rich people and their friends left the country, but I'm sure their heart goes out to the people they left behind 👍
Btw, Reminder that ukraine is a corrupt puppet regime that is in the pocket of the demons that run USA. Say bye to your future.
No blame NATO! NATO is the aggressor.
What about Iraq?
Is all biden fault force Putin witch date to be in war, the U.S has no peace, the putin mind was like, well since Biden ask putin to have war then no choice to start war because of Biden
Return to Russia is the real freedom the Ukrainian can have. Long live brotherhood 🇷🇺🇨🇳
 @Suction   It's USA's fault they want to have bases in Ukraine and they're everywhere !!
and does your heart have also anything for the people of Donbass? Nope?
 @Mahesh Raveendra  nato can roar Against week countries
I see you got ready with your stupid flag like they do in FaceBook in your profile picture, clown.

yes
 @Wrath Angel  lol 🤣
 @Out of the box  Reminder that ukraine is a corrupt puppet regime that is in the pocket of the demons that run USA.
 @Ndifreke Otu  Yes NATO is the agressor. They back Ukraine and give them weapons and money as Ukraine shells civilians in donetsk and lugansk.
Fake news ww3 would be the Indian profacy and they passed water legislation. I have faith peace will happen war will stop.
 @Cnupoc  ???
Russia is violating the sovereignty of Ukraine without impunity
🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
Where is your heart when NATO invaded others countries...
 @KARM  how?
Did you say the same when The US and UK invade Iraq based on fake facts?
 @Wrath Angel  I wish I could, but guess what we can't lol. This comment is even more stupid than the words op said
 @Devout Muslim  and you muslim puppet of communist.
if trump was a president of united states of America this could be world was 3 🙈🙈
How come your heart only goes out to the Ukrainian people now? Ukrainians have been shelled and shot by their own government forces for 8 years now and nobody seemed to care. Finally someone decided to take action on their behalf. Praise to humanitarian actions of vladimir putin🙏🙏🙏
Putin is a madman. This makes no sense. Hope this doesn’t lead to WW3
 @MrNik0ne  Hey dumba$$ NATO cant right now as it would result in a fully scale world war, do you honestly want the world to end!!! Stop blaming pointlessly and blame those that started the war!!! AKA PUTIN
As an American im sick of our country being in other peoples wars. USA needs to stay outta this Europe war that mess non of our business.
 @Pandasrules  Hey dumba$$ NATO cant right now as it would result in a fully scale world war, do you honestly want the world to end!!! Stop blaming pointlessly and blame those that started the war!!! AKA PUTIN

Well, it's a war between Russia and the USA , Ukraine is only a battleground.
There are humans on other worlds? 👽?
 @Pandasrules  Russia has mostly outdated equipment and can’t spare to look at Africa right not with that’s going on in Europe I believe . They will probably focus on the response from other countries first
Dont worry my friend, NATO will add new sanctions on Russia and you will be just fine 🙂
If Ukrainians have a spirit of nationalism, they should take up arms instead of fleeing
 @unknown  Stupid, right?
Unfortunately west started this

You alien
Corrupt Europe donated in the dark, so much is our money, 17 billion euros to Ukraine, the people have not seen one. Do you really believe that Ukrainians are willing to be slaughtered for a bunch of pro-Nazi oligarchs with overflowing accounts abroad or for a puppet who came to power and immediately corrupted? Ukrainians will not fight for these corrupt, Putin knows.
peace!

Nobel Peace Committee are you seeing this?? This is what happens when you give Peace prize to a politician. Now Mr. Putin wants to show to the world who is the actual keeper of peace or on whose shoulders the peace lies safely in Europe. May be you should consider giving Mr. Putin a peace prize. Or a joint peace prize to Mr. Biden and Mr. Putin but that will surely bring Mr. Trump into picture and you should answer him as to why he should not be given the peace prize. So committee, in view of so many families being affected you should revise your policies...I wonder if a prize return from his rival politician will satisfy Mr. Putin's ego...
 @Devout Muslim  believe it or not Russia and China do allies with Muslim countries
 @СРБIN  many thanks.
 @Devout Muslim  Russia is ally #1 of China, and therefore supports the uyghur genocide in East China. It appears not Russia, China, or the west supports Muslims. Why should you side with Russia when neither are your peoples friends?
 @kevin maynard  Jesus is the power! God bless! Amen! He will come back and this war is the part of prophecy . . . it is coming.
 @徐振博  no chance. We were never part pf Russia, Ukraine is hundred years older than russia. Ukraine was occupied but never a part. We do want you russia, Ukraine will fight. Goodbye forever. There is no freedom in russia. They are all in jail (whoever wants freedom). Thank you, but, No
 @Cnupoc  people of Donbas are under russian invasion and propaganda. Ukraine lived very peacefully with our own life, yes, president elections, some revolutions, but it was ours. We lived how we liked till Putin decided for us what we like. I am crimean. Putin decided for me that I want him to come and save me from my own ukrainian people. But I am ukrainian. He came to save me from myself? I left my home and I do not go back. Thank you, Putin for taking it away from me. You are a murderer. No chance I will live in russia
 @dernbuy  this is lies, I am ukrainian!!! Putin is a murdere!!! Lier! everything he says - is a lie! You have no idea what is happening. We want to be left alone. And Donesk lived very peacefully till putin decided that he needs to save them. Really? I lived very peacefully in Crimea till putin decided to save me. I have a message for him, Putin, leave us alone forever. I do not need salvation from my own country. Ukraine 🟨🟦
 @Barlos Bainz Jr.  almost all muslim countries losing trust to USA.
Does this include the ethnic russians in Donbass (Ukraine) that have been fired at for 8 years by the ukrainian army and slowly starved to death by cutting power, water, food supplies, financial services? Of course western media did not report about that, but it's the hard reality on the ground.
 @Lena cy  everyone know that Ukraine was a creation by USSR. And USSR is a historical Russia name. Without Russia there will never be a Ukraine. More importantly, everyone know that USA just use Ukraine and play Ukraine, the only people that really cares about Ukraine people are Russians. Return to Russia is like return to home for Ukraine. Long live 🇷🇺🇨🇳、Ukraine is part of Russia just like Taiwan has always been part of China.
Because America and nato are the destroyers of this war, look at what has happened before, America is a coward who dares to attack, America is the destroyer of this world, facts, Read the history first. Ukraine used to be, what in Ukraine were mostly ethnic Russians, Russia had to protect its people from western Europeans, Mamarika and Natos
 @KARM  lol
Putin kill lives he is the one accountable the one to blame

Putin has finally crossed the line and now WAR is declared!! Putin is nothing more than a lying Russian dictator and a bully and will go down in history along side the likes of Stalin, Poi Pot, Saddam Hussein, Osama Bin Laden, Robert Mugabe, Genghis Khan, Idi Amin, Mao Tse-Tung,  and Hitler if he doesn’t turn his troops around and send the,back to Russia now.This is all down to the fact that Russia do not want Ukraine to join NATO and if he carry’s on The Hague will have him up for War crimes as he has absolutely NO RIGHT to do what he is doing after all what has Ukraine done to Russia ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.Putin says this is all self defence, well I don’t know how when Russia were the first to start  firing missiles, all Ukraine are doing are,just trying to defend themselves.AND REMEMBER PEOPLE LIKE RUSSIA OR NOT JUST REMEMBER THEY STARTED THIS NOT NATO, UKRAINE OR THE WEST
😭😭😭😭

 @Adam Beaulieu  Don't move goal posts. Hating the US and Israel is fair. But this has NOTHING to do with them, and EVERYTHING to do with Russian aggression. If you don't condemn Russia's invading army attacking citizens, you're a hypocrite no better than any of them.
 @Kyle Knight  I'm an American citizen stupid. My country and the terrorist country Israel do a hell of a lot worse, for decades and centuries.
